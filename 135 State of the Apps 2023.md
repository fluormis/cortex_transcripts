# Cortex - 135: State of the Apps 2023
**00:00:00** Okay

**00:00:01** Mean recording going let me put on some office mood lighting for cortex didn't know you did that

**00:00:06** Yeah, got it gotta put on some mood lighting for cortex. Okay. How do you cortex not with full bright office light short?

**00:00:13** Yeah, big overheads hate them, but you know, no choice. Really. That's terrible

**00:00:18** You want to have something a bit more chill for cortex? Okay. Okay, so I'm recording

**00:00:23** We're okay my notes so I have them

**00:00:26** Put away the script for the nightmare of that has been my life for the last nine months

**00:00:32** You don't want that right now

**00:00:35** Do you know why great why because it's time for state of the apps it is time for state of the apps state of the apps

**00:00:43** 2023

**00:00:48** About 2023 I know

**00:00:55** In our state of the apps episode every year we take stock of the apps and services that we use on our devices for work

**00:01:03** Entertainment just in general. Mm-hmm. We take a look at the things that we get value out of the things that we're enjoying

**00:01:09** Sometimes maybe two things that we're not but we can't get away from them and we share them with you the cortex

**00:01:14** And so this is like the one place, you know

**00:01:15** You can go every year to understand what the tools that we're using to get our work done

**00:01:20** And of course we use this as a new opportunity the annual opportunity now to share our home screens

**00:01:26** Which I actually think for me. I have a lot of home screens to show of you gray today

**00:01:31** Oh, how many home screens do you think you have to share was actually have more lock screens than home screens

**00:01:36** So I have three home screens as I tend to have I also have I think

**00:01:41** Three separate lock screens that I want to show you as well because that's the one of the big changes, right?

**00:01:47** We have lock screen widgets now, which is the thing that we didn't have last time that we did stay at the apps

**00:01:51** Yeah, the iOS 16 has brought a ton of visual changes to home screens and lock screens. I think I'm

**00:02:00** Mostly loving it. It's really nice to be able to do all of these customizations

**00:02:03** But yes, I also had the same thing of like oh wait, how many screenshots do I need to take today before the show?

**00:02:09** Oh a lot more than I have in the past. I've got my selection ready. I think I've got I've got the same thing

**00:02:15** I've got like three three and a half like different ones to show

**00:02:31** Yeah, I guess I guess yeah

**00:02:32** we should start with home screens and like focus modes and what's going on there because I feel like that's sort of the

**00:02:39** The like broadest way of how are we using our phones now?

**00:02:44** After like a big change to this entire system on Apple side. I'll say the focus mode stuff

**00:02:50** I'm really pleased about I

**00:02:52** Really love what they did with focus modes this year

**00:02:55** Just making them so easy to set up now because this is my main issue last time

**00:03:01** It should set up a focus mode and you had to manually

**00:03:05** Include every app and or person that could break through the focus mode and for me

**00:03:10** That's good for some stuff

**00:03:12** But not good for everything like I didn't want to create say like a recording focus mode because I would set it up say one

**00:03:19** Time but then over time is the apps that I use change

**00:03:23** I would need to remember to manually include the ones that I wanted to break through

**00:03:27** So now what I love is it with iOS 16 you get to choose opt-in and opt-out

**00:03:33** So you can say everyone and everything can contact me except these things

**00:03:38** And so like having that optionality has been great for me in setting up a couple of different focus modes

**00:03:44** I use some where it's opt-in and some where it's opt-out. It's actually made me use focus modes a lot

**00:03:49** I'm using them a lot now, which is not a thing I was doing before

**00:03:52** Yeah

**00:03:53** I feel like you really lucked out as like Apple addressed almost every single one of your issues directly whatever the last time is

**00:03:59** That we discussed this and also like with this whole focus mode system

**00:04:03** But I was just thinking about how this is what happens when like you introduce a new feature

**00:04:08** But like Apple often takes a while to introduce a feature and when they come out with it like oh

**00:04:12** It's actually pretty good

**00:04:13** And then we all fear like will they not touch it now for five years because they think it's good enough and with this system

**00:04:21** It's really nice to see that they've actually

**00:04:24** Repeatedly touched the way that it works and made improvements every year

**00:04:28** and cumulatively that stuff really like it really adds up into

**00:04:33** Smoothing out even just the smaller things like your complaints about having everything be opt-in or opt-out

**00:04:38** Just changing that little thing can really encourage users to pick up a system

**00:04:42** So I'm very encouraged and very happy to see that it's it's been continually improved every year

**00:04:48** and it's like this year suddenly a bunch of stuff has really come together and

**00:04:53** Made it very very useful to people. So what are your focus modes Mike?

**00:04:56** So my main focus modes that I have now I have travel

**00:05:02** Recording and I also have weekend and sleep. Hmm. So I'll start with the weekend and sleep ones

**00:05:09** because at the moment all I'm doing with those is just to basically just remove slack and

**00:05:16** Discord from there and I just have another widget in place instead. It just removes a couple of apps

**00:05:21** It's not really that exciting and it also locks me to just the one home screen

**00:05:26** And I have these really set up as a notifications

**00:05:31** Focused stuff rather than the home screen and lock screen stuff at the moment. So the key thing for me is email

**00:05:39** slack

**00:05:40** Discord all of those notifications get suppressed. So it's more about just

**00:05:45** De-emphasizing those applications. I don't remove my ability to access them

**00:05:49** but I don't have them on my home screen anymore and

**00:05:52** Any notifications that I get they get collected up into the like while in weekend focus thing

**00:05:58** so if I pull my

**00:06:00** Notifications down I don't even see those immediately

**00:06:02** I have to like actively go in to look at them and it's more just about

**00:06:07** Reminding me that when I've got weekend running which is obviously every weekend and when I've got sleep running which sets in every night

**00:06:13** That I should be using those apps and services less

**00:06:18** So that's pretty simple for me like as a thing

**00:06:21** And I think I do want to set up some specific lock screens and home screens for these that are more focused

**00:06:28** But I just haven't done that yet. It's really like the main thing for me. There is just removing some work apps from my lock screen and

**00:06:35** De-emphasizing the notifications and I also I'm sleep tracking now

**00:06:39** So sometimes I do it in the past like month or so

**00:06:41** And so I've wanted to set up the sleep focus to kind of get my devices in shape for that as well

**00:06:47** So I'm using the Apple watch to do the sleep tracking right so you're giving the weekend come on automatically and the sleep come on automatically

**00:06:53** Yeah, I don't use the like they have that like sleep alarm thing

**00:06:58** I don't use that because I want to be able to manually set my alarms

**00:07:02** And so they still make sound on my phone and my watch

**00:07:05** So if you set the alarms manually it will still do that if you use Apple's bedtime alarm thing

**00:07:10** It will only buzz the watch which is not enough for me to wake up

**00:07:13** I need both right, but I do really like having the both like I think I'm being woken up more easily

**00:07:19** Because the watch is an additional thing to help wake me up

**00:07:22** I've been enjoying that and I still want to go a little bit further

**00:07:25** I think into setting up some specific stuff like I saw as of the time of this recording

**00:07:32** 16.2 is in beta and the new medications feature of health

**00:07:37** I really like so I just look like my medications in there

**00:07:40** And they are making a lock screen medications widget

**00:07:44** To like no, you have got left to take or have you know

**00:07:48** So I think that that might be really nice for a sleep focus lock screen

**00:07:53** Because it will be there and will be as a good reminder of like you need to take your pills before you go to bed

**00:07:58** It was like a secondary thing so I might set that one up when that feature becomes available

**00:08:03** Yeah

**00:08:03** I'm gonna give that a try too because I actually just I just use the medications one for reminding me to take my

**00:08:09** Vitamins I thought like oh, let me just put this in this little system here because for some reason like take my vitamins is the to-do

**00:08:16** List item that I will like blow off the most I don't like it's just so funny. My brains like yeah sure we'll do that

**00:08:22** We'll just like check this off now and we'll get it in a second and then we never do yeah

**00:08:26** So I thought like oh, maybe if I try to put it in a completely different system

**00:08:29** This will like help me and it mostly does but I still feel like the medications one

**00:08:35** Like I was thinking about someone who might actually have difficulty remembering to take medications as opposed to me

**00:08:40** Who's just being like lazy and weird about it?

**00:08:43** I do feel like it it needs to get turned up one notch in terms of aggressiveness and

**00:08:50** Remindingness and maybe the lock screen one is something interesting to try there and just in terms of prominence. Yeah

**00:08:56** Yes before you go to bed like here's a here's a visual

**00:09:00** Nudge like you did not log taking your vitamins today, and you should do that so that's interesting

**00:09:06** I'll definitely give that a try when it comes around the medications feature in its current

**00:09:11** Interaction works best for people that stay on top of their notifications like I do yeah

**00:09:17** Because adena hasn't enjoyed it very much because she doesn't manage her

**00:09:21** Notifications like a wild person like I do like people don't manage their notifications the way that I do like I look at them

**00:09:27** All I remove them the ones that I don't want to leave the ones that I want to deal with

**00:09:31** That is not how most people deal with their notifications so the medicine can get lost in there

**00:09:36** I think they should be pinning it

**00:09:37** I think it should be pinned to the top of the lock screen until you do something to it

**00:09:41** Yeah, I completely agree that that's why I wanted to give it a test is like

**00:09:43** Oh, how does this separate system work?

**00:09:45** And it does feel like this should not get lost in the list along with everything else there

**00:09:51** There should be some kind of higher priority status for this one in particular

**00:09:56** But you know hopefully that is also a feature that Apple continues to return to and make small improvements on oh yeah

**00:10:02** I think a big difference they do that all the time now. Yeah, all right, so the focus is that I've done the most with our travel and

**00:10:10** Recording so I've got some screenshots for you here in the show notes so my travel lock screen

**00:10:15** I had previously had a travel home screen set up that we mentioned before that it basically gives me a bunch more widgets right like

**00:10:23** I use like a flighty widget and a fantastic how widget and a tripsy widget

**00:10:26** As well as just like bringing in the airline that I'm using

**00:10:31** I put their app on the home screen and the wallet app stuff like that right looks so that's like my travel home screen

**00:10:37** I'll take a screenshot of that and put it in the show notes just for reference to excite you think that's a pretty good one

**00:10:41** But I thought I would build a travel lock screen to go alongside it

**00:10:47** And so what we've got is I'm using one of Apple's pre-built lock screen options that they have now

**00:10:54** Mm-hmm, so they use this they have this called earth detail. Yes. Yes

**00:10:59** I was a couple of different options you can choose

**00:11:01** But it's basically like an animated globe as such right like I think it's using like the Apple Maps globe kind of thing

**00:11:08** And you can choose to like have a zoom level on it and what it's showing you at all times is where you are

**00:11:13** in the world and I thought that that was pretty cool as like a travel lock screen because I

**00:11:19** Would be somewhere else and my little doc would be in another place

**00:11:23** So I thought that I look pretty cool and then I've got some specific lock screen widgets to go alongside it

**00:11:29** So we've got the flighty widget like the flighty lock screen widget

**00:11:33** carrot weather and a widget Smith based step counter

**00:11:38** Along with fantastic how across the top and I thought that they were just like good at a glance things

**00:11:43** For my travel lock screen. It's I'm very intrigued. What's the 44 days until which one which widget is that that is flighty?

**00:11:51** Oh, this is like a funny thing where I took these screenshots

**00:11:56** Like a month ago. We were gonna talk about this in our previous episode, but we went rant way too long

**00:12:01** So I just have raised the screenshots

**00:12:03** I didn't realize that flighty will do the call down thing because of course Mike I'm with you

**00:12:09** This is obviously the best lock screen to use for any kind of travel mode

**00:12:13** So I've done the exact same thing and I put flighty on the top as well

**00:12:16** It's like yes, obviously that's the one you should pick like I think that they basically made this one

**00:12:22** To be for a travel focus mode like it's gotta be right. That's what someone put it there for it's perfect

**00:12:29** I have flighty on it as well, but I just didn't know that there was a countdown because I

**00:12:33** Just booked my flights to America like two days ago and I haven't actually put them into flighty yet

**00:12:39** So I didn't realize that it does like a cool countdown days until flight thing. So that's really nice

**00:12:43** I didn't know that can I ask what's the thing that you blurred out on the very top?

**00:12:46** That's the fantastic how one that's blurred out of like yeah next event is that's the next event whatever it was

**00:12:52** I didn't want everyone to know what

**00:12:56** Right, but it's too long ago now you can't remember

**00:12:58** I guess send you mine so you can see that we've basically done the exact same thing for the travel screens because I think it's

**00:13:05** Just it's just obviously the most sensible one to do. Oh, yeah, look at that

**00:13:08** All right, so you've got oh, that's a good idea. You've got your AirPods Max battery on there

**00:13:14** Yeah, mmm

**00:13:15** I might steal that

**00:13:18** Because that's when I care about the battery for those things the most is when I'm traveling

**00:13:22** Yeah for me the lock screen widget that is the battery where it automatically picks which thing to show you

**00:13:30** To me is like clearly the best lock screen widget and should be by default and like every single one of them

**00:13:36** I think it's it's like the most sensible place to show battery status for something that you probably care about

**00:13:42** I don't know quite what their algorithm is for rotating between things. It doesn't seem like

**00:13:47** Perfect, but it's good enough and I love it for keeping an eye on like

**00:13:52** Oh

**00:13:52** my headphones in my office are

**00:13:54** Unplugged and I can see now that like they run low because like that's the one that it that starts showing up

**00:14:00** So yeah

**00:14:00** And I feel like especially when you're traveling the I need to keep track of how charged everything is is like super high priority

**00:14:07** It feels like it just has to be on a lock screen for travel, you know, you can choose though, right?

**00:14:12** Okay, so we can get to that in a second. Yes

**00:14:14** I know that you can force an item but I think leaving it on auto is is mostly the sensible decision

**00:14:21** Okay, I'm gonna try on auto because my AirPods Max are not here and in an upgrade to my phone right now

**00:14:25** It seems so let me make the change

**00:14:28** But I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna use that I did have a little complaint that I wanted to levy for focus modes

**00:14:34** Which is the switching between focus modes. So let's imagine I am

**00:14:41** traveling on the weekend so I have my weekend focus mode automatically enabled and

**00:14:47** I want to manually switch to my travel focus mode

**00:14:52** Right because I'm in transit, but then when I arrive at my destination

**00:14:55** I would like to turn off that focus mode

**00:14:59** But I would like to go to the previously enabled focus mode rather than the default

**00:15:05** Because this also happens that like if I have my travel focus mode on and the weekend comes around during the travel

**00:15:11** It's gonna flip over the weekend, which is not what I want, right?

**00:15:14** So I would like to be able to once you enable a focus mode

**00:15:18** once it turns off even if it's turning off by like an automation of some kind that it goes back to

**00:15:25** The previous one. Yeah, we're slightly jumping ahead to the app recommendation section of the show

**00:15:30** But I there's a there's an app which I've been using I've been trialing with shortcuts just a little bit

**00:15:36** But it's called data jar and it's an app that lets you like store

**00:15:40** information permanently like as a little variable outside the shortcut system and I have actually been trying to solve this

**00:15:48** Exact problem with that and I think it should be you should be able to have data jar remember

**00:15:55** Not what is the current focus mode, but what is the last focus mode? I've already set it up

**00:16:00** So it's like oh, yes, I can definitely have this little app

**00:16:04** Remember what the previous one was and I'm just now trying to work through the okay

**00:16:09** so when I turn something off I want you to

**00:16:12** Check with data jar for what the last one was and then go to that instead of Wow by default opening up the phone

**00:16:19** That sounds like it's gonna be really complicated to set up

**00:16:22** No data jar is actually really simple like I've just came across it

**00:16:26** So I haven't had a huge chance to play with it

**00:16:28** But I think it's like it is exactly for these kinds of problems where there's some sort of automation

**00:16:34** That it depends on what was something like a little while ago

**00:16:39** Not just what is the current state of everything now?

**00:16:42** So I've been kind of toying around with it, but it's like one of my ooh

**00:16:45** This can be a really interesting app for automation going forward in 2023

**00:16:49** And this feels like exactly the kind of problem that I think could be able to be solved for it

**00:16:55** I'll mention that now as a little preview for the app section bit by Simon Stovering made scriptable. I know it's an app

**00:17:01** It's very popular. Oh, they're the same people made scriptable. Okay, that makes sense. That makes sense

**00:17:05** I didn't realize my recording lock screen and focus mode is the one that I use the most

**00:17:11** So okay

**00:17:12** I had a recording focus mode set up for a while and it basically turns off all notifications

**00:17:17** When I'm recording a show and I usually enable this I have a shortcut that turns on my recording focus

**00:17:24** For X amount of hours and sets a timer for me for the specific show that I'm doing. I was using that before

**00:17:31** But now I get to tie in a lock screen to it

**00:17:34** Which has been really good because of the always-on display

**00:17:37** So when I'm recording I put my phone in a dock I have a material doc from studio knee

**00:17:43** I put it in there. It just stands and just stands there. So it's just off to the side and

**00:17:48** So I thought well what kind of information might I want when I'm recording a show?

**00:17:52** And so I have a couple of widgets there. I have the calendar one again. I have my timer e

**00:17:59** Lock screen widgets and then I have a world clock built with widget Smith with a few different locations

**00:18:06** Oh, that's how you okay. That's how you did it

**00:18:08** I was looking at that thinking like this this layout of the widgets is a little bit funny

**00:18:12** But you're using widget Smith. Yeah to show the three different ones. Ah, okay, right. So it's two two sized ones

**00:18:19** It's not for right. Okay. Yeah, but the way that we just miss that you do it

**00:18:24** You can have more locations in that but I felt like three looked visually good

**00:18:27** And that's what I need the most it's just like didn't American time zones and then for this one

**00:18:32** I'm using the photo shuffle lock screen

**00:18:36** So it's a lock screen that basically another one that Apple made where every time you lock the phone or unlock the phone

**00:18:44** It changes the image and you can do people places and buildings for this wine hot dogs dogs Apple. Come on

**00:18:53** They have a dog's one I'll be surprised if they didn't but you have some

**00:18:58** Customization for how the photo shuffle works. Yes people nature and cities. They're your categories

**00:19:05** But with the people one you can choose

**00:19:08** specific people

**00:19:11** Okay, so I set my own up to just be pictures of my wife and so it just cycles through the faces album or whatever

**00:19:18** I have there. I enjoy that and it's also

**00:19:21** Visually different enough that I realize kind of like that I'm in my recording focus, which I also just like as like a visual

**00:19:27** So that one's a really good one, too

**00:19:28** Can you select multiple people under the people option or is it just one?

**00:19:32** So I think you can set multiple people which will probably help with the dogs things

**00:19:36** I think you could set animals or am I remembering I photo. I think I'm

**00:19:42** You're remembering what I told you I photo used to do ten years ago. Yeah, it's still a bee in my bonnet

**00:19:47** That's why that's in my mind

**00:19:49** I put that there right you're having like implanted memories now, but no I was thinking for your recording lock screen

**00:19:55** Mike you should obviously I mean like your wife is lovely

**00:19:58** But you should have it rotate through photos of all of your co-hosts for the recording ones like that's what you should be doing

**00:20:03** Right, you know what that's actually not a bad idea

**00:20:07** Yeah, I think you should do that. It should be all the people that you co-host pond podcasts with

**00:20:11** That's why I want to know if it can do multiple ones. I could be smiling at you right now from your long screen

**00:20:16** I do have a few photos of you smiling that is true

**00:20:19** It would be extra good if it could just like pick out the specific people that I'm recording of at any one time

**00:20:25** But then I would need an obscene amount of focus moves to be set up to do that and there's actually a limit of ten

**00:20:31** I don't know if you did not know that this is like a small thing that I bumped into which I do find slightly

**00:20:38** infuriating but pre iOS 16 there wasn't a limit on focus modes and

**00:20:44** iOS 16 they introduced a limit of 10

**00:20:48** Which is actually a little bit tighter than you think because it includes the two ones that are there by default

**00:20:54** Or the three that are there by default do not disturb driving and sleep

**00:20:58** So it's really a limit of seven that you can choose

**00:21:02** But like I kind of wonder if that was like, oh this is there because of two people

**00:21:07** Federico Vittici and me like put sending in like a million focus modes and they're like no no

**00:21:13** Right. This is too many

**00:21:14** But yeah

**00:21:14** It was actually confirmed by Apple that that was not a bug like that was an engineering decision that they had made that they were going

**00:21:19** To limit it to ten. It's wild because you can set up 200 custom lock screens. So why couldn't you only do ten focus modes?

**00:21:26** Yeah, there must be some UI issue that like there's an area of the UI that like maybe the the

**00:21:33** Control center thing where they don't want to scroll. No, but that doesn't make sense because I already scroll on there

**00:21:37** I find this stuff

**00:21:39** Super frustrating and it's extra frustrating when it used to be one way and then it goes the other way

**00:21:44** It kind of reminds me of I think that they did eventually remove but there used to be a limit of 100 VIPs on mail

**00:21:50** and it was like again, it's like clear that someone just like picked a number that they thought was really big that no one would surpass and

**00:21:57** I think like me and Gruber were complaining about that like oh depending on how you run your email

**00:22:01** Like that's extremely frustrating to have this limit for absolutely no reason. So anyway, just like FYI

**00:22:07** To anyone out there who's like I'm gonna do a focus mode for everything. No, you're not like you're gonna pick seven

**00:22:12** That's what you're gonna pick. Well, I mean you can do everything if you have ten things, right?

**00:22:16** Yeah, if you have seven things can't you change the like because I don't have the driving one

**00:22:21** Are you sure you want to take a look like I'm I thought that was like hard coded in there that you couldn't get rid

**00:22:26** Of the driving do not disturb fitness recording sleep travel weekend. That's so weird. Have you never

**00:22:32** Driven I remember removing it but that was probably lost

**00:22:37** That's interesting. Okay. All right, so I'm just look I'm just looking now

**00:22:41** So I mean driving I will leave on there because when I'm in America, I do drive and I do find it useful to have

**00:22:47** But the driving one is different so you can delete that focus mode, right?

**00:22:52** But do not disturb and sleep you call hard-coded in you can't get rid of those

**00:22:58** Okay, that's interesting. Okay, so if you don't drive you can have eight

**00:23:02** I didn't realize that interesting the last one I have to show you lock screens. It's just my regular lock screen

**00:23:07** It's not too dissimilar from the other ones that I have I have

**00:23:11** Fantastic hours the main on the top, right? It's like the one big one on the top

**00:23:16** Along with carrot weather time Marie and a step counter in widgets myth

**00:23:21** That's my kind of like main lock screen, which is not tied to focus modes. Okay, so that's the like the default open one

**00:23:27** Yeah, right. Okay. So what do you I want to see yours now?

**00:23:30** You'll do you have you want to show me focus mode ones first. I've seen the travel one. Do you have any others?

**00:23:35** Yes, I'm also I'm also having like a funny situation in my office

**00:23:40** So I've been really trying to do like home automation this year and partly with the lights and things

**00:23:45** But for this show while I keep flipping through the focus modes to look at things while we're talking the lights in my office

**00:23:50** I'm going crazy, right? So it's like I wanted I wanted all of these like

**00:23:54** Chill I wanted like the chillest version of the lights where it's like I have everything real down low

**00:23:59** And I picked these like blues and greens and it's very lovely

**00:24:02** But then every time it's like oh I went into sleep mode. The office is completely dark. No, I don't know

**00:24:07** I went to travel mode the lights went completely white

**00:24:10** I'm flicking around taking screenshots on my mic. My Mac is like you're traveling. I'm like, I'm not I'm not traveling back stop it

**00:24:18** That's funny. I guess if if I've done that stuff and I don't remember things are flying off the handle all over the place

**00:24:25** That's really funny. Yeah, so it's just like automation is great

**00:24:28** But it's it's like when you are talking about automation and rapidly flipping through a bunch of things like it starts to get weird

**00:24:34** And every time the office lights either completely go away or turn all the way on

**00:24:38** It's like oh with your real mood killer here office lights

**00:24:40** But that is also part of the thing I'm trying to do with data jar is to like smooth that stuff out

**00:24:45** Like don't just look at the state of things right now

**00:24:48** Remember like what were things like five minutes ago and maybe chill out and don't change things if you don't need to okay

**00:24:53** So let me send you some of my stuff. I already

**00:24:56** Sent you my sleep lock screen and home screen

**00:25:00** Which I just basically have as empty as possible and just pick it as like dark red

**00:25:05** For go to sleep now like this is time. That's what they are cuz okay a

**00:25:10** Minute ago. I saw that I had two images from gray

**00:25:14** one was a

**00:25:16** Blank lock screen with a couple of widgets on and one was a completely blank home screen

**00:25:22** I was like oh here we go again

**00:25:24** Maybe I'm gonna find out later on that your actual lock screen is like this again

**00:25:28** But I didn't want to react to it in the moment because it would have like destroyed the flow of the episode

**00:25:34** But maybe we'll get back to that later on so this is your it's not black

**00:25:38** It's like a red because that's good for eyes right I've learned recently

**00:25:42** Yeah

**00:25:43** I think red like a very dark red just works well at night and I actually picked a little real dark red because

**00:25:49** It sort of makes the contrast with the icons on the bottom less like the icons on the bottom seem brighter if there's absolutely

**00:25:57** No color on the home screen

**00:25:59** So that that's just why I have it kind of set as this like gradient red that they allow

**00:26:04** So my like sleep lock screen and home screen are super boring. There's a thing that's happening there though

**00:26:09** so if you look at the

**00:26:11** Sleep lock home screen. There's a funny bug that happens with this little battery meter

**00:26:17** The automatic battery one if you pick the lock screen widget to be the little circle battery

**00:26:24** Yeah, but like I do it's like you know what I want one of them

**00:26:28** I want to be the watch like I always want to know the watch

**00:26:31** Before I'm going to bed just to keep an eye on it like ooh

**00:26:34** Do I need to charge it up a little bit before I go to sleep?

**00:26:37** but if you have

**00:26:38** One of them manually set to the watch the automatic one

**00:26:42** I think it's like built in by default that it kind of like always goes to the watch if it doesn't know what to do

**00:26:48** And so you end up with these two little watches

**00:26:52** Like he's one of backup like check like what is going on

**00:26:57** Yeah, and it like it creates this little like the phone is looking at you it kind of

**00:27:05** There's a face it's a little bit like a face and it's extremely hard to

**00:27:10** Screenshot so that I'm gonna send you something that I was trying to catch like just while we're recording

**00:27:15** While we're talking about this like funny bug so

**00:27:19** Here is just like the top of my work home screen where I have the same thing where it's like

**00:27:24** This is like that have the phone would look for me in the morning

**00:27:27** There's two battery icons one of which I want to set to the watch in the morning

**00:27:31** So I always know if to charge it and one is the automatic other one

**00:27:35** But it very often like when the phone is just sitting there defaults to having both of them

**00:27:40** And I put the activity thing in the center and then it really creates this like little face going

**00:27:46** Oh, like you got this like this look screen has got like like it's like a rectangle

**00:27:53** This is like the mouth to me. Yeah. Yeah

**00:27:56** The activity in the center is like a funny a funny thing like Apple

**00:28:02** Dimms the circles on the activity meter in a way that I find really frustrating. It's like

**00:28:08** Performative privacy of like ooh if your phone is locked

**00:28:12** We don't want anyone to know how active you've been today if they found the phone which is like, please Apple

**00:28:17** Like no one cares about this

**00:28:18** This is just you like going out of your way to show me how much you care about my privacy

**00:28:23** When like I'd much rather prefer that you had encrypted my iCloud messages

**00:28:28** Even if I used iCloud backup and like not, you know

**00:28:31** Prevented people from knowing if I exercised this morning or not

**00:28:34** Can I just double down and say because you brought that up and that's like one of my big bug bears and I 100%

**00:28:39** Agree of you and I think it's absolutely ridiculous that they have not made that a thing

**00:28:43** It's like you can look into this. Maybe you didn't know cortexes

**00:28:46** But if you use I message in the cloud it's called with it like backs up your messages think some across you're no longer

**00:28:54** Enter and encrypted there is an encryption key that Apple holds and yeah

**00:28:59** There was a bunch of technical reasons as to why they do this

**00:29:03** But I don't care. I

**00:29:05** Want I want the encryption like if you wanted to have encryption you can't have my message backup

**00:29:10** And this isn't the case for a bunch of other things with health. It's that's not the case

**00:29:16** Mm-hmm, they don't hold the keys for that but they hold the keys for I message and I want them to change that

**00:29:21** Thank you for bringing that up. Yeah, I mean

**00:29:23** Since this is a very Apple focused episode that to me is I think it's kind of the worst thing that Apple

**00:29:31** Does and I think it makes all of their messaging about privacy sound like a lie to me

**00:29:37** Which is the thing that everyone cares?

**00:29:41** the most about I

**00:29:43** Mean I bet a lot of people would care way more about their I messages than their photos, right?

**00:29:48** They're like those have got to be the top two

**00:29:50** Yeah, I think there are a lot of people who it's like hey

**00:29:52** You have to pick one of these two to be leaked to the world your I messages or your photos. I

**00:29:57** Think a lot more people would rather have their photos leaked and their I messages Lee

**00:30:01** I think so I would yeah, but yeah, so when when I found out I was like

**00:30:05** Oh Apple doesn't actually end-to-end encrypt your I messages if you use iCloud backup, which they

**00:30:12** Extremely pushed you to do for good reasons. I was like that is a polling like I'm totally appalled by this and

**00:30:19** It really gets under my skin every time Apple talks about how they care about privacy and it's like yeah

**00:30:25** You're not saying out loud the one thing that people care about the most

**00:30:31** So when I first found out about it, I was like, oh my god, right?

**00:30:34** And I turned off iCloud backup on all of my devices and I was using just like the local backup on your computer

**00:30:39** But then I realized oh it doesn't matter at all because if the person I'm talking with uses iCloud backup

**00:30:45** Like it hasn't prevented anything here

**00:30:47** Yeah

**00:30:48** So great like I'm just so I went back to using iCloud backup and I just live with it

**00:30:52** but I really hate it, but it is also why like I call the

**00:30:56** Activity ring hiding on the lock screen like performative privacy. It's a thing that absolutely no one cares about

**00:31:04** But I think Apple does because it's like look at us keeping an eye on your privacy

**00:31:09** We'll keep this private health data how many times you've stood up today?

**00:31:14** You know hidden on your lock screen until it is unlocked and I find it annoying

**00:31:18** Because then every time I look at the lock screen like the little circles then

**00:31:22** Color in and I would like the whole purpose of having it there is I just want to see the information

**00:31:26** I don't only want to see the information when the screen is unlocked

**00:31:29** But so anyway complaining about Apple privacy aside here is what that actual lock screen looks like

**00:31:34** So to me, this is the like the most important how my phone looks mode and this is what I call core

**00:31:42** Which is my like morning work and this is the most I mean I guess aside from sleep

**00:31:47** This is the most locked down mode of like I don't want to get messages from anybody

**00:31:53** This is how the phone should default on any of my work days

**00:31:58** Nothing gets through and I just want to have it be entirely work focused

**00:32:01** So I just have the couple of battery icons there because I want to keep an eye on like the headphones and like I said

**00:32:07** I want to have the watch to know how charged it is

**00:32:09** I do like having activity there because I often do most of my like actual exercise in the morning

**00:32:15** So I feel like that's kind of part of the of what I'm doing for the core stuff and then on my home screen

**00:32:21** I don't use a bunch of apps

**00:32:23** I just have like the widgets for

**00:32:25** OmniFocus to show me like the top level stuff that I should be doing and then I have timer e which is giving me like a report

**00:32:32** For today and the last x days so I can just kind of keep an eye on like

**00:32:37** Oh, how am I actually doing in terms of work both for now and over the recent past?

**00:32:42** So this is how I'm setting up like my core focus mode. So this is core focus mode. Okay, so this is a focus mode

**00:32:48** It's a pairing of the two. Is that like your mind spaceship you is that what this is? Oh

**00:32:54** Yeah, it's not really on purpose. Okay. Yeah, the lock screen is just like it's it is from NASA

**00:32:59** And I think it's the inside of a satellite. I just kind of think it looks cool and

**00:33:04** I just strongly associate blue with like all the important work

**00:33:08** So yeah, it wasn't intentionally spaceship you but it's like spaceship you adjacent

**00:33:12** I couldn't personally use this image because it doesn't line up that line from the top. I know. Okay. I know

**00:33:22** Cuz it's too close that's the problem. Yeah for listeners

**00:33:26** There's a little bit of like a vertical line which is like very close but not quite lined up

**00:33:30** Yeah, it has been on my mind at some point

**00:33:32** I'm gonna like get this from there was like NASA's Instagram or whatever and like load it into Photoshop and actually adjust it

**00:33:38** Because I do like it enough that it's worth fixing around

**00:33:42** But I originally just set this when I was when I was like starting to play around with the focus modes of feeling like

**00:33:48** Oh, what am I gonna use? What am I not gonna use and this one is just kind of stuck

**00:33:52** But yes, I will at some point fix that alignment issue because you're not wrong

**00:33:56** It's super annoying that it doesn't quite go right down the center

**00:33:59** And I also feel like with the new dynamic island at the top it like extra highlights it like when I first set this up

**00:34:05** It wasn't there but now the dynamic island really like letting you know like hey buddy

**00:34:10** You can see how not in the middle. This is

**00:34:15** So you have just the one home screen here yeah timer on executor

**00:34:21** Executor that's that's the way that a project name

**00:34:24** No, that's just like the word that I have used for a subset of Omni focus tasks, which are not project specific

**00:34:31** They are just the this is what you should do ideally every morning

**00:34:36** So there are things like okay

**00:34:38** Here's me running through like getting the office set up every morning

**00:34:42** And then it just lists depending on what day it is which thing I should be doing so it's like okay

**00:34:47** This is the day where you should be walking on the treadmill for an hour and a half while you talk the script out loud

**00:34:53** And then like after that you should exercise for this amount of time

**00:34:56** And then you should do another draft at the computer sitting down for this amount of time

**00:35:01** And then it's like take a 20-minute break, and then it's admin

**00:35:04** It's sort of like running through what is the theoretical best list of things to do without being

**00:35:11** Project specific on any one of them

**00:35:13** So it's like it's like nudging me in the correct order of the routine

**00:35:17** And so I don't like I feel like it's like

**00:35:20** Executive like the top level of tasks is kind of why I named it that way

**00:35:24** But I've been using this for years and years as a non project specific

**00:35:29** Reminder list for what you should be doing first thing in the morning. Okay, so like you

**00:35:35** That alternates for me with like a weekend focus

**00:35:41** Oh very lengthy yeah, so I want to have like two strong colors to again just like

**00:35:48** Set up environmentally like how should the day feel like I'm just I'm a big believer in trying like make everything

**00:35:55** Kind of go along with a certain way and so for me green has always been really associated with like oh

**00:35:59** This is the personal time and so I have it set up with the home automation stuff and with a bunch of shortcuts

**00:36:06** If it's Wednesday or I'm now doing Saturday as my other weekend day

**00:36:09** Like this is the way the phone starts in the morning, which again

**00:36:13** It's just like a nice visual reminder of like this should be a day off and again

**00:36:17** I like to keep the lock screen reasonably simple, but I feel like for days off

**00:36:20** I'm much more likely to go outside. So I just have a couple of weather widgets on there

**00:36:24** Mainly knowing for like if I'm gonna take a bike ride

**00:36:27** I want to know what like the chance of rain is gonna be like for the day and that's also why on my actual

**00:36:32** Home screen I have a

**00:36:34** Carrot weather thing like big and on the top because that's also just useful for or like my wife and I are we gonna go out

**00:36:40** To the park are we gonna go somewhere or is it gonna be an indoor sort of day?

**00:36:44** So I just like to have the weather big and prominent and it again. It's also there to kind of

**00:36:49** Nudge me in the remind direction that's like it's the weekend

**00:36:53** Maybe you should go outside because you often don't on work days

**00:36:57** Yeah, if carrots saying it's a beautiful day, dude, you should take advantage of that

**00:37:01** I mean and who wouldn't want to jump in this bush that you've got here on the home screen

**00:37:06** With like I will say the thing about this bush, it's like beautiful and green on the top, but there is like the abyss

**00:37:16** Do you feel slightly threatened by my lock screen image is that a little bit

**00:37:19** I don't like how dark it is between the leaves on this image. Well nature is very scary Mike even when it's beautiful

**00:37:26** Terrifying I guess it's like this home screen is like go outside but beware

**00:37:31** You know, yeah, I want you to go

**00:37:34** Should go outside but just be careful, you know, I get that as a good as a good balance. I

**00:37:42** Will question I mean I guess not it's not for you

**00:37:45** Right like that you have on the home screen that you sent me

**00:37:48** There are two time re widgets and what my initial thought was like do you want to be tracking your time that much on the weekend?

**00:37:55** But then I remember you're always tracking your time, right? Like that's the difference between me and you so yeah

**00:37:59** So I have a slightly differently set up like it's not as prominent but it's this thing of yeah

**00:38:05** I do always track my time and that's partly

**00:38:09** Again because I am using it as like a reminder for how I should be

**00:38:14** And so the two-timer e-trackers on my weekend home screen are the same thing where I have one that's set up to track

**00:38:21** How is today doing and then the bottom one tracks like this a certain X number of past days

**00:38:27** And what I'm always trying to do is like approach a theoretical

**00:38:33** optimal thing and so what I want to see is oh as the day is going on on the weekend day my

**00:38:40** Today time re should be filling up with stuff that it doesn't fill up with during the weekday

**00:38:46** So it's like oh there's actually I've added something this year. This is again jumping ahead, but I'll just mention it now

**00:38:52** Where I track how much time I spend with my wife, but this year I realized oh, you know what?

**00:38:56** I'm gonna break out a separate category which is like with wife

**00:39:01** but outside of the house as a little timer and

**00:39:05** So I really like having this as like a separate kind of thing to track

**00:39:09** It's like tracking a kind of high quality time and so I just want to see like oh if in the past

**00:39:16** 10 days

**00:39:17** The time with wife time has like racked up very high, but none of it has been outside of the house

**00:39:23** It's just like a little nudge on the weekend like hey

**00:39:26** Maybe we should get out of here and go do something so that's why I do have the timer e timer is like really prominent

**00:39:32** because I'm always trying to match like

**00:39:35** The last X days is getting affected by time recorded today

**00:39:40** And you want to always try to like approach?

**00:39:43** The optimal of how things should be so the weekend days should be adding like different weekend activities

**00:39:49** Like reading or going outside or taking a bike ride

**00:39:52** And then the work days should be adding work day stuff and so that that's why I do keep it around there

**00:39:58** Okay, that makes a lot of sense

**00:39:59** And then I just have an Omni focus one which is like

**00:40:02** Available tasks because sometimes there's like just stuff that you need to do

**00:40:06** It's like not work stuff and weekend days are days that it makes sense to do that

**00:40:10** So that's why I have Omni focus available there. We went through the travel one. That's the work one

**00:40:14** I got a couple others that are not interesting to talk about just because it's like admin. It's basically the same thing. I do have a

**00:40:23** Didn't screenshot it because it's not visually interesting, but I'm trying to have the phone be

**00:40:29** Always in a focus mode. I feel like this is probably the best way to think about stuff

**00:40:34** And so one thing I did set was a focus mode that I call open

**00:40:38** Where it is the phone is open to all messages from everyone Wow, you enable that like for 20 minutes once a year

**00:40:46** Yes, so that's like oh I'm expecting a call from someone who's not in my phone book or whatever

**00:40:53** And so that's like I can throw it into the open mode

**00:40:56** Because that is a thing that comes up every once in a while of like oh you're expecting someone to contact you

**00:41:02** But for whatever reason you don't know in advance their contact information or whatever

**00:41:08** So I've gotten kind of caught out by that sometimes and so it's like okay. I have an open mode

**00:41:12** It's like you're waiting for a callback from your internet prod or whatever right? It's like you don't yeah exactly that exactly

**00:41:19** Yeah

**00:41:20** Yeah, like oh

**00:41:21** There's a plumber coming to the house maybe and he might call you who knows that that kind of thing and I just I just use

**00:41:27** Apple's like default moon they have a picture of the moon because it feels like oh my god if it's open

**00:41:32** You're just like floating in space vulnerable to anyone at any point in time, so that's the image that I use for that

**00:41:38** But the other one that I think you might enjoy I'll send this through is

**00:41:44** I have a focus mode called

**00:41:47** holiday

**00:41:49** Eastborn receiving baby now. This is fun

**00:41:53** So the thing about holidays is that they should be novel right things should feel different when you're on a holiday than they feel normally

**00:42:00** You were the little love heart and

**00:42:03** Holiday name that's cute. Yeah. Well. It's also cuz like that's usually I'm spending that with my wife

**00:42:07** and so it's like we're off somewhere and

**00:42:10** The holiday one it's at basically so that it's like my wife can contact me family can contact me

**00:42:15** And if I'm traveling with friends like those friends can contact me

**00:42:19** But I specifically turn off like everything that's work related for the holiday stuff

**00:42:24** And so in the screenshot that I have for Mike here

**00:42:27** I have like a fun sort of pink sand background which I've just used as the default like this looks really different

**00:42:35** For my wife, and I have done a couple of weekends away this year

**00:42:38** And so it's just like flip it into holiday mode and then for the couple of trips that I've done

**00:42:43** This is pre-focus mode, but I was still using shortcuts to do it

**00:42:46** I had the holiday mode like pick a wallpaper that matches the trip so when I was in Hawaii like I had a very Hawaii shirt

**00:42:54** Kind of background and when I was in Norway. I had like a snowy icy background and I don't know

**00:43:01** I this may sound dumb, but I really think there's a lot of value in

**00:43:05** Even just like silly novelty on devices that are with you all the time

**00:43:09** And so like when I've done a weekend away and my phone is ridiculously pink

**00:43:14** It somehow helps make that little mini trip like feel more different during the time

**00:43:19** And it's again like a visual reminder of like this is how you're spending your time

**00:43:23** You're focused on this this weird holiday

**00:43:25** It's even why I picked like this strange font for the time is like I just want everything different

**00:43:30** I probably should change the little battery widgets, which is on the home screen

**00:43:33** That's not useful anymore, but I just haven't had the system come in since focus came out

**00:43:36** So that'll get swapped out with something. There's the weather because that's what you want to know on holidays

**00:43:40** I have the maps on the bottom which I've completely blacked out because obviously it shows your exact current location

**00:43:46** But that's super useful when you're on holidays, and then I've mentioned this before but I do find it really useful that

**00:43:52** When you're on a trip with someone it just feels like you end up with a bunch of these weird little

**00:43:57** Like oh we need to pick up some aspirin for from booths kind of errands that like the two of you have while you're on

**00:44:04** Like this little trip

**00:44:05** And so my wife and I have a like shared errands list that gets used a lot during holidays

**00:44:11** I'm like oh

**00:44:11** Let's not forget when we go here to pick up that thing

**00:44:14** And so I just like to have that on the reminders list and it's just like as soon as we started doing it

**00:44:19** It's crazy how much it gets used and also just how much nicer it can make the trip that like oh both of us

**00:44:25** We can remember to do this thing or she can add something to the list for me to do so it's not always pink

**00:44:31** It'll be different if I go somewhere else, but this is this is my holiday focus mode

**00:44:36** So I thought you might appreciate this one Mike. I do I like it a lot

**00:44:39** I like how bright it is the shared errands is smart too

**00:44:42** I guess maybe it's just a luck that it matches up color wise with the home screen

**00:44:47** No, no you can pick it you can pick reminder list colors

**00:44:49** But like do you change it to like thematically work with the current home screen for that trip?

**00:44:55** Oh, yeah, yeah, I did that when we were in Hawaii like the Hawaii lock screen was like largely green

**00:45:00** So I just changed a little thing to be green so got a color coordinate my love how aesthetic you are here

**00:45:05** It's great. This is awesome. Okay, you go well

**00:45:08** It's it's interesting because I think with this focus mode system that apples introduced

**00:45:12** I also try to have my watch match all of this stuff and

**00:45:16** I used to do this with shortcuts where when you change focus modes

**00:45:21** You could have shortcuts sort of change stuff for you

**00:45:23** But boy was that a giant pain in the butt and I just like apples made it a hundred times easier now to do this

**00:45:30** And so it feels like why not take advantage of it? And I really do think it makes the phone much better and

**00:45:36** For me this also feels a bit like almost validation of years ago

**00:45:40** I was I was just talking about how like I think this is really important for devices that you have with you know

**00:45:46** like all the time to try to make them different and

**00:45:49** You know in early episodes of cortex

**00:45:52** I know I got a lot of flack from people thinking I was crazy for having like oh

**00:45:56** There's two iPads like a work iPad and a personal iPad and people like what are you doing that for?

**00:46:01** And now like software wise Apple has made this possible more and more on your devices and I just like I love it

**00:46:09** I think it's great and I can't wait for this to get rolled out presumably to the iPad

**00:46:13** I don't know maybe next year and like max the year after or something

**00:46:16** But it's so good like I'm just so happy that Apple has has introduced this and it's really nice to be able to have the home

**00:46:24** screens themselves change like that's a feature I was never even really asking for and it was sort of around in the last version but

**00:46:31** Again, it was like fiddly and hard to do but now with the focus modes being able to switch the actual home screens themselves. It's great

**00:46:38** I love it two thumbs up for this whole system

**00:46:41** And if listeners haven't tried focus modes

**00:46:43** You should totally try it like just I think the very basic one of like what's a workday like and what's a weekend day?

**00:46:50** Like and then what's you know the afternoon like those are the basic ones and set them up and give them a try and

**00:46:57** You know pick different fun lock screens so that it just looks visually different

**00:47:01** I think it really adds something to your life and doubly so now that there's like an always on screen for the phones like it's

**00:47:06** Just increasingly present in this way. So shall we do home screens?

**00:47:11** Themselves now. I don't really have home screens to show you right because what like what we've gone through here is

**00:47:17** Basically everything on my home screens. Okay, so there are no apps anymore. It's it's either

**00:47:22** Yeah widgets on nothing, right? Okay, so you've I've seen them all I understand I understand so like right if you're I get it

**00:47:29** I've seen everything

**00:47:30** Oh, if you're always in a focus mode, there is no home screen anymore. It's always what is relevant

**00:47:38** All right, that makes sense. Yes, so that's what I've done

**00:47:41** I've kind of simplified away the home screen stuff and I'm just really using my phone to

**00:47:48** Display whatever relevant information is in whatever mode like we can cover my home screen in three seconds

**00:47:54** which is that I have three little buttons in my dock that I've slightly changed from last year and

**00:48:00** Those buttons are make a new note in notes

**00:48:03** The center one is for Omni focus which opens up a general list of I have a reminder and then it asks me a couple of

**00:48:11** Questions like is this a due date reminder? Is this a flag reminder? Oh, it's it's an ad is to add to a list

**00:48:16** Yes, so it's to add to a list

**00:48:18** Yeah, the three on the bottom are purely input

**00:48:21** so the middle one is for Omni focus and then it asks a bunch of questions so it knows properly where to sort things and

**00:48:27** Then the microphone one is for cortex

**00:48:30** Like I've just found it like a thing this year to really try to streamline

**00:48:36** Oh if I have a random thought just add it to the cortex list and

**00:48:39** I use it enough that I thought oh it makes sense just to put on the dock

**00:48:43** So that's it like that's the entirety of my home screen a bunch of widgets and three input methods notes Omni focus and

**00:48:51** Cortex which is going to a reminders list and that's it

**00:48:54** Well speaking on behalf of cortex brand cortex brand is on

**00:48:58** Cortex the podcast will occupy one of three buttons your doc. Yeah occupying the most limited real estate

**00:49:06** All right. What's your home screen look like Mike? All right, so I have an image for you

**00:49:10** It's of my three home screens that are like my typical. These are what I use

**00:49:15** This is how I usually were on my phone when it's not in a focus mode and most of my focus modes

**00:49:21** I'm still pulling from this in some way

**00:49:23** So like I mentioned I had like a travel lock screen earlier

**00:49:27** The travel lock screen just takes over the first of these three lock screens

**00:49:31** And then I have the other two still enabled. It's just changing out one or the other right

**00:49:37** So I think a lot of this will be mostly unchanged from how it's been in past years to be honest

**00:49:43** So I don't know if there's much

**00:49:46** Excitement in here for you to pick apart, but who knows what you might find

**00:49:49** Yeah, I feel like this is pretty similar to last time

**00:49:52** You still got that fantastic wallpaper, which I always like which is from the hotel in California. Yeah, Beverly Hills Hotel, right?

**00:49:59** Okay, very fancy in the in the little diner down there, which I love I think it what is the cortex brand widget as craft

**00:50:04** That is craft. Okay, that's where I keep all my notes and I'm gonna talk about craft later on

**00:50:09** But that is like how I can quickly get into notes. I don't have to notice. I don't have the craft icon

**00:50:16** Anywhere on my home screens and this kind of serves duty of like one letting me launch the app quickly or

**00:50:24** Two there's like the four most recently used notes and they tend to be the ones that I need most

**00:50:30** Often like little things that I'm keeping track of or the current project that we're working on and then I can just jump into that

**00:50:35** Specific note very easily why activity as a like a gigantic widget on the third screen that seems like a strange business

**00:50:42** Yeah, yes. Yeah the I had a space available

**00:50:46** Sometimes I removed the fitness one if I have something that's like going on at a certain time

**00:50:52** Like when we were doing the st. Jude fundraiser, I had to like st. Jude fundraiser widget

**00:50:56** Ah, okay, and then otherwise I use fitness, but I do actually quite like the graphs that fitness

**00:51:03** Producers I was finding myself looking in the app on the phone quite a bit

**00:51:07** And so this was good to just get some of that information immediately

**00:51:12** Available to me because sometimes it's like oh

**00:51:14** I'm already at say like takes like 20 minutes 30 minutes of activity in my day when I haven't

**00:51:20** Worked out yet, and I'm like, where did that come from and sometimes just looking at the the time chart of exercise

**00:51:26** Will answer that for me, which is hmm

**00:51:30** It's like oh it recorded that walk that I did today

**00:51:33** Which sometimes it doesn't sometimes it does so like I just find that to be an interesting thing

**00:51:37** I like having it there and there's a couple of stacks going on

**00:51:41** Right, so there's carrot is underneath the fantastic how widget

**00:51:45** I have a shortcut widget which is for some time tracking stuff underneath the timer e widget and

**00:51:51** the widget Smith widget of

**00:51:54** The time zones that I have underneath that is a countdown timer, which is usually my next vacation

**00:52:01** And that like switches over on its own

**00:52:04** So if I have a vacation coming up up a countdown timer there

**00:52:07** Sometimes flip over and show me that instead of the time zone stuff. What are you using as the countdown app for that?

**00:52:12** It's also widget Smith. Oh, it's also widget Smith. Okay. Yeah, I think this is good

**00:52:16** I don't have anything to make fun of I feel you have a really solid system here

**00:52:18** So yeah, I think I think this is good and let's talk about the apps

**00:54:08** Trade comm slash cortex our thanks to trade coffee for their support of this show and all of relay FM

**00:54:14** So let's start with productivity apps. Yeah into the meat of state of the apps

**00:54:20** I read this into last year's episode and I'm noticing already a change in you because last year me

**00:54:26** Yeah, you would given up on to do and we spoke last year. You're like

**00:54:33** But already in this episode I've seen visual proof that you're using on the focus

**00:54:38** So it seems like you've gotten that part of your working life back in order again in 2022

**00:54:44** Okay. Yeah, so yeah last year must have been the nadir of my lockdown time

**00:54:51** Who needs it, you know what I mean? I

**00:54:54** Just do whatever the wind tells me

**00:54:58** Yes. Yeah, that was not a great period of time. No

**00:55:03** We can talk about part of that in a little bit of a later section

**00:55:07** but yes, I've gotten much better about being back in the habit of

**00:55:11** using Omni focus and I think part of it is I've

**00:55:17** Pulled out a subset of tasks which will not be going in Omni focus anymore

**00:55:23** They're gonna go somewhere else which we'll talk about later

**00:55:25** but it's I think this is a lot of times like you want to have real clarity about what are you using a thing for and

**00:55:33** I was trying to use Omni focus for something that just like never really was quite working and always put in a bit of a resistance

**00:55:38** And so now it's much more clear of like, okay

**00:55:42** I have

**00:55:43** reminders that are for how the day should be going and then there's like the specific kind of

**00:55:48** traditional to-do tasks of like oh

**00:55:51** You need to pay this bill on this day or whatever

**00:55:53** so I've got all that kind of stuff in there and then Omni focus is just working for me much better and

**00:55:59** For a couple of things I use shared reminders with my wife as I mentioned on the lock screen stuff earlier

**00:56:04** And that's basically it like I'm back using Omni focus. I'm very happy about it

**00:56:09** I am wondering what on earth is taking so long about the next version of Omni focus like I

**00:56:14** Think that they might be running into some trouble there

**00:56:17** But like for me looking around for apps

**00:56:20** It is still the same case of if an app does not have deferred dates

**00:56:25** It's just like a total deal breaker for me like I can't use it

**00:56:28** So I think reminders is a really interesting app

**00:56:31** Like I think it's gotten so much better over the years and it's another thing where they keep adding features

**00:56:37** And I could actually imagine being tempted by reminders in the future

**00:56:43** But until and if they ever add something that is like deferred dates

**00:56:47** It's just totally out of the picture for me

**00:56:49** So I'm back on Omni focus and I'm very happy about it

**00:56:52** I'm still using to-do list and I have kind of committed to myself that I'm not gonna change anymore

**00:56:57** No more changing no more switching goods. It's too disruptive and

**00:57:03** Ultimately not helpful for me, you know, like I remember I think during a WWE DC episode

**00:57:08** I was like, you know reminders. I think has everything that I want now

**00:57:11** I might move to reminders and I played around with it and it actually does like

**00:57:16** Reminders has I think at this point everything I would need that I use in to-do list because I'm trying still to use the system

**00:57:24** simply

**00:57:25** like for me, it's a task name and

**00:57:28** A due date and a project everything gets those that piece of information

**00:57:33** Sometimes I use some features that to-do list has but a lot of apps have like subtasks or adding little notes or comments to a task

**00:57:40** But I try to use the system simply in that way

**00:57:44** Which means that I kind of could use basically anything

**00:57:48** But at this point I have no desire and I'm kind of making a rule with myself to just stop moving around

**00:57:54** My only frustration with to-do list is nothing to do with them, which is how much stuff I have

**00:58:01** How much I'm putting in to my to-do manager

**00:58:04** But that feels more like a yearly themes problem than a state of the apps problem, right?

**00:58:08** Yeah, I have too much to do is not your to-do apps problem

**00:58:12** That's yeah, that's totally when I wrote that down

**00:58:15** I did feel like this is an interesting kind of app to make like a lot of these apps like to-do apps email apps

**00:58:21** Calendar apps because it is very easy for your customer base to be frustrated of you for reasons

**00:58:27** It's got nothing to do with you

**00:58:28** It's just like being in that application makes them angry because of the stuff that's in there or makes them sad because of how much is

**00:58:35** And like they take it out on the app, you know what I mean like oh, I hate to do us

**00:58:39** There's too much stuff in there all the time

**00:58:42** So it's like it's just like a funny little aside

**00:58:44** I came to as I was writing down like what do I like about to-do is what do I not like?

**00:58:47** Oh, I don't like how many things are in there. It's like what they didn't make that happen. I did that

**00:58:51** I resent my obligations. So I resent you

**00:58:55** But I'm I'm perfectly happy to do ist

**00:58:57** They continue to refine the app in ways that I like like they've been making some visual tweaks over the last year

**00:59:03** Nothing major but just like stuff that I think has made the app look a little cleaner

**00:59:09** One of the things that I will always love and this is like a thing for me of a lot of productivity apps

**00:59:14** where there's data entry involved natural language processing is incredibly important to me and

**00:59:20** You know this app and fantastic al which is like the king of this for me of their natural language stuff

**00:59:26** It's just so important when I'm sitting on my Mac

**00:59:28** I hit a keyboard command and just start writing what I'm looking to do

**00:59:32** I will hit for me

**00:59:34** It's a command option space and that will pop up on my Mac the to-do list quick entry

**00:59:39** And I will just start writing whatever the task is and I'll use you know, you learn the language for organization, right?

**00:59:46** So I can type in like do this task at 2 p.m. And it works that out

**00:59:51** but then if I want to add like into a

**00:59:54** Project then I will just hit the hash key and then start typing the name of the project and it will start doing

**00:59:59** Auto complete stuff for me, right?

**01:00:01** So you learn some little tricks nice with all of these natural language things

**01:00:04** But for me that is so valuable that I can just hit that and just go for it

**01:00:09** I wish there was something as simple on iOS

**01:00:12** But it's just as you have done and I have done in the past you can just set up a shortcut for these things

**01:00:17** But for me really the to-do list app is really easy to add stuff too

**01:00:21** So I just open the app and go for it

**01:00:24** But I really wish there was some way that I could do this in spotlight

**01:00:28** Say like, you know, like I just pull down spotlight and start typing

**01:00:32** Yeah, and there's some way that that can go into to-do list, you know

**01:00:36** I'm sure that there's something that it can do for reminders, but I don't want it to go into reminders

**01:00:40** You know what I mean? So I wish there was a way to do this

**01:00:43** I know you can kind of do it with Siri

**01:00:45** But I don't like the way you do it with Siri because you have to like say in to-do list

**01:00:50** I don't want to do that

**01:00:51** Like I don't want to add that information

**01:00:53** So with all of these things I would then just prefer to just open the app and do it

**01:00:56** But there's just nothing that is as easy as the way that I can add this stuff and I'm on my Mac

**01:01:01** Which is just with a couple of keyboard commands the Siri integration for other to-do apps like I'm glad it's there

**01:01:06** but I also don't use it because it's just annoying and I don't use the language natural language stuff in

**01:01:14** Fantastic al and I think that's also why in to-do is it's just never really appealed to me because it's not the way my brain works

**01:01:19** But I do like the closest I get to that which is why I also use reminders

**01:01:24** It's I feel like reminders is really great

**01:01:26** For like one-off things where I just have to go like oh, hey the next time I'm here remind me to do that

**01:01:33** Right tomorrow afternoon. I need to do this

**01:01:37** Then reminders is totally killer for that and it's like sure I could use Omni focus

**01:01:43** But that's where now the friction is in a different way and and reminders is just like

**01:01:49** So good for I casually need to be reminded to do a thing at a time or at a place or the next time

**01:01:57** I leave the house. That's like the best use for me of Siri and integrated tools

**01:02:03** But I'm guessing this sort of is answering a question that I was having which is when you say no more switching and you were

**01:02:08** Interested in reminders. I presume that the reason that you went with to do is is that natural language stuff?

**01:02:13** Like that's the thing that makes the difference for you for why you wouldn't use reminders. It always pulls me back

**01:02:17** It's the in my it's the best one at it, you know, most reminders has it

**01:02:22** I think Omni focus has it but it none of it is as good as the way to do is does it like to do

**01:02:26** It's just so good like we to do is you can set up really weird repeating

**01:02:32** Tasks it with natural language. I give me an example of that

**01:02:36** So like I could say remind me to take out the trash on the first Monday of every month

**01:02:41** That's pretty good that you could just type it like that and you can just say first Monday and it knows what that means

**01:02:48** And I've added tasks that way. Hmm. That's interesting. Yeah, I just had to do something in

**01:02:53** Omni focus which was the same thing where it's like, oh

**01:02:56** remind me if it was like remind me the third Monday of every October about a thing and

**01:03:03** It's like it's doable but it was like a bunch of clicks

**01:03:06** So it's interesting that you can do that kind of stuff just by typing it and to do is has an also was at a really

**01:03:10** Good help document which like details like these are the commands you can use to do some of this stuff

**01:03:16** so like sometimes it is easiest to do it with the text even than the UI and

**01:03:22** It also handles this stuff in a very graceful way, which I enjoy so I have some tasks that are like first Monday

**01:03:27** But if I move them

**01:03:30** to the next week

**01:03:33** When I then complete them it will go to the next first Monday

**01:03:38** I've used apps where like at that point I

**01:03:41** Don't I've used apps that have done this in the past

**01:03:44** I wish I could remember which but it's a long time ago now that like if you throw it off that schedule

**01:03:49** It just removes the repeating. Yeah, I've seen that I know what you're talking about. Yeah. Yeah

**01:03:53** I've seen that kind of thing happen where it's like you dared to disrupt this now you don't get to use it

**01:03:58** I'll show you yeah, yeah

**01:04:01** Is the kind of stuff where I then feel like I can't trust the system

**01:04:05** And if I feel like I can't trust the system then

**01:04:08** It's just too much of a weight on my brain that like I worried that like every complicated task

**01:04:13** I'm adding to the system is ultimately gonna let me down and this is never a way that I felt were to do it

**01:04:18** Like it is

**01:04:19** rock solid with this stuff and

**01:04:22** That's one of the things that has made me come back to it time and time again

**01:04:25** and now I am like no, I'm good I'm staying here this is the app that works the way that my brain works and

**01:04:33** Has literally never let me down in the way that some other apps have I am using reminders

**01:04:39** More now for shared lists, especially

**01:04:43** Mm-hmm. So very general stuff like grocery lists home project lists that kind of stuff

**01:04:50** Things that I don't really want in to do list which is by and large

**01:04:55** Work with some personal tasks, but personal tasks that tend to have some kind of like work relation to them if that makes sense

**01:05:02** Yeah, yeah, I get it

**01:05:03** But like the listen reminders that all shared at the moment or shared of adena

**01:05:07** So it's just stuff that we're working on together or you know things like that

**01:05:11** And I think reminders is pretty good for that because it's also most of these things. They don't have due dates

**01:05:17** They're just lists of things. Hmm and for me

**01:05:20** That can't work like for to-do list everything goes in with a due date

**01:05:24** That's how I work in to do this like I don't have tasks that don't have due dates

**01:05:28** so if I need to have a list of tasks or reminders that

**01:05:33** Won't have due dates. They need to go somewhere else through to work within the mental model of my system

**01:05:39** Right. So I've been using reminders for that and and it is really good

**01:05:42** like reminders has gotten really good and I think for for me it's going to become a

**01:05:46** You got a shared list to someone reminders where it goes

**01:05:50** Yeah, it feels like that has to be the default tool for that kind of thing. It's just the best at it

**01:05:55** It's the easiest at it in past years

**01:05:57** I've tried different things for little shared reminders and and ultimately it's like no no no just use reminders. It's so much better

**01:06:03** It's just baked into everything. It's yeah

**01:06:05** If you're using shared reminders with someone and it's not a reminders list

**01:06:08** I feel like you need a really good reason why you're not doing it this way when it comes to note-taking

**01:06:14** My systems have remained basically the same

**01:06:16** So Apple Notes is my central place for where I put all my personal notes

**01:06:23** Notes that are shared over people because again Apple Notes does a good job with that not very good at real time

**01:06:28** But good for like mostly asynchronous sharing like I'm gonna add something later on somebody else might add something

**01:06:34** You know that kind of thing which is fine. So before you go any further though

**01:06:37** What exactly do you mean by a note like like how would you define?

**01:06:42** I will not do this with you. I won't do this of you

**01:06:45** I mean like what is it I don't put like individual sentences like they are typically lists of the text

**01:06:54** Paragraphs of text I can't I can't do this

**01:06:58** Just I'm just asking like what kind of things are you saving a note?

**01:07:02** So

**01:07:06** The main things for me that go in like my most important notes are the individual

**01:07:11** Notes that I have for each of my shows so I have an upgrade follow-up note connected follow-up

**01:07:17** No cortex follow-up note, etc

**01:07:18** And in those notes goes links that I want to share like to talk about on a show

**01:07:24** So like I see something online

**01:07:25** I'll add it to that and one of the reasons I've always loved notes is how good the share extension is from anywhere in iOS

**01:07:31** To just add it if I have an idea for a topic

**01:07:34** I might start writing an outline in that note as well

**01:07:37** So there's like lots of things in each note in my cortex note

**01:07:40** I have like ideas for topics going back years that we've just not gotten to yet

**01:07:45** But they're all in there

**01:07:47** So I know that if I want to get some ideas for an episode of cortex

**01:07:50** I will go to my cortex follow-up note and it's all gonna be in there

**01:07:54** But I also have notes that are preparation for a show

**01:07:58** So when I was like got my iPhone 14 Pro, I was writing all of my thoughts in there for it

**01:08:02** So if I had to pull anything out for an episode I could do that

**01:08:05** So like me and Edina have in here like some notes for like our new home and like things that we want to keep an eye

**01:08:11** On like we have our all of the various pieces of information. We have a mast about how the house works

**01:08:18** Right like stuff that the previous owner said stuff that we worked out on our own

**01:08:23** You know like so all just going in there as like a central hub where we could search later on and it would bring us to that

**01:08:29** Note I have a note that I made called smart home, which has a bunch of things in it

**01:08:34** There's some what kind of products do I want to add to the home? Here's some links. Here's a

**01:08:40** photo of like kind of

**01:08:42** Flow chart that I drew on a piece of paper of like this is how I want the security system to work

**01:08:47** So it's all kinds of stuff goes in here

**01:08:50** but I think one of the things that makes me and you different is

**01:08:54** Related items are all within one note. They're not like multiple notes that are then drawn together by something

**01:09:00** Yes, I actually just realized something while you were talking again on notes and how people we go

**01:09:08** No, no, but I I'm gonna say this out loud because I never realized this was a feature

**01:09:13** But it just dawned on me why and how you could use this in the way that you're doing

**01:09:18** I never realized that if you're on a web page and

**01:09:22** You go to share that with notes that there's an option at the top to add it to a specific note

**01:09:28** So it will append at the bottom

**01:09:31** Six years

**01:09:37** No, no, but you've never like said it this way in

**01:09:42** Never realized this was a feature

**01:09:44** Yeah, so they know like so like you've always you've always talked about like having a cortex

**01:09:48** No, like I get it. But I just I think I always thought that the process of

**01:09:54** Adding like a link to the bottom of a page was more clunky than it actually was

**01:10:01** Yeah, I just had my mind blown

**01:10:02** Like I went into Safari and had shared with them and like oh at the top

**01:10:06** I can just pick something and it goes at the bottom

**01:10:08** I never knew that and then it does the little preview too

**01:10:12** Which I really enjoy and so like if somebody sends me a tweet and I add it by the share extension

**01:10:17** It gives me a preview of the tweet in notes

**01:10:19** So I don't even have to click the link right to know if it's something that I want for that episode

**01:10:24** so this is why like Apple Notes is is

**01:10:27** I'm this is such a part of my system for how I produce my shows

**01:10:32** I've tried other apps and other apps have really good features and they have like interesting things that they do which is like

**01:10:39** But none of them do

**01:10:41** This kind of like collecting of links like Apple Notes does yeah, it's like it's so ingrained in how I work now

**01:10:48** Yeah

**01:10:48** The way they do a little preview of whatever the link actually is is quite killer

**01:10:52** I could it's a really nice

**01:10:53** It's a really nice feature and I can see that it can make say

**01:10:57** scrolling a long list of

**01:10:59** Ideas for things to talk about on any of your podcasts much easier where you can also just visually see what it is

**01:11:04** Yeah

**01:11:04** I never knew and no one ever told me that you could append to the bottom of a note

**01:11:08** Like I just didn't realize that's quite interesting

**01:11:10** bullying

**01:11:15** This every year

**01:11:19** I don't think you have ever said the words like when you share it appends to the bottom of a note

**01:11:24** I don't think you've said that

**01:11:28** I'm also still using craft. I use craft for everything related to Cortex brand

**01:11:33** So it's a lot of the same kinds of stuff, but it's all siloed within craft

**01:11:38** You know, it's good for for me for brainstorming. It's good for mixed media. It's very good for sharing

**01:11:44** So if I have a note I can share it with someone it's usually I'll share it with you, right?

**01:11:48** Where I could be like hey look at this this table that I've got going on like of this information

**01:11:52** And it's very good like creating these links that you can show other people which I really enjoy

**01:11:58** One of the things that they've added in the last few months, which is awesome for me is calculations to tables

**01:12:05** So they added tables last year, but it was basically just you could draw a table and you could write in each box

**01:12:10** But now they've added functions and calculations that you can apply to what's in those tables

**01:12:15** Because one of the things that I use craft for is tracking sales for our products

**01:12:20** So I will go in every week and like write down what our current sales totals are and now craft will

**01:12:26** Automatically calculate how many have been sold in the last week based on our current total sales number

**01:12:32** And I like to have that it's just like an ongoing piece of information so I can kind of try and draw out some trends

**01:12:37** Over time before I was having to open peak out and do the calculations myself

**01:12:42** But now I have it all in craft

**01:12:44** So it's very easy now to me to do that the formulas

**01:12:48** Represented really nicely and I'm so happy that they added that because you know for a while

**01:12:53** I should I be doing this in numbers, but it's like but then it's breaking the idea of this stuff all being in crafts

**01:12:58** I was like going backwards and forwards and then they finally added this feature

**01:13:01** So it's given me the one little last piece that I was missing

**01:13:06** From my kind of craft setup for Cortex brand. That's really nice. I'm a big proponent of numbers

**01:13:11** I really like it as an app

**01:13:12** But it feels like it's too

**01:13:14** Heavyweight for like I just want to add up a list of numbers in this thing automatically

**01:13:18** So it's really nice that they added that you're still using obsidian, right? Oh

**01:13:23** Okay. No. Well look if we're talking if we're talking about notes

**01:13:29** Well

**01:13:32** What is a note like

**01:13:34** like I

**01:13:37** Feel like I don't I don't know when you I don't know when you want to talk about obsidian

**01:13:42** Obsidian to me is like a whole other universe of things. Yeah, I would say what most people mean when they're talking

**01:13:48** now

**01:13:49** I use the notes app as an individual list of things where it's like

**01:13:54** Oh, I just want to remember this and then every couple of weeks

**01:13:58** I just go through everything in notes and like sort it into some other place where it belongs or it just acts as a reminder

**01:14:03** So that you said earlier that you had a thing a button on your home screen that you compress

**01:14:09** Right, and it lets you add

**01:14:12** Something a thought that you have for for cortex. Where is that going? Okay, so currently it's going into reminders

**01:14:20** and the reason was

**01:14:22** I

**01:14:24** Why wouldn't it you know what I mean what is a note it's also a to-do

**01:14:30** I mean, can I explain myself like this?

**01:14:35** I first have to get out my emotions

**01:14:40** So this year for all of cortex I've been using reminders as my show notes and

**01:14:47** the reason I've been doing it that way is because

**01:14:50** Sure reminders is a reminders app

**01:14:53** But it's it's also kind of like the most simple possible version of an outliner app

**01:15:00** each item can be a little thing and you can drag them up and down and you have

**01:15:05** One level of sorting so you can have one little sub yeah

**01:15:09** And so when I add a little note for cortex

**01:15:13** it then shows up as like this individual line on my cortex list in reminders and

**01:15:19** I at the top just have a couple of categories so I've got like state of the app

**01:15:24** So as the year went along if I was using some clever little app that I knew like oh

**01:15:29** Six months from now when I'm not in Hawaii. I'm never gonna remember that I ever used this thing

**01:15:34** I can just make a note of that and then I like

**01:15:37** Folded under that one heading which is state of the apps and it's the same thing with the themes like oh

**01:15:42** I had a thought about themes

**01:15:43** I can just fold this under that one level of themes and it's nice because in reminders

**01:15:48** You can also toggle that little triangle to actually hide it so I don't actually see it

**01:15:53** so reminders for me has been kind of the perfect level of

**01:15:57** Organization for cortex notes for like the cortex show notes stuff

**01:16:01** And then it's also nice because when we go through the show I can just tick off

**01:16:06** Oh, these are the things that we've discussed and then they go away and the things that we haven't discussed

**01:16:12** Can stay on that list of oh like oh, maybe this makes sense in the future and I can throw that into another little folder

**01:16:19** Which is like possible future stuff. I actually really like this as a system for cortex. I

**01:16:25** Do want to trial next year

**01:16:28** Possibly doing this in obsidian instead for just like a couple of very small reasons

**01:16:33** But reminders has been working great for this like and I'm very happy with it as a system for

**01:16:38** Keeping track of stuff that I want to talk about in cortex and it's also just nice like it's a clear like here's this

**01:16:44** Individualist honestly my biggest problem with reminders is that for some?

**01:16:49** Incredibly annoying reason you can't like make the text bigger on the Mac app and it's infuriating like

**01:16:56** Sitting on my computer now. I'm like I want these words twice as big while I'm here recording the show

**01:17:01** But reminders is like oh no no

**01:17:03** No, we only want teeny tiny letters and teeny tiny sentences in our reminders app

**01:17:08** Which is genuinely like the thing that I find the most frustrating about it

**01:17:11** So that's where everything is going when I'm talking about cortex

**01:17:14** I can see how you got there

**01:17:16** Right and like the way that you're describing it that does make a lot of sense of like you have these pieces of information

**01:17:22** That are sure and you're just like adding to them

**01:17:25** but like the way that that wouldn't like work for me is I actually like to write in outlines and

**01:17:31** You can't do that right like you can add the initial thing, but if you want to add some context to it

**01:17:37** Reminders won't let you do that and so like that's what I do in the notes app, right?

**01:17:43** So like I'll open my cortex note and I might add a sentence and then later on

**01:17:47** I'm gonna come back and fill that out a little bit more in an outline format

**01:17:51** So I have more like thorough thinking and thorough notes for the show

**01:17:56** So I can see how you got there

**01:17:58** But it really does feel like you've established to me like an idea of how you want to track this information

**01:18:04** Give you somewhere to over time add this stuff, which I think is really good

**01:18:08** I wished that I would have thought that of that earlier for state of the apps especially

**01:18:13** Yeah

**01:18:14** I've had to do a lot of work over the last couple of weeks like combing through my

**01:18:17** Devices to find the apps that I like where I could have actually been adding them the whole time

**01:18:22** But yeah

**01:18:23** Reminders wouldn't work for me in this way because I then wouldn't be able to like do anything with that initial information

**01:18:30** Once it's in there in that application. I'd have to take it somewhere else

**01:18:33** Yeah, and that thing about being able to add sub layers like in an outline

**01:18:39** That is the main reason I've been thinking of maybe switching the system over to

**01:18:44** Obsidian which would allow me to do that more easily

**01:18:47** That is the main limitation of it is like but even if reminders had like just a

**01:18:53** Like a single additional layer like if it was a three layer hierarchy instead of a two layer hierarchy

**01:18:59** I might be totally fine with just using it like this forever because like one subheading is all I ever need

**01:19:04** For the Cortex notes whereas I do see in our Google Doc that you also often have like boom boom boom five sub layers

**01:19:10** Like here's all the things that I want to talk about with the thing. That's what my Cortex notes look like

**01:19:16** And just in a similar way. I think I mentioned it before but just in case I haven't I do also find reminders really great for

**01:19:24** To watch lists and to read lists so when someone recommends something

**01:19:28** I have a little shortcut that will add the book or the movie to the to watch list or the to read list and I

**01:19:34** Also, this is really key in the shortcut that I have set up to do that

**01:19:38** It also asks me who's recommending this and I always really like to be able to remember like oh this person

**01:19:46** Recommended me the show and so like the reminders has a like notes section. What are you what are you laughing at there Mike?

**01:19:54** This is how you keep track of all the bad recommendations. I give you well. I mean I mean look if I have been a knife said

**01:20:05** Listeners behind the scenes I have recently teased Mike is having one of the worst batting averages for recommending

**01:20:12** I

**01:20:15** Think have I saved myself a little bit with severance no severance was really good. Okay good

**01:20:20** So I've got one in the good column like I've got like there is an army of debt right in the bad column

**01:20:28** It's terrible back there. It's like the 300 back there, but it is terrible. It is terrible back there

**01:20:34** You did save yourself a little bit with severance especially because

**01:20:38** We'll just say severance have one of like the most

**01:20:41** stressful nail-biting hours of television I've ever watched in my life Wow

**01:20:51** Anything look no don't spoil anything for people right, but it's like I was literally sweating

**01:20:56** Like this and there's like that's amazing like it's amazing that it was able to do that so so yes Mike

**01:21:02** You've had a terrible batting average, but like wow is that a real peak that I would have totally missed otherwise

**01:21:07** I had hoped that severance would be the thing to save me

**01:21:12** Uh-huh, and like I knew it was like and I took a real sweet cuz you told me I believe when I recommended it

**01:21:18** Like if this one's bad, I'm done like that's the end

**01:21:23** Recommendations but like so I thought if anything is gonna save me on this one. It was severance. I'm pleased you enjoy

**01:21:29** Yeah, I mean listeners in your life

**01:21:31** You'll eventually find that some people become excellent anti recommenders that when they recommend something you're like, okay great

**01:21:37** This goes on the do not watch list and Mike was like I was just telling Mike like he's real close to getting

**01:21:46** You had you had some phrase at dinner where you're like I'm all in on severance like I met my entire reputation

**01:21:54** I did say that I said I will stake my I think you offered that as an option to me

**01:21:59** I'm like I will watch this if you stake your reputation on it, and I was willing to stake my reputation on the first on severance

**01:22:07** Yeah, it's a bit like you know you're the old West gambling hall, and it's like double or nothing right I got

**01:22:12** And you're like I'm all in but so yeah that worked out well

**01:22:16** But yes listeners

**01:22:17** That's why you want to keep a record of who recommended you to thing and so you can like

**01:22:22** Build up associations with who recommends what and also genuinely cuz I'm just like

**01:22:27** Super bad at keeping up with friends

**01:22:30** It's also nice that when you finish something it kind of gives you an excuse to be able to tell someone like oh hey

**01:22:36** I just finished this book that you recommended and

**01:22:39** Like I enjoyed it, and it's just like it can be a nice little

**01:22:42** Touchpoint as well didn't do that with severance you didn't you didn't text me and say that was great didn't I no I told you

**01:22:49** I know I updated you at some point that it was going well

**01:22:52** We spoke last week, and you said I'm enjoying it so far

**01:22:57** But we'll see how it goes to the end and this is the first I've heard

**01:23:03** Until now

**01:23:06** What speed you were on I mean look look we're getting on a bit of attention here

**01:23:10** But I do I do have a real asterisk of like I think they've written themselves in a real dangerous position for season two

**01:23:18** So we'll see but I'm still totally giving it to you as a win for I believe this isn't this isn't as well as right

**01:23:24** But I've I've read something if I'm remembering rightly

**01:23:27** that this was supposed to be one season and

**01:23:31** I think it was because Ben still is production company kind of made this happen. Which is like a fun thing

**01:23:38** Yeah

**01:23:38** I don't know why every time it like at the end of the episode it flashes like it ends and it goes to

**01:23:42** Custa black and it says like directed by Ben stiller. I don't know it just like made me laugh every yeah

**01:23:46** I feel a little bad about that

**01:23:49** But I was like oh Zula I remember when the first trailers came out because it was said that this show was happening

**01:23:54** It was like Ben stiller is direct and producing and it has Adam Scott from parks and rec

**01:24:00** And I was like okay, this is gonna be fun and then the first trailer came out and was like oh boy

**01:24:05** what is going on, but I believe it was supposed to be one season and

**01:24:11** The production company like Ben says the production company kind of realized what they had and they're like no

**01:24:15** This is gonna be more than one season and they they stretched out that final episode too

**01:24:21** But yes, I don't know what happens after this episode like I can't envision how it continues

**01:24:26** I'm really intrigued though because I love the first season so I can't wait for more now making more so if that's true

**01:24:33** That there was a coherent story which was turned into multiple seasons that gives me a lot more faith

**01:24:38** But yeah with with a lot of TV. It's like yeah, you can you can write something interesting and mysterious

**01:24:44** Yeah, but that's not the hard part like the hard part is closing the sale on your interesting and mysterious premise

**01:24:51** So yeah, I would say

**01:24:53** More understanding of the world at large like so they could just go in that direction

**01:24:57** I'm intrigued right because there's just like so much stuff

**01:24:59** Like I don't even understand how this this world is which is lost vibes you gave it lost vibes from it

**01:25:04** So I hope that they do a better job. I mentioned fantastic al earlier on as my calendar choice

**01:25:10** It's still the one for me. I will say though like

**01:25:14** Start to know it's a little janky ness of fantastic al oh, yeah, it's just a thing

**01:25:18** I've never noticed like never had before and

**01:25:21** And this is especially happening to me on the iPhone where the app seems to be haunted

**01:25:28** Sometimes oh we're like that sounds bad

**01:25:31** It's scrolling on its own in a way that I'm not asking it to do like I will say hit a date

**01:25:38** Right so like I'm looking at and I want to see up next Thursday

**01:25:41** And I tap it and I'm looking at it and then all of a sudden it jumps back to another day

**01:25:46** It was spooky or sometimes I'll like be scrolling and it will

**01:25:51** Say like all its you're on the 10th, but it's in on the little calendar view, but then on the list

**01:25:56** It's showing me like a different day

**01:25:58** Like I found this to be like a weird in the last little while it's like a thing

**01:26:02** I've not experienced with the app before it's always been really rock-solid

**01:26:05** But it's moving around the like the app seems to be moving on its own in a way that I don't like but

**01:26:10** Fantastic Cal still the best calendars like it's the way that I work natural language and all that kind of stuff

**01:26:16** And I love it, but you know bugs get into systems who knows this might be just me

**01:26:20** Maybe I'm the only one with a haunted fantastic al who could tell

**01:26:24** Yeah, I don't I never really use it on iOS

**01:26:27** I'm only ever using it on my computers

**01:26:29** And I can't report that I have any hauntedness in my fantastic al but yes like we mentioned it every year

**01:26:35** But I also like every year really feel the need to reemphasize like it is such a stupidly good calendar app

**01:26:40** Like you're going what you're crazy if you're not using it

**01:26:42** There's no better the thing that is just the amazing is like the calendar groups and being able to just say like okay

**01:26:47** Show me all the work stuff

**01:26:49** Show me all the stuff that I need to see if I'm planning traveling and social engagements or like it's it's just

**01:26:56** Unbelievably good so yeah, I can't I can't recommend fantastical well

**01:27:00** Are you using the calendar sets with focuses?

**01:27:05** No, I didn't know that was a feature

**01:27:07** But I also feel like that does not wildly matter for me

**01:27:12** That's a much more important feature for you, but can you do that tie that in with when the focus modes change?

**01:27:18** So there's a new features in your API called focus filters

**01:27:23** That apps can tie into and allow you to when you're in a certain focus mode only show you certain information

**01:27:30** So you can set this up that like when you're in a certain focus

**01:27:34** I message will only show you conversations from certain people and you can choose who you wanted to show you in

**01:27:40** Fantastic how you can have it show you in the app just certain calendar sets

**01:27:45** Timery has it that certain sets of timers will only be viewable to you in certain focus modes

**01:27:52** I haven't played around with that yet

**01:27:54** This is I don't do any of these I don't do it because it took a while for them

**01:27:59** And now I'm on there's only really apps that starting to happen now, but it's in the focus mode

**01:28:03** It's called focus filters and you can tap it and it gives you all of the apps that you know

**01:28:07** You might use that that will give you this functionality

**01:28:11** So you can configure a bunch of apps to show you certain information when you're in certain focuses

**01:28:16** I thought that could be interesting for you as someone who's running these focuses all the time

**01:28:20** But this isn't something that I have used myself

**01:28:23** I didn't I didn't realize that's where because I remember them talking about this and I I just always assumed this would show

**01:28:29** Up as a setting in the app, but it doesn't it's at the way bottom of

**01:28:35** The focus settings themselves. Yeah

**01:28:39** Interesting I did not know that ah, so that's where it shows you that you can pick stuff. Okay. I'll have to I'll have to take

**01:28:45** more of a safari tab group how intriguing yeah, so if you had like a

**01:28:51** Research tab group and a research focus mode time together

**01:28:55** Research like there's just gonna be one tab group under that that's that's madness

**01:29:03** My research to have group oh no my lights just switched again

**01:29:13** Not the only one with a ghost yeah, let me go back to chill mode, okay. All right, I will investigate that later

**01:29:19** But that's that's very cool. I didn't realize that and thank you for thank you for telling me where it actually is

**01:29:23** Cuz I might not have found it all year if you hadn't mentioned that and I'm gonna have a good piece of follow-up from last

**01:29:28** Year's stay at the apps that needs to be mentioned

**01:29:30** We spoke last time you said you were still using calzones by David Smith and oh, yeah

**01:29:35** Yeah, we both wished that he would just copy and paste calzones into widgets myth

**01:29:40** Which he has actually done in the intervening year. So we just Smith now has the time zone

**01:29:47** Functionality of calzones inside of it, which I love and so now this especially good for me which I enjoy

**01:29:54** I have the time zones widget on my lock screen, right when I tap that it opens widget Smith in the calzones view

**01:30:02** So I can move stuff around and see time zones over a scrolling period of time

**01:30:07** So very happy that that's in widgets myth now. Yes. Yeah, very happy about that. We wished

**01:30:14** bulleed and begged

**01:30:16** Underscored to put that into the app. And yes, he was very nice to do it and I really love it

**01:30:21** That's the only thing that I use on that

**01:30:23** I forget what they call it the today view

**01:30:25** I think is the language for it when you slide over to the left like I have that as a list there

**01:30:30** Which is just real handy to check and it was very satisfying to be able to switch because I think

**01:30:35** Calzones was the last thing that was using like this super old original widgets interface

**01:30:41** And it had to exist in like this janky bubble that felt like oh

**01:30:44** They must be running a virtual machine to run this widget on this system

**01:30:48** So it's real nice to be like ah, here's the updated one from calzones for anyone who does the time zone stuff

**01:30:54** Let me just reemphasize the killer feature of this and what makes it so good is not that it shows you the time in

**01:31:02** different cities, but that when you tap on it, it opens up this like

**01:31:07** Scrolly view so you can look at say like I've got six cities listed and you can scroll left and right and

**01:31:15** very easily see oh as the day moves on where I am

**01:31:19** What are all the times everywhere else and it's just like I've never found any interface that is as good

**01:31:26** For quickly figuring out when you're gonna do a call with someone in a different time zone. So it's not just the clocks

**01:31:32** It's what it opens up to and that's why we were like, please put calzones in the modern system

**01:31:37** And so it's great if you do time zones like you need to get this for sure

**01:31:41** I would just need to know because I checked this right four hours after we published last year's episode

**01:31:47** David sent us a video of him having added it into widgets myth four hours

**01:31:52** I believe he is the fastest developer in the West it took him longer before he actually put it in cuz he actually added a bunch

**01:31:59** Of stuff to widget smooth like a bunch of I think they're called tools in the app where it is now just like a lot more

**01:32:04** Functionality in the app that you can tie to some widgets that when you tap them they open up

**01:32:09** So there's like weather in there now. It's like a full weather app inside of it now as activity and step stuff. There's reminders

**01:32:16** Functionality, there's tons of new tools in the app. I will just note something where it took you

**01:32:22** Six months to respond to that message, which is hilarious. All right that did

**01:32:30** I

**01:32:32** Listeners that is evidence when I say when you hear me say things like I am bad at getting back to people

**01:32:38** That's the kind of thing that I mean is like

**01:32:41** A message is sent and half a year later. I respond like i'm i'm

**01:32:47** I am not proud of this

**01:32:49** I don't wish that I was this way like if I could wish myself better than this I would be better than this but like

**01:32:56** Sometimes you have to live with the person that you are and yeah

**01:32:59** That's that's real bad. And I wish I could say that was some kind of crazy outlier, but it is

**01:33:06** Not

**01:33:07** Hey, look, this is one of those things if everyone's true friends, you understand each other, right?

**01:33:11** And like yes people that are friends of you

**01:33:13** They know that you're this way and it's like this is you know, we all work together make each other better

**01:33:18** So time management, let's talk about

**01:33:21** Let's talk about time management

**01:33:23** Gotta talk about timer as well because like since last year timer has had so many awesome new features added to it

**01:33:29** A few things that i'm really loving about timer. I'm loving using it on my mac

**01:33:34** Loving the menu bar app that I have running right now

**01:33:37** And it's the way that I most frequently set timers now is from the menu bar and like what I really love

**01:33:43** Is there's a recent time entries in the menu bar, which is the way that I most frequently will start a timer

**01:33:49** So I just go down to recent time entries

**01:33:51** You should like ever saw that the last week's worth of stuff is in here for me if I want to do show prep

**01:33:56** I usually go to recent time entries and it doesn't take me very long to be like oh show prep for cortex

**01:34:01** And i'll hit it and it'll just start the timer and you can also do some very basic things in there

**01:34:06** Like you can change the start time by five or fifteen minutes as I can edit parameter stuff

**01:34:11** This is a great menu bar app and it's how I use time most now

**01:34:15** But one of the other things that I love that joe added to the app now is just like an auto completing

**01:34:20** So you when you start a timer you can have it because again, I love working in text for these things

**01:34:25** You can just drop your cursor into like a description field which you can start typing so I could start typing like cor

**01:34:32** For cortex and it will show me my recent timers for cortex

**01:34:37** It's an easy way to then just hit the one that i'm looking for

**01:34:40** It's like an auto complete and just hit enter. So that's really awesome

**01:34:43** It got lock screen widgets, obviously which we're using the focus filter stuff that I mentioned is in there

**01:34:49** And the live activities which we haven't spoken about yet

**01:34:51** But it's the new thing in ios that works particularly good with the always on display and the dynamic island on the 14 pro

**01:35:00** So now when i'm running a timer on my iphone, it's just always ticking away and I love it

**01:35:05** I love this feature so much. I think that it's such a great addition for timery. You're talking about loving the

**01:35:11** It is called the live activity

**01:35:12** That's the one on the bottom where it just shows you here's the name and here's the timer live activities and the dynamic island

**01:35:17** Thing are the same thing. They're all live activities. Okay

**01:35:21** So this is what I was wondering because I was I was digging around when the the new app came out

**01:35:25** And I got the new phone with the dynamic island

**01:35:28** I thought it was interesting like everything in here is under one setting. I wonder if behind the scenes

**01:35:33** Apple doesn't distinguish between the dynamic island and the live activity stuff if it's all just the same

**01:35:39** So I guess that sounds like that is the case. Okay, that's interesting. Everything that happens in the dynamic island

**01:35:44** Is a part of the live activities api?

**01:35:47** Uh, okay

**01:35:48** So I should think about it the other way live at like dynamic island is a subset of live activities in a way

**01:35:53** Okay, it's one of the two or three places on your iphone that you will see a current live activity

**01:35:59** Right because you can get it in the lock screen

**01:36:01** You can get it in notifications which are essentially the same thing

**01:36:03** But there's two ways to get to it and then it's also in the dynamic island that makes sense

**01:36:07** I was uh as I could offer be I was I was like quick on the draw for emailing the developer and be like

**01:36:12** Hey, I want these as different settings

**01:36:14** But the more I looked at I was like maybe that's not his choice, right?

**01:36:17** Maybe this is the way apple's just done it behind the scenes

**01:36:20** I have to see I have to get used to it a little bit

**01:36:22** I don't love having the big live activity thing on my lock screen with the always on display

**01:36:28** The always on display is interesting. I think it's a bit of a double-edged sword

**01:36:31** I mostly like it, but there are clearly cases where I don't and this is kind of one of them

**01:36:36** But it is why like you were mentioning the little menu bar for timer e and that to me is

**01:36:41** Killer like I absolutely love that

**01:36:44** And I don't use it

**01:36:46** But I love just having that it can show the icon in the color of whatever timer you're running

**01:36:53** And I also just turn off the time display like I don't want to see how much time has passed

**01:36:59** But it's great while i'm working to just have a quick visual indicator that like yes, the correct timer is running right now

**01:37:06** Uh, I just like absolutely love that. Um, it's just like on my phone

**01:37:11** I think I might turn off some of that live activity stuff because I find it too prominent and too distracting

**01:37:16** But the menu bar one is like perfect. That's what I want

**01:37:19** I just want a quick visual indicator because I run everything from spotlight is how I like turn on and off timers with a

**01:37:25** janky system that involves automator running a terminal command to run a shortcut, but it works for me

**01:37:32** And then I can just quickly see like oh the color changed great like the correct timer is running

**01:37:36** I'm on a break now or i've switched from core work to admin work in the timer settings. There is a live activities set of

**01:37:43** settings

**01:37:45** And there are some options like showing the duration you can turn off so it would still show that there's a timer running

**01:37:51** But yeah, those systems are very interlinked of each other

**01:37:54** You're always on live activity and the dynamic island you kind of can't choose one or the other

**01:38:00** You have to just choose if you want to run live activities at all

**01:38:04** Yeah, and and that's why I ended up not like having a request about hey, can we change this because I thought uh,

**01:38:09** this probably does make sense

**01:38:11** that apple wants to just

**01:38:14** Consider the concept of there's something happening now and we will choose how it's displayed

**01:38:20** Depending on what the user is doing on their phone. These are not separate systems

**01:38:24** Yeah, I think it's great for people that it exists and it is when I run timers on the phone

**01:38:29** Weirdly satisfying on that little island on the top to see the little timer pop up and like the whole

**01:38:35** Shortcut system work like it's it's really good and I like that visual confirmation of like yes the timer went through

**01:38:41** It's running right now. You can see that there's a little circle at the top

**01:40:44** Are you still using notion at gray industries?

**01:40:47** notion

**01:40:49** well notion nation

**01:40:52** Yeah

**01:40:53** Yes, i'm still using notion. I say it like that because this is one of these things where

**01:40:59** I personally still don't love

**01:41:02** Notion there's just something about the interface that still really gets me and there's also something where I find it like weirdly hard to find stuff

**01:41:10** Sometimes I don't love their search like I could have an endless list of complaints about notion

**01:41:17** while at the same time realizing that this year

**01:41:21** It really cemented itself as one of these but how did I ever live before we use this tool?

**01:41:28** Kind of apps in terms of project management stuff

**01:41:32** like it's just been growing over the years for a lot of the behind the scenes stuff in terms of admin and

**01:41:40** This year in particular with a couple of projects

**01:41:43** One of which has been frustrating me for like three quarters of the year now, which I was uh,

**01:41:49** Complaining to mike about a little bit

**01:41:52** A project where it's like fact checking stuff that's going back 150 years between me and my assistant

**01:41:58** And fact checker like working together

**01:42:00** It would just not be possible to do the current project that we're working on without something like notion to keep track of everything

**01:42:07** So yeah while I have an endless list of complaints about it

**01:42:10** It's like it's created in my brain a sort of

**01:42:14** new category for

**01:42:18** Basic tools that any team needs

**01:42:23** Like you need something like slack for everybody to talk to each other

**01:42:26** You need whatever your industry specific tools are and you need something like notion

**01:42:33** Which is kind of like a database of shared knowledge

**01:42:38** That's way more ad hoc and flexible than something like

**01:42:44** Google docs which might be a lot of people's first port of call for something like this

**01:42:49** It's where a lot of stuff for relay is google docs

**01:42:51** Yeah, and sort of how you're mentioning with craft like it added a feature where there's tables

**01:42:57** One of the things that's just really killer for notion just to like express to people like how do we use this?

**01:43:02** Is for fact checking a script and putting together a timeline of events

**01:43:09** It's like I can give the the script to the fact checkers

**01:43:12** They break it down into like here's all of the statements that are made in this script

**01:43:17** But that can then go into a table

**01:43:20** It's like sort of like an excel table, but not as rigid and each fact can be categorized as like oh, we've cleared this

**01:43:26** This is good

**01:43:27** This has further questions or like this totally needs to be flagged and we need to double check it

**01:43:32** And it's super useful on my end because then I can then like sort all of these like show me the critical ones

**01:43:38** so i'm going to work through these first and

**01:43:41** What's nice about it is then each little fact if my assistant or the fact checker have set it up this way

**01:43:47** I can click on that fact

**01:43:49** And then it basically opens up like a whole new document that can be all of the details about what's going on here

**01:43:55** like it doesn't need to be squeezed into the table and if necessary like

**01:44:01** That sub page can link to another page as well related to this. So

**01:44:06** It's really just been the best sort of tool that allows a team to go in depth on a bunch of stuff

**01:44:14** I know why

**01:44:15** That is useful and I know why people like the way that notion works like this where it's like things are like

**01:44:22** Infinitely expandable right where you can just keep clicking on things and opening new pages. I can't stand that

**01:44:29** way of working

**01:44:31** Because for me it's like I never know how far down this is gonna go

**01:44:37** And I don't like that where like I see this piece of information. Is there like a whole?

**01:44:42** 25 level stack of notes behind this like I don't know until I start clicking

**01:44:48** For me that just does not work. I don't like the uncertainty

**01:44:52** In a system like that. I get why

**01:44:55** People do I get why especially for the way you just described that

**01:45:00** 100 see how that is incredibly helpful to you right of like there is just a table

**01:45:06** But that table can hold within it an infinite amount of information

**01:45:10** Which definitely makes sense for us what you're talking about fact checking, right? Like here's a fact

**01:45:15** But like here's all the research that led to us saying that this fact is true

**01:45:20** Right, like I've 100 see how that helpful for you. It's like hell for me

**01:45:24** Also on there what is surprisingly useful is sort of like you talk about

**01:45:28** What is it spark that lets you do those comment threads on an email?

**01:45:32** Notion has that same sort of thing where there's there's a like here's the fact here's all the information about the fact

**01:45:38** And then also here's the sidebar conversation

**01:45:41** so I can add someone and like ask for clarification about a thing and

**01:45:46** it's just so useful and

**01:45:48** It's really great to have like clearly have that understood of like we pull this out of slack

**01:45:55** There is the little this is this is where like my frustrations are the same frustrations you have

**01:46:01** That there there can be a little bit of a like where the hell am I?

**01:46:05** right, like i'm in i'm in the middle of

**01:46:08** Some kind of weird loading for the matrix and it could be anything

**01:46:12** And it's it still always blows my mind if i'm just typing something and it's like oh, hey

**01:46:16** Do you want to insert a database query here? Like no, I don't I was just trying to send a message where i'm asking a question

**01:46:21** But like a fool I hit the slash button and opened up a portal into everything that could be possible

**01:46:28** I think what is also key with notion is that you do have to have

**01:46:34** someone who is canonically in charge of the order of this thing and everybody else just has to deal with it

**01:46:40** And for me, that's my assistant. It's like she's in charge of canonically what this order is

**01:46:46** Nobody else gets to rearrange pages

**01:46:49** Because if you have like everybody do that it can totally be a disaster

**01:46:53** So it's it's like I work within this system that she is overseeing that several people use

**01:46:59** The other place that we use it for which has turned out to be really great as well is

**01:47:03** Notes for me to the animator every time we go through a work in progress release

**01:47:08** So like every time a video is rendered

**01:47:10** I then go through and like leave all of the notes for changes that need to be made

**01:47:15** And it's the same thing of like it's great because we can have a little conversation in here about like what did you actually mean?

**01:47:21** About this or I can just like put in a screenshot and it creates this long list. So

**01:47:26** Yeah, I think i've really

**01:47:29** Settled on this is a category of tool that's totally necessary

**01:47:34** There's things I don't like about it

**01:47:35** But i'm just i'm never going to think again about like oh, maybe instead of notion

**01:47:39** I could get everybody to use my insane obsidian system like no, no

**01:47:43** That's not how this is going to work. Like notion is obviously the best tool for this

**01:47:47** There is a designated person who's in charge of all it, which is totally necessary. Yep, and it actually is

**01:47:54** Great the visual nature of it will appeal to way more people. Oh, yeah

**01:47:58** Yeah, and genuinely like it has a ton of features that obsidian never really could

**01:48:03** Replicate in the same way that are just better for what it is trying to do

**01:48:08** So yeah, I highly recommend notion despite all of my frustrations and i'm really glad that it exists and

**01:48:16** Particularly for a thing that we're working on this year. It feels like without this

**01:48:21** tool the

**01:48:23** Scale of fact checking would just simply not be possible

**01:48:28** And like the tiffany project was the first time I saw oh that where this is this is useful

**01:48:34** For everyone to try to coordinate and like it's really proved itself again. So two thumbs up from notion

**01:48:40** It's great. Every team needs something like this the moment you're working on something non-trivial

**01:48:46** That's separate from the slack where you're doing more day-to-day communications

**01:48:51** Yeah, some of this stuff spread out the relay fm quite a bit where you know

**01:48:54** We have a lot of pieces of shared information in various google docs because like when we started our company notion didn't exist

**01:49:00** None of these tools existed when relay fm started

**01:49:04** well

**01:49:05** Yeah, as we record today actually which is the 10th of november i've been self-employed for eight years. Oh, wow

**01:49:13** Congratulations. It's it's my anniversary of being self-employed happy anniversary. Thank you so much

**01:49:18** We have still been using air table for some sales stuff

**01:49:23** But i'm not sure it's long for this world for us. Like we keep

**01:49:27** outgrowing these systems

**01:49:29** And carrie our vps sales has been trying to sell me on a new one that she wants to use

**01:49:35** So we're going to try that out for a little bit

**01:49:37** So i might talk about that next year

**01:49:39** This stuff is so particular to the people that use it and it's just it's not scaling with us in ways that we want it

**01:49:45** To but we continue to use and have used forever google sheets. It's like a really good way of

**01:49:52** Keeping revenue stuff how much money is going through the company on a monthly basis and like it's just easy

**01:49:59** To do calculations and share them with a bunch of people

**01:50:02** And it's rock solid works everywhere

**01:50:04** We've used google sheets since the inception of the company and like I

**01:50:09** Outside of us building our own tools completely. I can't imagine moving away from google sheets

**01:50:14** But like that is a secondary thing that we've been thinking about like we have some like a web app for tracking advertising stuff

**01:50:22** Which we've been building on to

**01:50:24** And it is a possibility that in the future we build enough functionality into that that we get rid of all of these

**01:50:29** Sales tools and we just use that one

**01:50:32** Because then it just works exactly the way that we want it to but we'll see but for now

**01:50:36** You're tracking all that stuff in google sheets. Is that what you're saying? Mostly google sheets

**01:50:40** Yeah, it also runs as like a secondary backup to our own tools. So we have like somewhere to check that information again

**01:50:47** So I'll give you like some examples. So when we have a contract

**01:50:51** We have two google sheets that we book it into one

**01:50:54** Which is like here's how much that contract is worth on a monthly basis broken down

**01:50:59** And then a second google sheet, which is like a kind of a calendar of all of our shows

**01:51:04** We book in like spots right for like these are the sponsor spots. They go into that calendar, right?

**01:51:09** We then have other systems that refer to this information. So

**01:51:15** We have our own sales system

**01:51:17** Where all of our hosts get their ad copy and they see where the ads are booked

**01:51:21** That is based on that original google sheet which has all of the month by month breakdown, right?

**01:51:27** So like we have a contract the contract information goes here and then it's replicated somewhere else. So we then have these three

**01:51:34** places of information

**01:51:36** Which allows for making sure there are no mistakes because we can check against all of this stuff

**01:51:41** We also have fresh books where we send our invoices from fresh books is also pulling from

**01:51:47** Two places when we send out an invoice

**01:51:49** We're checking against our own sales tool and against the google sheet which has got the monthly listing of all of the ad spots

**01:51:56** So like the value of them all so every time something's going into a system

**01:52:01** There's two other places that it could be checked from

**01:52:03** and we do this as like a way to make sure things aren't getting missed and that

**01:52:08** Calculations are correct and that everyone's got the ads that they need and so there's always these like three things

**01:52:14** So that's like my concern of like if we built our own tools

**01:52:17** Well, that's removing one of the three, but we'll see it's how we've worked forever

**01:52:22** And so now we're kind of like it's got this like church and state separation vibe to it

**01:52:27** Like the information lives in multiple places, which means that if there's a mistake made we can find

**01:52:34** The truth which is very valuable

**01:52:36** Right. So like if an ad spot is missed or put somewhere wrong or the value is incorrect

**01:52:42** The fact that we have multiple places where this information exists means we can find the answer

**01:52:47** And we always do I feel like i'll take your word that that works for relay which it obviously does

**01:52:52** I just always feel like

**01:52:54** in general information

**01:52:57** Being redundant in multiple places is a bad sign

**01:53:01** Like that's not how things should work

**01:53:04** Like i've never I say it people like you're just duplicating work

**01:53:07** But what I do know is i've had problems that i've fixed that I don't know how I would fix if we didn't have that

**01:53:13** Information in one of a place. Well, I mean like wouldn't you use github right?

**01:53:17** And it will after people have pushed push and fork push to commit the tree

**01:53:22** You can go back and and see where things went wrong. So you'd use these kits. You can see the rings of the tree

**01:53:28** I think that's how it works

**01:53:31** So talking about like team stuff I need to talk about my email app

**01:53:37** Okay

**01:53:38** So I use spark. I use spark as my email app because of its team sharing functionality

**01:53:44** spark recently unveiled a big

**01:53:47** Overhaul of the app. Uh, oh the biggest changes are on the desktop app. They have a new desktop app

**01:53:53** So they're old apps spark twos that exist, but it got spark three

**01:53:58** But when a service does something like this

**01:54:00** I want to try out the new one immediately because it's going to change stuff and plus even though the new app only

**01:54:06** Exists on the mac they've made changes to the old app which they need to make so it works with the new app

**01:54:12** So the phone while the phone app looks the same it operates in some slightly different ways

**01:54:19** They've added a bunch of features some i've been using it for since it came out. It's like a month or so ago now

**01:54:26** Some i've gotten used to and a good but some are bad and a bad in like

**01:54:31** Fundamental ways of like this isn't badly architected. I think you're just your whole idea is poor

**01:54:38** So we tell you some good stuff that they added right two things that I really like

**01:54:43** They are doing automatic categorization of email. So like newsletters notifications and people

**01:54:51** It's pretty good at like when an email comes in of putting it into one of these three categories

**01:54:56** And what I like about this is it is doing it for all of my email accounts that I have in the app, right?

**01:55:02** It's not doing them per account or whatever like that

**01:55:04** And it's relatively simple to move one to the other easier on the mac than it is on

**01:55:09** The phone to do this right now, but it's possible to do

**01:55:12** It's also doing blocking of senders

**01:55:13** So someone sends me an email and I can block them and or I can block the entire domain from emailing me again

**01:55:20** This is very good at dealing with some of the issues that I've spoken about in the past of like the pr emails that I get

**01:55:26** Right, right. So now I no longer see the hey just checking in on this a week later because that person is now blocked

**01:55:32** I don't see them anymore. So they're the good

**01:55:35** Now we get to the bad

**01:55:36** This is one that I think you will find as frustrating as me

**01:55:41** You no longer archive an email

**01:55:45** You done an email

**01:55:47** What what does that mean? So you mark an email as done

**01:55:52** Okay, and it goes to the done folder

**01:55:56** And then if you want to put an email back in your inbox

**01:56:00** You mark it as not done

**01:56:02** How is this different from archive versus inbox? Oh it isn't. Oh, it's just a new metaphor

**01:56:09** For no reason. Yeah, for some reason spark feel like they need to change

**01:56:14** This word they're like branding the concept of archiving a message

**01:56:19** That feels a little bit like so you mark an email is done

**01:56:23** Or not done and then they actually now have changed the done section to say archive

**01:56:30** But it's got the tick next to it that the rest of the app has

**01:56:33** So like they haven't even fully committed anymore to the whole idea of done and not done

**01:56:39** Okay that I don't like a lot of my issues with the app is that they have this like

**01:56:44** Opinion about how I should be doing my email with like by default the app has a home screen on the mac, right?

**01:56:52** Which you can turn off

**01:56:54** But the home screen is like as you can imagine like here's a field

**01:56:57** How are you doing today?

**01:56:59** And by default they want you to only have access to your inbox a couple of times a day

**01:57:05** No, no, I don't need an app to tell me how to do email

**01:57:11** I will tell the app how I want to do my email, right? Like you don't need to save me from email

**01:57:16** It is what it is. Like I don't need you to impose your ideas on me

**01:57:21** Like this kind of stuff I find so frustrating where like people always talk about opinionated software

**01:57:27** This is something we do not need to have an opinion about email, right?

**01:57:30** Like it is set the ways we use it are set you are not going to change it

**01:57:35** So I couldn't you're not going to either right like this is not going to sell more subscriptions for you

**01:57:41** Like this is their thing. They've now moved like the app is fully subscription

**01:57:44** I've been paying for the team functionality for a long time and now they've moved to a subscription model, which is fine

**01:57:50** I think right but like they have rushed out I think a new version of their application

**01:57:56** To change their business model to subscription because like the mac app especially is janky in a ton of ways

**01:58:04** As of recording now, there is no column view. Everything is all in one window. So you want to look at an email?

**01:58:10** Right. So oh I was like, how would you oh, no, that's awful

**01:58:15** It's like the photos app like you click on an email and then and now it's full

**01:58:19** If you want to reply to the email it like pops up in a tiny little box in the bottom right hand corner

**01:58:25** Now they're saying they're going to add column view, but they shipped a version of their app with no column

**01:58:29** Why was column view ever taken out of an email app? That's crazy

**01:58:33** Well, okay great part of the reason is they've moved it to electron which I don't care about

**01:58:38** But they've done this so they can be on windows, which I think is a perfectly valid reason to do this architecture change

**01:58:44** But if you're going to do this architecture change don't take away

**01:58:47** Things like column view

**01:58:49** Right. It's like madness to me like I cannot look at my inbox and emails in the same place

**01:58:55** Like I even look at my inbox or I look at an email and nothing else changes currently

**01:59:00** There's no printing in the application. You cannot print an email. That's weird

**01:59:04** Which for me, you must say why would you want to do that?

**01:59:06** I get a lot of invoices right like receipts and even for my account

**01:59:10** So I print them as a pdf save them to a dropbox folder and they go to the accounting software that I use

**01:59:16** I can't do that on the mac version anymore. I have to go to the ios version

**01:59:20** And actually in general there's a lot of like weird jankiness

**01:59:23** But like this whole like opinionated thing. I just don't need it

**01:59:27** You don't need to do this for me like I can work on my own with my email

**01:59:32** like i've been using it for a long enough time and like I started looking at some other apps and

**01:59:37** I've learned to live with the weirdness of it and they have been making changes like when it shipped

**01:59:41** It had no dark mode, but they've added the dark mode in

**01:59:44** I think that they're making some mistakes about trying to tell me

**01:59:48** how I should use email and I just find this whole idea of like

**01:59:53** Done rather than archive to just be kind of insulting in a way. You're not having a big grand vision here

**01:59:59** You're just changing a word and it's completely pointless when the effect is the same

**02:00:05** Ultimately i've learned to live with some of the strangeness and i'm putting my faith in them to fix the broken things

**02:00:11** I don't think they're going to fix the ideology stuff and i'll see how that

**02:00:16** Probably continues to make the app weirder in the future

**02:00:19** Right, like they've said that they're going to have a brand new design for the iphone app in the future and that might break me

**02:00:26** If they continue to make that as weird as they've made the mac app in a bunch of ways

**02:00:31** But what keeps me here is how good the team sharing is?

**02:00:34** I don't know what my future is for email but spark has like

**02:00:38** Gone from this stasis for me to a question mark now

**02:00:41** Because I think that they might be starting to go in a direction that does not align for me

**02:00:46** Which is I use your app as a team focused email communication tool. I do not use it as a

**02:00:53** Let's fix email tool

**02:00:56** Email's broken. You're never going to fix it

**02:00:59** Stop trying. Yeah, it sounds like they're trying to move to a emails as to-do items metaphor

**02:01:07** Kind of even then they're not doing that, right

**02:01:10** Like if that's what they're going to do, then let me do a bunch of stuff with it, right?

**02:01:15** Let me set due dates or whatever. Let me set a date on something rather than snooze

**02:01:19** Let me say why not let me rearrange them like I could in mailbox

**02:01:22** Which is something I last for forever. Like if you're going to go down that route

**02:01:26** Like make it work more like a to-do app, but they're not doing any of that

**02:01:31** It's just the button that used to be archive is now called done and they've moved it into another part of the application

**02:01:37** like visually and changed the iconography for it. That's very frustrating when something that's core and

**02:01:44** And is perfectly fine. Does a major change like

**02:01:48** I think I think we all know the dread when you see an app you use be like hey

**02:01:53** We've done a major read is like oh no

**02:01:56** Why is this almost always worse? This is so much rarely better

**02:02:00** Like if I wasn't using the team stuff

**02:02:03** I would have moved to apple's mail app just so I could have some consistency in my life

**02:02:07** Right

**02:02:07** Well, I was going to ask like what's your fallback if you have to move out of this because like that that team stuff has

**02:02:14** Seemed really critical to your workflow for years

**02:02:17** So i'm just like i'm wondering like what even is the next option?

**02:02:21** There are other apps that exist. Um, I use an app called missive for a couple of days

**02:02:26** And it's just got its own set of things that I really don't like one of the biggest ones for me is the notifications

**02:02:32** I like that if I get an email notification, I can archive the email from the notification

**02:02:36** You can't do that in missive. They just haven't added that functionality

**02:02:40** Which is not a big thing, but it's something that I do a lot and that bugged me

**02:02:44** There's a lot of little things in the application which were like

**02:02:47** This isn't the way that I do them. Maybe I could get used to it, but I don't know

**02:02:51** So that one lives out there is like here's another one that is come recommended from people

**02:02:56** Of like this is an app that does like team communication stuff

**02:03:02** I mean honestly

**02:03:04** if

**02:03:05** spark like goes away

**02:03:08** Then i'm gonna have to read do the way that I work with email completely

**02:03:13** And I don't know what that's going to be yet

**02:03:15** Probably going to have to go back to working in the really inefficient way of referencing emails in slack chats

**02:03:21** Oof which I really don't want to do feels like barbaric compared to what you were doing. Yeah, that feels awful. So I don't I don't really know

**02:03:29** What I will do and it's why I will hang on

**02:03:32** For way longer than I would normally to

**02:03:36** Spark like I said if I was a spark user without any of the team stuff this change that they made I would have left

**02:03:43** Because it's just like I just don't like the direction the app is going in and that's never a good feeling

**02:03:49** Because i'm also getting at the moment this sense of desperation

**02:03:52** Yeah for a business model change and that also never feels good

**02:03:56** Because I feel like they shipped this version of the app sooner than they should have

**02:04:01** And I feel like they only shipped it so they could have subscriptions for everyone

**02:04:06** And that makes me nervous because they didn't wait until the app was ready to ship it and change their business model. Oh, so you

**02:04:13** You're right. Okay. So what you're worried

**02:04:16** There's like just like a purely a revenue problem is the reason that they shipped too soon. Uh-huh

**02:04:22** They have a brand new version of the app

**02:04:25** Only on one platform, right?

**02:04:27** That is where they're saying is coming to every platform

**02:04:31** And they've made architectural changes to the other apps. So they work together with the new version

**02:04:38** And the new version is missing a bunch of really simple features

**02:04:44** And they're also keeping the old mac app around because they know this but they did this so they could say here's our new subscription pricing

**02:04:52** For the app

**02:04:54** so that that whole thing

**02:04:56** Makes me nervous

**02:04:57** As well as the fact of like I just don't agree with some of the decisions that they're making

**02:05:03** So i'm just gonna stick around for now, but I don't I

**02:05:07** I feel like now compared to every other year

**02:05:10** i'm like

**02:05:12** Maybe i've got one foot out the door here, but I don't know where that's two

**02:05:17** So

**02:05:19** This episode of quadtext is brought to you by fitbot

**02:05:21** Fitbot is the app that is going to learn about you

**02:05:24** Your goals your training ability and craft a personalized exercise plan to meet your needs

**02:05:29** They have a fantastic app that makes it so easy to learn how to perform all of their exercises

**02:05:35** No matter how often you're working out fitbot will make sure that they track your muscle recovery

**02:05:40** They make sure that the plan that they develop for you, which is available in their awesome app is balanced of a variety of exercises

**02:05:46** You're never going to be overworking anything. You're never going to be underworking anything fitbot knows how to get it done

**02:05:52** They have hd video tutorials. They're shot from multiple angles

**02:05:55** They're going to make sure that learning every single exercise is a breeze for you

**02:05:58** They integrate with apple watch where I wear smartwatch apps like strava fitbit and apple health

**02:06:03** I was thinking about this the other day as I was actually working out at the time

**02:06:07** How much fitbot has really changed my life in the last year?

**02:06:11** Because it set me on a path to understanding more about what I value in fitness

**02:06:15** And what I learned is it's exactly what I talk about in every single one of these ads

**02:06:19** Is that you don't want to have to compete with other people for personal fitness?

**02:06:23** It should be something that is unique to you

**02:06:25** That is when it becomes something you will focus on and I know that was what made the difference for me

**02:06:30** also having the

**02:06:32** Availability to do this whenever I want whenever I need because balancing everything going on in our lives can make this stuff difficult to make a priority

**02:06:39** It's why it's so good that fitbot is available whenever you are inside of a fantastic app

**02:06:43** So trust me give this one a go. I think it can make a big difference

**02:06:47** Personalized training of this quality can be expensive fitbot is just 12.99 a month or 79.99 a year

**02:06:53** But you can get 25 off your membership when you sign up at fitbot.me slash cortex

**02:06:58** So go now and get your customized fitness plan in the awesome fitbot app at fitbot.me slash cortex

**02:07:04** And you'll get 25 of your membership fit

**02:07:08** Bod.me slash cortex for 25 off. Well, thanks to fitbot for the support of this show and relay FM

**02:07:14** I totally feel your pain with all that spark stuff because under the writing apps category

**02:07:20** Like I went through this same journey with

**02:07:23** Ulysses and obsidian the timeline here is I think it was like two years ago

**02:07:28** Ulysses did the same thing where they came out with like oh we have a whole new ui

**02:07:33** redesigned for our sidebar and it was just

**02:07:36** I don't need to go over it, but it was just the same sort of thing like it was insane

**02:07:39** Who is this for like I can't imagine the user this is better for

**02:07:43** And it was really frustrating the previous year

**02:07:46** Then I was half using ulysses and half using obsidian trying to see what is going to work for me

**02:07:53** and

**02:07:54** This is the year where I actually went through all of my ulysses archive and like moved

**02:08:01** Everything over to obsidian. So now like this this transition is complete

**02:08:06** I have absolutely nothing left in ulysses. None of the old projects i've been working on

**02:08:11** It's all been moved into obsidian and

**02:08:14** I'm really happy with that as a system like as heartbreaking as it was to have to switch from an app that I really liked

**02:08:23** The new one is much better and i'm so happy with like

**02:08:27** Actually now having everything in obsidian

**02:08:31** And it is one of these apps where the more you can completely have everything in it

**02:08:37** The more value it gets it's like a network effect for itself of being able to

**02:08:44** Reference all of your other little notes or quickly connect different scripts in different projects

**02:08:51** So yeah, there's there's a way in which like now having everything in obsidian

**02:08:55** I really like it because I can do things like

**02:08:58** Have an overview of like let me pull out

**02:09:02** Everything that i've ever written that might potentially be a script on any topic and say

**02:09:09** Sort by size which tells me like how much have I written about any of these individual topics?

**02:09:14** Like it's really nice to be able to go through that and then filter through projects and say like, okay

**02:09:20** This one is definitely dead. It's never going to happen or like, oh, this is intriguing

**02:09:24** I've been adding more to this over the years than I thought I have like this note on this topic is slowly getting bigger and bigger

**02:09:31** and

**02:09:32** One of the key things that I realized this year about using obsidian that has also just totally locked it in

**02:09:40** Has to do with what I was discussing about with omnifocus at the start over the years one of the like constant

**02:09:49** frustrations with

**02:09:51** Omnifocus as a to-do app for me was

**02:09:54** trying to put in

**02:09:57** All of the little things that relate to writing a script when i'm working on a project there can

**02:10:04** Easily come up like 10 little things while i'm writing a script where you go like, oh I need I need to just like

**02:10:11** Double check that part over here or go like what was that number? Like how many of these things were there really?

**02:10:19** Or oh, I should uh, I need to order the book for

**02:10:24** This thing and then read it or like this section needs to wait until i've read this other thing over here

**02:10:30** There's like there's just a lot of these little things and

**02:10:33** For whatever reason it just never worked in omnifocus to do this

**02:10:39** It always felt like it was like a little bit too disjointed

**02:10:43** When i'm writing that was also always too fluid like those to-dos could come and go very easily

**02:10:49** Where it's not that the to-do was ever completed in a sense, but I just instantly realized while writing

**02:10:54** Oh, actually, I don't ever need to do that because i've just cut this whole paragraph

**02:10:57** and so these three little like check these things in here they've just disappeared and

**02:11:03** Trying to go back into omnifocus and like what were those three because they're disconnected from the actual paragraph

**02:11:09** It was always just like a frustration point. I never really had a good way to handle that

**02:11:14** but

**02:11:15** Now an obsidian that is totally a solved problem

**02:11:19** And for anyone who knows what the words that i'm about to say

**02:11:23** I have returned to kind of the dream of the thing that got me through college, which was org mode on emacs

**02:11:31** but basically

**02:11:32** With obsidian now there's a little system where when i'm typing if something comes up in a sentence that

**02:11:38** Is basically like a little to-do there's a writer's trick which is

**02:11:42** Writers have always typed like tkk, which is a little set of letters that just doesn't pop up often in the english language

**02:11:48** And so writers have like as long as there there have been writers using typewriters

**02:11:52** Have used this as a trick to like oh, here's a thing that I need to go back

**02:11:55** But what's great in obsidian is when I do tkk. I have the computer automatically replace that

**02:12:02** With the little formatting for a footnote and in the footnote

**02:12:06** I can type whatever the to-do item is for like this is the thing that I need to check

**02:12:12** and then obsidian has a way where I can search across

**02:12:17** all of my notes in the entire system for everything that is formatted like a footnote and

**02:12:23** It puts it in a little list in the sidebar

**02:12:26** So it acts like a pseudo to-do list of here's all of the things

**02:12:31** And I can also sort them by like most recently typed which basically brings them up in terms of like what projects are you actively working on?

**02:12:39** Not every single thing in the whole system

**02:12:42** and it's really easy then to

**02:12:46** Work with to-dos that i'm adding

**02:12:49** In line in the script itself and it's like

**02:12:53** fan

**02:12:54** Fantastic like this is the solution to the biggest to-do problem that I have had for years

**02:13:01** and no other writing app has ever been able to

**02:13:06** perform

**02:13:07** both of these parts which is

**02:13:11** Have a way to enter something that is like a to-do

**02:13:15** But also have a way to search across

**02:13:19** Multiple projects in a really coherent way so that it's easy to like burn through a bunch of these things

**02:13:26** and what is just so fantastic about this is

**02:13:30** One of the things i've been really working on this year is trying to be really aware of

**02:13:36** work that I can kick to my

**02:13:39** couch self who later in the evening is going to be sitting on the couch and like is in a very low energy mode

**02:13:46** But he can do some stuff that's still useful work

**02:13:50** And so this is one of these ways where it's really great like oh, I can type with the script

**02:13:53** I can like throw in a like hey double check that number

**02:13:56** or one of the ones recently is like I need a spreadsheet that tells me exactly how big a

**02:14:02** subset of the states in the united states are

**02:14:05** Minus their lakes, but not all of the states. It's like that's a perfect kind of task to do on the couch

**02:14:12** Because it's totally brainless. It's just like hey put together this little thing look up a bunch of numbers copy and pay some stuff

**02:14:18** But like that kind of thing putting it in omni focus. It would never have made sense because

**02:14:23** Depending on if that paragraph just got like blown away, you know, like then that to-do goes away as well

**02:14:28** So it's it's really nice like I can be working in the morning like i'm trying to focus mainly on

**02:14:34** The words and the story and the overall flow of the script

**02:14:38** I can throw in these little to-do items and then in the evening when i'm being much lazier

**02:14:43** But still feeling like I can do some useful work

**02:14:46** I can quickly pull up a list of all of these things while they're in line and try to knock out like the easy ones

**02:14:52** That I can do like while my wife is watching a movie and i'm just sitting there

**02:14:56** having those to-dos

**02:14:58** Right in the script where they are is killer

**02:15:01** because even when i'm in this kind of low power mode i'll often

**02:15:06** Adjust the wording of a paragraph based on however that little to-do turned out

**02:15:12** So like that's also why it's really critical

**02:15:15** to have those items

**02:15:18** In line like here is the paragraph that it's related to and i'm just so happy about this

**02:15:24** Like I love everything about this

**02:15:26** Why format them like footnotes?

**02:15:29** Why not format them like to-dos? I think you can you can have to-dos in obsidian

**02:15:34** Right. Yeah, you can have straight up to-dos when i'm actually doing when i'm doing this search

**02:15:39** Is i'm looking for both the footnote formatting and the to-do formatting

**02:15:43** The reason i'm doing it as the footnote formatting is that when I export the script as a pdf to either give to

**02:15:49** Fact checkers or give to the animator. I can like strip out all the footnotes because like that stuff is mostly just for me

**02:15:56** So it's like a formatting issue of I want to be able to give this to someone without necessarily having the footnotes in there

**02:16:03** And it also just like it sort of is much nicer to work with the way obsidian happens to be formatted

**02:16:09** Okay, in theory, I could totally do it as actual to-do items

**02:16:12** It's just while writing it kind of works nicer to have them be pseudo footnotes

**02:16:17** Okay, so they function in most of the same for you, but there's just a it's just a way it's presented. Do you prefer?

**02:16:23** Yeah, it's it's 80 like a presentation format for each script

**02:16:28** That ends up being a major project like if we take the runways video that went up

**02:16:33** What's really great in obsidian is it can also now like i've got this system just like totally totally solid of

**02:16:41** There is the script and I also have a little

**02:16:45** project file which links to the script but the project file also links to like my personal research on this and it links to

**02:16:53** A little file that I call like scratch where I put paragraphs that I haven't deleted them

**02:16:58** Like maybe i'll bring them back

**02:17:00** But I think they're just out of the script for now

**02:17:02** So like I can copy and paste them over there

**02:17:04** And it's just really nice to be able in obsidian to look at

**02:17:07** The sort of project file which is an overview of everything that you want to do

**02:17:12** The research the scripts like stuff that you've sort of deleted, but maybe not entirely all at once

**02:17:18** and

**02:17:19** I will sometimes add little to-dos in the project file as well. And then I do use the regular to-do formatting

**02:17:28** But it's it's just like the main thing that really matters here is realizing

**02:17:34** The scripts and the writing and the the personal research that I do

**02:17:40** They're all a coherent little unit that just lives in this one app and I can see it all the time and not

**02:17:47** Switching out to a to-do manager that has no concept of where any of these things are related to

**02:17:54** that has just been absolutely killer this year and

**02:17:58** It's not something I could ever possibly have achieved with elises

**02:18:02** And it's just great

**02:18:04** Like I cannot express

**02:18:06** How much more pleasant it has been to work with this and I feel like I found the thing

**02:18:11** That really works with my brain and the other thing that's really nice about having

**02:18:15** Everything together in one system is also with obsidian often when i'm working on a script

**02:18:21** It's like okay. I'm typing typing typing. I'm writing writing writing. It'll pop into my brain like oh, actually

**02:18:27** The thing that i'm talking about here

**02:18:29** That made me think of a like a good couple of lines to add to another topic

**02:18:33** I was like boom boom boom with just a couple of little keyboard hits. I can switch into that other script

**02:18:39** Add that sentence and then like flip right back into the thing that I was working on

**02:18:44** And so this is one of these ways of like oh great even when i'm working on whatever the current main project is

**02:18:50** It's very easy and importantly

**02:18:53** Super fast to switch into a different project

**02:18:57** Add a couple of sentences and then like get right back into the main thing without breaking flow

**02:19:03** And that that's another thing that i've just never found in another writing app. Most of them kind of assume

**02:19:10** When you've loaded up whatever document you're working on

**02:19:14** You're going to be there and it's like no

**02:19:16** I want to be able to in 10 seconds get to a different thing add a sentence and get back

**02:19:21** And that's like in almost every other thing i've ever used that's really hard to do

**02:19:26** Or it's like literally impossible to do without taking your hands off the keyboard, which I don't want to so

**02:19:32** uh, yeah obsidian love it. This is the year that has totally made it just like so solid as

**02:19:40** The scripts my research and then the last little piece that I didn't know I was missing is

**02:19:47** Throw in in line to do's that relates to what you're working on

**02:19:52** At the exact point that you're working on them. Do you have a use obsidian on iowa's? It's funny that you asked that mic

**02:19:59** Because do you remember how people were suggesting that I use git a little while ago for all of my sinking needs? Yeah

**02:20:09** I'm gonna like i'm not really gonna bring that up again. Thanks everyone for suggesting git. Uh, it looks like a total nightmare

**02:20:15** I don't want to touch with the poll

**02:20:18** one of the things that has happened this year is

**02:20:21** There's a trade-off that i've decided to make which is I can solve a problem. I was talking about previously which is

**02:20:30** I want to be able to export a script as a pdf

**02:20:33** I want to be able to mark that up by hand and then give that mark up to my assistant and have her make the changes

**02:20:39** directly on the text file

**02:20:41** For a bunch of reasons that we don't need to get into that was really hard to do

**02:20:45** Unless I switched over to using dropbox to manage my obsidian files

**02:20:52** The trade-off there is if you use dropbox, you can't use obsidian on ios

**02:20:59** It requires icloud drive, right

**02:21:02** Yeah, you have to use it with icloud drive and then the icloud drive was the thing that like oh, this is a total nightmare

**02:21:08** Especially when my assistant is using a windows machine. It's like no

**02:21:11** No, you are going to totally bork your files that way and we tried to test it out

**02:21:15** And yes, it was like it just was totally unworkable. And so

**02:21:19** Last month. I finally made the call that

**02:21:23** While I do sometimes use obsidian on the ipad

**02:21:27** I don't think I use it enough to be worth the trade-off

**02:21:31** Of like over the last year

**02:21:34** Basically never having done any of the handwritten stuff that I think really adds a lot to the writing process

**02:21:40** So i've switched over to dropbox

**02:21:42** I've tested it with my assistant a couple of times so we know like this actually works. It works really solidly

**02:21:48** We can near instantly type on the same document without problems

**02:21:53** You can have a document open

**02:21:55** And they can be typing in it and it doesn't cause problems the sync issues or anything like that. It's all happening live

**02:22:01** Yeah

**02:22:01** So what happens is if she has the document open and I have the document open and she's typing

**02:22:06** I will see her sentences appear on my side live

**02:22:10** Where we would get into trouble is if we're both trying to type at the same time because dropbox isn't doing that

**02:22:16** So as long as both of us don't have hands on the keyboard

**02:22:19** There's no problem when you say live you don't mean like google docs live. No, no, that's why I said near live

**02:22:26** Right. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, but this is also not a problem because there's never any scenario where with both the time change and the way I

**02:22:35** Kind of like alternate which project i'm working on every day

**02:22:38** We're never going to have a conflict

**02:22:41** And also we've just set up the system that like at the very top

**02:22:45** She can just type the word like done or completed. So I I open the document on my end

**02:22:51** I know she's over like she's finished whatever work needs to happen

**02:22:53** These things are very workable with a convention like a check-in check-out convention system

**02:22:58** Right like me and you have that for the logic projects of the edits, right? Like

**02:23:02** You won't touch it till I tell you to and I won't touch it until you tell me to

**02:23:07** It's very simple

**02:23:08** Right, like it just takes a message if like i'm done that edits yours and then you'll say i'm done that edits yours and in

**02:23:13** Between those times neither of us

**02:23:16** Just don't ever touch it. Just don't touch it. Like you just don't need to touch it. Don't touch it

**02:23:20** Yeah, I like I even have that system with myself with uh final cut and dropbox

**02:23:26** Where everyone's always like you can't have final cut projects at dropbox

**02:23:29** It's like yeah, you can't if two people want to open it at the same time

**02:23:33** But like I routinely uh want to edit a final cut project on a different project

**02:23:38** but my

**02:23:39** Check-in with myself system is i'm never allowed to open final cut if dropbox is sinking right like if though if that little logo

**02:23:46** Is spinning around it's like I am not allowed to open up final cut right and that but like ever since I set that rule

**02:23:52** It's like i've now I haven't had a problem in years with like a sinking conflict with final cut and dropbox

**02:23:58** Even though everyone says it's impossible. So no, no the check-in check out stuff really fixes stuff

**02:24:03** So that's like another check mark in favor of obsidian and yes, I have to give it up on ios, which is

**02:24:11** Slightly annoying but if you have to pick like what's the trade-off here?

**02:24:15** I think this is the correct trade-off now

**02:24:17** I haven't actually used this that much because we've like just gotten it set up because I finally decided

**02:24:22** I'm going to make that decision. So we'll see how that goes over the course of the next year

**02:24:26** But i'm i'm really happy about that set of trade-offs of okay

**02:24:29** I can go back to the hand editing of scripts also really key is that I can share with her

**02:24:35** Just the active projects and don't have to risk like oh this entire weird database

**02:24:42** That is like the inside of my brain and arranged very squirrely

**02:24:47** She's not exposed to any of that

**02:24:50** And also it doesn't yeah, and it doesn't risk like getting messed up from her side of it either

**02:24:56** It's like no. No, we just have

**02:24:59** at most like

**02:25:01** Five documents that are actually being shared between us and that's perfect. That's all we need reminds me of like the ark of the covenant

**02:25:08** moment in indiana jones

**02:25:11** Like somebody opens that they're sitting there just their face melts off

**02:25:17** I think a lot of tools exist on a spectrum of

**02:25:22** Is this a team using it or is it one person using it and you can be in a real disaster if you're using like

**02:25:28** One one way or the other and obsidian is very much on the like this is an amazing tool

**02:25:35** For one person. It's not a great tool for a bunch of people

**02:25:39** And like notion is on the opposite end like this is a great tool for a bunch of people like

**02:25:44** It might not be the best tool just for one person. But yeah, so anyway the

**02:25:49** Not having to expose her to absolutely everything that's going on in obsidian is definitely a plus side. I would be

**02:25:56** Very surprised if they do not try to tackle the team

**02:25:59** problem

**02:26:00** And like create yeah, they might team system or I mean if they want to

**02:26:05** I mean if they want to be a successful long-term business, they will go for that, right?

**02:26:09** Like success with the money is you get companies to buy into stuff. You're in the enterprise now, right?

**02:26:14** Like that's true. That's why all these companies go that way like if they want to turn it into a big business

**02:26:20** Which i'm sure they do

**02:26:23** I don't know but I don't know the people that make obsidian

**02:26:26** But my expect I would be very surprised if they didn't try to tackle the enterprise

**02:26:30** Yeah, I agree with that. I'm just saying like in its current state. It's clearly a one person tool

**02:26:35** I just want to mention a couple of little add-ons to obsidian if anyone wants to try it as I like top recommended ones

**02:26:41** So obsidian also has this whole complicated system of like plugins that you can add which change the fundamental way that it works

**02:26:48** And for me like my top four recommended ones are if you're a writer you can enable typewriter mode

**02:26:54** So there's a plugin that lets you keep the cursor in the center so that the text scrolls

**02:26:58** Up when you press the down arrow key and vice versa

**02:27:01** Which is just really nice to visually keep the text in the middle and also so you can see what's before whatever you're writing

**02:27:08** And what's after whatever you're writing always

**02:27:11** So I really like that

**02:27:13** Uh, there's a plugin which is called advanced tables

**02:27:16** Which allows you to just have slightly more complicated tables than the default and also keeps those tables really tidy

**02:27:24** There's a plugin called outliner

**02:27:26** Which makes I guess the way they kind of describe it is it makes outlines work much more like rome

**02:27:33** So if you're a rome user and you're thinking about going to obsidian like outliner is the number one thing that you should just install

**02:27:39** I really like it and it's also the thing that is making me think that I would use like a note for cortex in obsidian

**02:27:47** Is being able to just like entirely through the keyboard do a bunch of outline stuff

**02:27:52** Indent outdent and I think through dropbox. I should be able to have notes that append to a file

**02:27:58** That's also part of like why I didn't think of doing this before is there was no way to append to a document in

**02:28:05** iCloud but you can do that with dropbox and then if you really get into obsidian

**02:28:10** You should probably check out data view which is it's a plugin that allows you to do the thing that I mentioned at the beginning

**02:28:16** like more complicated queries

**02:28:19** Show me all of the documents. I have tagged with script sorted by file size or sorted by last modified

**02:28:28** Or you know show me all of the ideas that I haven't marked as dead that are also

**02:28:34** Non-zero file sizes like this kind of thing. It allows you to do much more complicated queries

**02:28:39** So those are the things if you're going to use obsidian, I would probably recommend installing them

**02:28:42** They make it significantly more helpful

**02:28:45** And also my favorite theme is still the 80s neon theme which is just awesome

**02:28:49** That makes me feel like i'm a cool hacker every time i'm working on a project

**02:28:53** Also in this category since this is sort of like writing and research because I don't know where else to mention it

**02:28:58** I'm just going to mention safari and safari's tab groups as a

**02:29:02** thank you to the team who has made this like man tab groups have just

**02:29:07** Have become absolutely vital over the last year for all projects. Like I love them so much and

**02:29:15** I was I was trying to

**02:29:17** I can't find

**02:29:19** Numbers for these things, but I have some research projects where the tab groups are

**02:29:27** Insanely long like i'm looking at one for what is my current project and there have to be a hundred tabs at least

**02:29:35** Open for uh one of several projects that I have

**02:29:39** I just love them. The tab groups are great

**02:29:41** The fact that they sync is also really good for this

**02:29:45** Like splitting the work day kind of thing between when i'm on the couch and when i'm in my office

**02:29:52** Where when i'm in researching mode?

**02:29:54** I tend to like open up a ton of tabs and just like keep adding and adding and adding stuff

**02:29:59** And then at the end of the day when i'm on the couch, I try to do the reverse

**02:30:03** So like go through and just close out the tabs where you looked up something

**02:30:08** But you don't need to have this currently open

**02:30:10** And so it's a nice way in which a project kind of can be

**02:30:14** grown and trimmed and grown and trimmed every day by like adding tabs and removing tabs

**02:30:20** And it just wouldn't be as easy to do without sync like if they just lived on one computer it'd be extremely frustrating

**02:30:26** But I will just say

**02:30:28** The developers for safari. I am begging you i'm i'm i'm gonna be down on my knees and i'm begging you

**02:30:35** To let me have the option to open new links in a default tab group

**02:30:42** It's still it just kills me. This is so annoying. It drives me mad

**02:30:46** Okay, you're on my team with this now because like when it first came out like people were fighting against this

**02:30:51** They're like, this is not how browsers work. And i'm just like this is insane

**02:30:55** Like it says the the thing that I keep thinking of is it's like if the if the developers for notes were like, oh, hey

**02:31:02** All of your folders and notes will sync with icloud

**02:31:06** But every time you make a new note

**02:31:08** It's going to be saved in a local folder on that device that doesn't sync and it's like it it's so frustrating

**02:31:16** It kills me

**02:31:18** and it like

**02:31:20** It ends up causing me to feel like a janitor who has to go around and

**02:31:26** On different devices constantly try to clear out whatever happened to get opened up locally on the device

**02:31:33** I hate it so much

**02:31:34** So please if this isn't an option by the next state of the apps i'm gonna be so sad like this may be across

**02:31:42** Every piece of software I use my absolute number one requested feature

**02:31:48** Please I have a tab group called browsing

**02:31:52** Let all new links open in the browsing tab group and sync everywhere. I'm begging you safari developers

**02:32:00** I am begging you let this be an option. It's so frustrating

**02:32:05** So when I add entertainment as a new category and in trying to think about this I didn't really have good

**02:32:13** Recommendations that weren't also tied to hardware in some way

**02:32:17** You know if you talk about like entertainment like I can tell you that what streaming services I use and what podcast apps

**02:32:22** I use but to me none of them were really like

**02:32:25** Here's something

**02:32:26** unique about this that you kind of

**02:32:29** It's special to this app because really it's the content more than the right service or the app

**02:32:35** But I wanted to recommend sonos the sonos speakers. Yeah, okay

**02:32:40** So we just got some sonos stuff at home because we just moved and I wanted to

**02:32:45** Kind of lay out the new home to always be able to play music in the whole house

**02:32:50** And you know i've tried stuff like this with home pods, but I I don't really like the way that you share music to home

**02:32:56** Pods, I don't like airplay. I think controlling music

**02:33:00** On home pods is frustrating like there's always this element of like i'm gonna send the music here

**02:33:06** Oh, it's the worst right and now do I have control of other audio then how do I control it's very annoying

**02:33:14** And the thoroughly considered podcast tom and dan had adamusagoran and they were talking about the sonos

**02:33:21** Move, I think it is. They have like a portable speaker, right?

**02:33:25** There's like a big one. They have like a small one and they have like a like a big one

**02:33:28** It's like a full speaker. It is the move

**02:33:32** And they were talking about that and then I kind of started looking into it

**02:33:35** I was like, I think this might be what I want. So I set up sonos last week

**02:33:39** It's great

**02:33:40** So I have a couple of speakers in the house at the moment and the app is so smart

**02:33:46** In like a way that I can't believe they've been able to do it

**02:33:50** So you can sign in in the sonos app to multiple music streaming services

**02:33:56** from multiple people

**02:33:59** So in the sonos app, I have connected my apple music account and adina's spotify account

**02:34:05** And inside the application you can choose the music you want to play from either of those services

**02:34:13** It includes like all of these stuff that you've added to your service and the playlist that those services make so like

**02:34:20** adina's spotify playlists are in there my apple music playlists are in there

**02:34:25** And it's very easy to control what's playing where you could just choose in the app like press a button to play it on

**02:34:31** This one and then you can just with one tap of a button then play it on multiple speakers

**02:34:36** You can group the speakers together

**02:34:38** Is really good. It's very easy to control

**02:34:41** And the ui of dealing with the music searching for music and it searches all of the systems that are connected at once

**02:34:48** Right like all of the services I should say that connected it searches all of them

**02:34:52** It's really clever and I think it's very smart and it's integrated very well with spotify

**02:34:57** So if you're just in the spotify app

**02:34:59** You could just press a button and it will start like just immediately playing the music on the sonos

**02:35:04** I could just press one button and with apple music I can control it in the same clunky way

**02:35:10** I can control home parts if I want to right like it has airplay support. You can do all of that

**02:35:15** Um, it also has like its own voice assistant built into it

**02:35:19** Which is good for like stop it like starting and stopping music if you want to do that

**02:35:23** So here's a fun thing the voice that they have used, you know, like all of these assistants have a voice right where it talks back to you

**02:35:32** Giancarlo esposito is the voice you may know him as one of the villains of breaking bad

**02:35:38** One of the villains of mandalorian it is he's got a great voice

**02:35:43** Right super interesting to be like we're going to choose this like really well known villain

**02:35:49** As are as the voice assistant, but it sounds great. That's an opinionated voice decision

**02:35:55** Yeah, I mean you've chosen one of the great voices working today

**02:35:59** But like just intriguing like how people recognize that voice. I recognize him as like a terrifying villain

**02:36:06** But you know you do use sonos. He's a villain in the boys. Yeah, he's got a little niche

**02:36:10** He's carved out for him great villain, but now also sonos assistant voice. But yeah, I

**02:36:17** I'm very happy with this purchase and also like because we haven't got all of our stuff set up. We haven't I haven't unboxed our home pods yet

**02:36:25** But I can also attach the audio from my apple tv to the sonos too

**02:36:30** So like I had set up the sonos. That's what I was wondering

**02:36:33** Yeah

**02:36:34** And I can also play all my apple tv content through the sonos too and it also sounds fantastic

**02:36:39** so

**02:36:40** I'm

**02:36:41** I'm like I might like

**02:36:43** We haven't set up the home pods yet. I don't know if i'm

**02:36:47** going to

**02:36:48** I haven't decided I may just

**02:36:51** Use the sono speaker instead of no, so they have all their own equipment

**02:36:56** Like I might get a sono soundbar and just use that

**02:36:59** Instead of setting up the home pod pair that I have before i'm not sure yet

**02:37:03** But I like it when you're logged into apple music in the sonos app

**02:37:08** Does it basically just show you your apple music library? Like is it mirroring?

**02:37:13** Yeah, I have access to all of it. Could you use the sonos app as a complete replacement for the apple music app and like

**02:37:19** Never open the apple music app again. I believe so. Hmm. Okay, that's quite that's quite interesting

**02:37:25** I can't confirm all of that for you right now because I can't use the sonos app

**02:37:30** When i'm not connected to my sono system. What do you mean by that? Well, i'm not at home right now

**02:37:35** All my sonos is at home

**02:37:36** So like if I open the app now, it can't connect to the sonos. So it doesn't show me anything

**02:37:41** Okay, I guess what i'm saying is can you use that app to play music to your air pods on your way home?

**02:37:48** No

**02:37:49** Okay, so it does. Okay, so that's that's the limitation. It has to be connected to the speakers

**02:37:53** Okay

**02:37:53** That you must be on the same network

**02:37:55** As the speaker to use the sonos app because the sonos app is just a controller for the sonos speakers

**02:38:01** Okay. Yeah, that's interesting. Especially being able to connect to the apple tv. That's very nice. It has an airplay

**02:38:06** Airplay stuff. I think i'm gonna i'm gonna wait to see if apple comes out with something else and for the home pods

**02:38:13** But if they don't like at some point i'm gonna have to move and this is the first like sounds

**02:38:19** Reasonable option to move to that i've come across. Yeah, so yeah, that's a good recommendation

**02:38:25** This is sort of entertainment, but I don't know where else to put it. I feel like last year you were talking about moving to more

**02:38:31** RSS. Oh, yeah. Yeah

**02:38:33** I'm really glad that you suggested that I feel like that was a suggestion that I like hit me at the exact right time

**02:38:39** When I was open to something like this of like i'm frustrated with my internet experience

**02:38:44** I I need to make it better. And so i've tried to go all in on rss

**02:38:50** And i've done it by uh using two rss apps

**02:38:54** I'm using reader and i'm using net newswire

**02:38:58** I'm using reader to try to collect all of the interesting

**02:39:02** Bloggers who I want to follow and it's been kind of delightful this year to discover

**02:39:07** Oh blogs aren't quite as dead as I thought they were like there's a bunch of interesting writers out there who are

**02:39:13** Are like still doing traditional blogs?

**02:39:15** So it's been fun doing that i'd love it if listeners have any suggestions for interesting blogs to follow to leave them on the reddit

**02:39:23** Because i'm looking out for new stuff. That is one of the broadest

**02:39:27** Like do you want to give like a blog what kind of blogs like just you just like has anyone got website recommendations for me?

**02:39:36** Cool new websites

**02:39:38** I guess no, I guess I guess. Yeah, what I mean by that is

**02:39:42** I'll give an example. Like there's a blog called a collection of unmitigated pedantry

**02:39:49** And this is like a guy who's a historian and he just writes

**02:39:54** really interesting articles that go into detail about

**02:40:00** Something related to history usually vaguely logistics related

**02:40:04** and he like he caught my attention when he did a series about like

**02:40:08** how realistic could the

**02:40:11** military logistics of lord of the rings be

**02:40:14** And this is the kind of stuff that I just love or it's like someone really digs into detail about like some topic that they

**02:40:22** Care a lot about. Yeah, when I say like oh i'm interested in some blogs like i'm looking for like

**02:40:28** Interesting people who care a lot about something it to me. There's also just like totally excludes everything that's vaguely politics

**02:40:36** Uh, i'm not interested in anyone who's like a pundit in any way

**02:40:40** So i've just been trying to like build up a little collection of like, oh these people are interesting

**02:40:45** writers in in the way that I don't know in a pre-internet age like they'd be writing a column in a magazine about

**02:40:52** a topic, but I put this into entertainment because i've really tried to train myself over the past year of

**02:40:59** When you have that moment of like i'm going to go on the internet. It's like no don't do that open reader

**02:41:05** And see what is in here since the last time and like go through

**02:41:10** The interesting people that you found on the internet to read their stuff and like that should be the default starting place

**02:41:16** but what has also been great is

**02:41:19** The reason i'm using two rss readers is i'm also using net newswire

**02:41:24** To track all of what would be my youtube subscriptions

**02:41:27** So this is the same thing where i'm trying to train a behavior, which is

**02:41:32** Oh, hey when you want to like watch something

**02:41:35** Don't go to youtube.com and let the algorithm do it's like here's the eight things that we think are going to be most engaging to you

**02:41:42** It's like no, no

**02:41:44** It's the same thing here

**02:41:45** Who do you think make interesting videos and just subscribe to them and then see when they have something new?

**02:41:53** And i'm just really liking this as the separate experience. So this is what i've been doing in terms of like

**02:42:00** default reading entertainment for the internet and default video entertainment for the internet use two rss readers and just like open them up

**02:42:09** intentionally subscribe to something intentionally read and watch something

**02:42:14** Use much less of the like

**02:42:16** Hey an algorithm thought you might be interested in this article or this video and it's definitely improved my internet experience

**02:42:24** So rss it's the new old hotness. Thanks mike

**02:42:29** anytime man

**02:42:33** Do you have anything else you want to mention in entertainment? I don't think so. I think i'm good with sonos

**02:42:37** I think that's my one good pick. All right, then. Let me just give uh, three video game recommendations

**02:42:43** For this entertainment section. I didn't know we were video game recommending that. I mean now we're in a different world, but go on

**02:42:48** No, that's that's entertaining. Where else would video games go if they were not entertainment?

**02:42:53** Sure, the two are going to be super quick. This is no surprise. I feel sort of dumb mentioning it, but i'm gonna say it again

**02:42:59** Magic the gathering there's a magic the gathering arena

**02:43:02** It's amazing like I was just thinking about it today like people complain about it forever

**02:43:08** If you've listened to me for this long

**02:43:10** If you've made it this far in our state of the apps episode

**02:43:13** You may be a person who would like magic the gathering

**02:43:16** And it's still kind of amazing to me that the online version is as good as it is

**02:43:21** I think there's tons of stuff that's just like

**02:43:24** Better in the online version and so yeah, it's just like i've spent a huge amount of time on it this year

**02:43:30** Haven't regretted a minute spent love it

**02:43:34** I've also mentioned hades talked about it a couple times. Just want to like reemphasize big recommendation. I think we've been talking about it in

**02:43:40** Mortex. Yeah. Yeah, we have been talking about it more and more tech. So if you haven't listened in mortex

**02:43:45** Hades dungeon roguelike on the steam deck i've been playing it

**02:43:51** So much better than it has any right to be just like highly highly recommend one of the best games in the past many years

**02:43:59** And here's the one I really want to push so I stumbled upon a game a couple months ago. It's called

**02:44:05** dungeon wars 2

**02:44:08** dungeon wars 2 is a tower defense game

**02:44:12** now this is a genre that I was trying to think of like a metaphor where

**02:44:18** It feels like when the iphone

**02:44:21** First came out the tower defense genre kind of exploded like there were a bunch of these

**02:44:27** Can I ask you is it dungeon warfare or dungeon wars?

**02:44:31** Oh, yes. Thank you. Mike. The correct name is dungeon warfare, too

**02:44:35** Right, this is the like when I looked at it on my ipad. It's that abbreviated name, but yes, this dungeon warfare, too

**02:44:41** is the full name

**02:44:43** so

**02:44:45** If you like tower defense games I feel that in the last decade this genre

**02:44:53** the best metaphor that I can think of is

**02:44:57** It's like a lake full of algae

**02:45:00** It's not dead

**02:45:02** But it's not exactly alive or interesting either. Yeah, it was like the game

**02:45:08** Format for a long time on ios and ipad os right like it was like yeah

**02:45:13** So many of them and it was so popular and then it just seemed to stop with the exception of the kingdom rush series

**02:45:20** Which has been like the uncontested top contender in this for years now

**02:45:26** Like I just think most of these games are terribly

**02:45:29** Uninteresting a lot of them are borderline scammy and just like trying to keep your attention

**02:45:35** It's just awful and i've always been really sad because I just

**02:45:39** I love this genre so much

**02:45:42** You're just building towers and there's a bunch of guys who are going to try to run past them and your towers are going

**02:45:47** To try to shoot them down. It's so simple, but it can be really satisfying

**02:45:51** But i've been extra sad because kingdom rush which has been this like top contender

**02:45:55** It's always felt to me like the designers of kingdom rush

**02:46:00** Like something like they're they're getting something else out of tower defense games that i'm not

**02:46:07** That they they seem to be slightly more on the puzzle side like oh, we're going to have a very small number of towers

**02:46:14** And you win by figuring out the exact right order to build them in

**02:46:18** As like hey, you know what? I want out of a tower defense game a lot of towers

**02:46:22** Like that's what I want to build. That's the whole thing that i'm looking for and kingdom rush always seems to push against that

**02:46:28** So anyway, all of this is to say like I was on one of my sad trolls through the app store being like

**02:46:34** Oh, let me see if I can find anything interesting. That's a tower defense game

**02:46:38** And I somehow stumbled upon dungeon warfare too

**02:46:41** And I love it so much like it feels like the person who made this is like

**02:46:46** Ah, this is what I love out of tower defense games lots of towers. They're really interesting

**02:46:53** Like it's the first time in years i've seen someone

**02:46:57** Do a bunch of interesting different stuff in the genre

**02:47:01** So like if you have ever enjoyed a tower defense game, you have to give this one a try

**02:47:07** the other thing that's unbelievable to me is

**02:47:09** How deep it is like the number of towers the number of upgrades the number of different abilities they have

**02:47:17** The number of like these weird skills that you can add on

**02:47:20** It also has a whole system where like you can increasingly make each level more difficult, but in

**02:47:27** Interesting ways. It's like I just love everything about it and looking it up

**02:47:32** It seems like it's a one person project and it's again one of these things like aside from the graphics

**02:47:37** Which are a little janky. It's crazy to me that a single person made this and it's like a several year old game

**02:47:44** I don't think anyone is paying much attention to it and I just like

**02:47:48** Kind of wish that my recommendation here causes everyone who listens to go out and like buy this game

**02:47:55** It is fantastic. I cannot recommend it highly enough

**02:47:59** Absolutely loved it have also sunk in so many hours on the couch playing this it's great

**02:48:05** Dungeon warfare 2 if you've ever enjoyed a tower defense game get this one

**02:50:50** okay with my apple watch and

**02:50:53** I much prefer a couple of features of sleep plus plus to apple's built in sleep tracking

**02:50:58** I like the layout. I find the layout to be clearer the way that apple kind of draws the bubbles around everything

**02:51:06** It doesn't really show me the information that I want and I enjoy the increased contrast of colors between like my

**02:51:12** You know when i'm awake when i'm asleep, you know, it kind of tracks that information

**02:51:16** I also really like the readiness score

**02:51:19** So sleep plus plus takes in a bunch of factors based on how much sleep you've had

**02:51:23** And tries to make it like an assessment for how prepared you should be for the day

**02:51:28** I just like this information. Like it's like a

**02:51:30** A fun little thing and in the morning, I might check it and it kind of I have been making some decisions

**02:51:35** Recently about maybe some of the things that I might get up to in the day or being more forgiving of myself

**02:51:42** If i'm not so effective if I realized that I did not get good sleep the night before so

**02:51:48** I've been enjoying that. Um, I was wondering what kind of

**02:51:51** Impact sleep tracking would have on my life and I think so far it's actually had a pretty good one

**02:51:56** If just in the fact that like

**02:51:58** If i've had a bad night's sleep, then maybe I will be easier on myself the next day. I'm gonna recommend

**02:52:04** Tally it's a dead simple app to just

**02:52:08** Like count up a number every time you tap on a screen

**02:52:12** And I ended up using this in hawaii when I was recovering from covet and I was trying to build up my strength by just

**02:52:21** Walking up and down the world's saddest tiny hill a bunch of times

**02:52:25** And so it was slow enough that like I would you know

**02:52:29** Start thinking about something else when I got back to the bottom of the hill and then forget by the time I got back

**02:52:33** Up to the hill again like wait, how many times have I done this?

**02:52:36** Did I do this five times or six times?

**02:52:38** And like I love an app that just does one thing really well as like tally if you need to count something

**02:52:45** While you're probably going to be slightly bored and forget. This is the app for you

**02:52:50** City mapper. Oh wow. I feel like that's a real blast from the past. I haven't thought of city mapper in years

**02:52:56** What are you using city mapper for? Well, so the way that I came to city mapper is

**02:53:02** I wanted to have

**02:53:05** access to

**02:53:07** Something like an oyster card, which is our transit card

**02:53:10** But on my iphone

**02:53:12** Okay, it boggles my mind that you cannot use an oyster card

**02:53:17** On an iphone like you have to have the card you can't add the card to your apple wallet and use it as nfc

**02:53:24** I can't believe that that is still true. That's

**02:53:27** They just want you to use contactless, but I don't want to do this because then it generates like

**02:53:34** 40 transactions a month on my credit card statement, which I don't want right?

**02:53:39** So I wanted a way to be able to pay for effectively a travel card or something

**02:53:46** But even then if I I had a travel card for a while, so I pay once but it is on an oyster card

**02:53:51** And I didn't want the card

**02:53:54** Then someone told me about the city mapper pass which is exactly this

**02:53:59** It is a prepaid card

**02:54:02** Which gives you travel around london, but it is just the same price as I was paying before

**02:54:08** But with city mapper, it's basically like a prepaid master card is the kind of way that they do it

**02:54:13** It's really interesting how they've made this work

**02:54:15** City mapper itself is only available in a set amount of cities in the world and city mapper pass is even more restricted in where it's available

**02:54:23** But they send you a card but you can choose to forego the card and have it in apple pay

**02:54:29** If you have it in apple pay you have to choose to either use it always on the watch or always on the phone again

**02:54:34** Like it's complicated the way that they've set this up. I just have it on my phone

**02:54:38** I have it in the express travel thing. So I don't have to activate apple pay

**02:54:42** I just hold my phone near it and it just bings and now I can go through the barriers and it's all set

**02:54:49** In doing that I then started using city mapper more as my transit app rather than google maps and city mapper

**02:54:56** kicks butt in london like it

**02:55:00** wrecks everything else in how

**02:55:03** Good it is telling me to get from here to here

**02:55:06** and like so then I started using city mapper more and they also have like a

**02:55:11** Something you can pay for to like give better routing which I also do and i'm super happy with it

**02:55:16** Like it does things like it gives really good options for types of transport and like connecting

**02:55:21** It gives you really great suggestions for where to stand on public transport for like

**02:55:26** Where is the best place to be for the connection that you're going to make?

**02:55:30** And then their live activity that they just added is incredible. It's incredible

**02:55:36** Yeah, i'm looking at these screenshots. This is really nice. Like if I was still commuting, I would totally use this every day

**02:55:41** This is great

**02:55:42** Like they've always had a thing where like when you're navigating from place to place it can send you push notifications for like

**02:55:49** Go right here if you're walking and then like get ready to get off the train that kind of thing, right?

**02:55:53** Stop before but now they've put this in a live activity, which is always there

**02:55:57** It's also in the dynamic island if you've got the phone unlocked, but it's showing me like

**02:56:02** You are 115 meters away from arriving at the station

**02:56:06** It's like one of the things I showed you there are trains in three minutes nine minutes 20 minutes

**02:56:10** And then like down the bottom the your final arrival time currently is this based on where you are

**02:56:17** And then when you're on the train like or getting on the train

**02:56:19** It's like get on at in a minute and get on at the back and then when you're on the train, it's like it shows a

**02:56:27** train line with all of the stops and your dot moving along the line

**02:56:33** It's unbelievably good. And then it's alerts you like hey, the next stop is your stop get ready to get off

**02:56:40** Killer so good. I am so happy with this

**02:56:44** Uh, I I don't know what took me so long

**02:56:47** But city mapper seems to be one of those things that like if it's in your city

**02:56:51** And you start to use it you become one of these people that I have become which is a city mapper person

**02:56:57** Where I keep telling people how good city mapper is I was at a dinner with someone

**02:57:01** Who told me this stuff then I used it and now I am a city mapper person telling people to use city mapper

**02:57:08** It is I don't know how they're so good. I don't know how either google or apple haven't bought them

**02:57:15** Because they seem to have a way of taking transit information

**02:57:19** And doing so much more with it where I believe they're probably just taking the same information

**02:57:24** That any of these companies can have access to but the way in which they present it

**02:57:29** Excellent and they deal with things like we've had disruptions for like there's been rail strikes and stuff like that in the uk

**02:57:35** And they give you a way like if you need to get somewhere on a certain day

**02:57:39** We can route you for that or when we're having our heat wave. They had like a specific routing option

**02:57:44** For air condition routes. Oh my god. Yeah, wow

**02:57:48** So good, like they're very reactive to things and like update the application with these specific things

**02:57:54** Wow, that looks that looks really nice. Yeah, it's super good

**02:57:57** I'll half mention what i've said before is the closest thing for this for bikes is an app called bike citizens

**02:58:03** It's not remotely this level but it is the same thing where it's like

**02:58:07** It's bike directions in the city

**02:58:09** But it like totally blows the regular recommendations out of the water with a bunch of options like I want the easiest route

**02:58:15** I want the fastest route. I want a nice balance of the two things like apple maps are getting better for bike routing

**02:58:21** Like it's definitely improving but it's the same thing like every time I look at bike citizens and like how has someone not bought this?

**02:58:26** I don't really understand but okay my next actual lightning recommendation

**02:58:32** Is an app called plant snap?

**02:58:36** so

**02:58:37** This came up in hawaii where one day I woke up and like something out of a nightmare

**02:58:43** The whole property was covered in these like weird spiky pod plants and it was very strange

**02:58:50** You may remember that I've I messaged you some images of like mike

**02:58:53** You won't believe like what just turned up in the garden. It turns out like oh, they weren't really a problem or anything

**02:58:59** But anyway, I was discussing this with my sister-in-law and she's like, oh before you touch anything

**02:59:04** You should probably use this app called plant snap

**02:59:07** And it's exactly what it sounds like you take a picture of a plant and then it identifies what it is and tells you about it

**02:59:14** And this is another one of these things. It just felt kind of like magic

**02:59:17** But it worked really well like oh i'm in this jungle like I see a plant

**02:59:21** You can take a picture of it and then give it a couple seconds to analyze it and it spits back like oh, here's this plant

**02:59:27** Here's what you need to know about it. Uh this thing that looks like some kind of spiky nightmare thing

**02:59:32** It's actually not a problem at all. Don't worry about it

**02:59:34** So if you're surrounded by a lot of unknown plants check out plant snap

**02:59:40** There are sometimes in the lightning round. There are things that come up which are like there's just absolutely no world in which I would have

**02:59:46** Imagined you would have picked that, you know

**02:59:52** I'm gonna mention snap motion

**02:59:55** This is an app which will give you screenshots

**02:59:59** Of videos, okay. So you open a video on your mac in snap motion

**03:00:04** and it has a big button which is a camera icon and

**03:00:08** As you're watching the video you can hit that button and it will spit out files onto your desktop

**03:00:15** That are images I use this to get the thumbnails for our animated cortex videos

**03:00:21** So as I watch each episode of closex animated in snap motion

**03:00:25** I'm hitting the button every time there's like a frame which I think could be fun for a thumbnail

**03:00:29** And then I look through them and choose the best ones and they're the ones that ones or one that I will use

**03:00:35** For the thumbnails for the videos. So really love the little app

**03:00:39** It's very simple and it does exactly what I wanted because before I was like taking screenshots and formatting them

**03:00:46** But this it like obviously just spits it out in the right size for a video, right?

**03:00:51** Because it's just taking it from the video and then I can just use those as the thumbnail options

**03:00:56** Okay, that's that's what I was gonna ask

**03:00:57** So that's the reason is it's keeping the aspect ratio the same that's the main reason to use this over just screenshotting it

**03:01:04** Well, but also it's just easier like when I was screenshotting it depending on the app that I would use I use like clean shot

**03:01:10** Right. It's like

**03:01:11** Then I might have to format it a little bit like to get it the right size or and it's also like I have to pause

**03:01:18** And then you write like I pause here and I take the screenshot play with snap motion

**03:01:23** You never pause you just hit you just keep hitting the screenshot button. It's just throwing the screenshots onto the desktop

**03:01:28** It's it's just like really simple. I love it. It's a great little app keeping with the hawaii theme

**03:01:33** I'm also going to recommend an app called luminous

**03:01:37** Uh, it's it's not specifically for hawaii

**03:01:39** But there's a bunch of these augmented reality. Look at the sky apps. I've never I've never understood this

**03:01:47** Yeah, it's like it's like a strange genre of this

**03:01:51** But I I spent a little time trying to figure out

**03:01:53** Which of these is actually good because it's one of these things like a bunch of them are just terrible like they're absolutely awful

**03:01:59** But luminous is great. It's I think it's the best one

**03:02:03** and

**03:02:04** It really was quite interesting when I was in hawaii to use this and the thing that was that's different about luminous

**03:02:12** Or at least that they did better is it allows you to look and track things that are

**03:02:19** Below the horizon and there's I it's almost hard to describe but it's a very interesting experience

**03:02:27** To go out into the night and be able to look around with your phone

**03:02:32** See objects like not just planets and stars, but also a ton of things like satellites or the international space station

**03:02:41** And kind of see where they are

**03:02:44** Especially when you can do this weird thing of like look

**03:02:48** Through the earth below the horizon and see like oh

**03:02:53** There's a pattern of like five starlink satellites that are going to be coming up over the horizon in a second or like

**03:02:59** There's the international space station like sort of through the earth on the opposite side

**03:03:04** I've never been one of these like constellations star people like I don't really care

**03:03:10** But if the app is almost entirely free

**03:03:13** I think it's worth it for almost anyone to just

**03:03:16** Download it and try it once as an interesting thing to look at the sky

**03:03:20** Like I just I really enjoyed it and I think that this is the best version of this sort of app that exists

**03:03:27** moon

**03:03:28** Moom, this is an app for arranging windows on the mac

**03:03:33** So, uh, our friend david sparks was bugging me for a while

**03:03:37** Telling me that I should try something like this out and I did

**03:03:41** And I have and I really like it. I don't use it very extensively, but I use it for like a few set things

**03:03:49** I have a few keyboard commands now like one

**03:03:52** Well, I have one for like kind of what I consider to be the ideal

**03:03:57** Windows size for if i'm using something not completely full screen

**03:04:00** But like it takes up the majority of the screen still with some space on the side

**03:04:05** I use this mostly for safari. So really it's like my ideal safari window size

**03:04:10** Then I have like a bunch of presets that will take windows like at like 75 percent

**03:04:16** 50 25 percent on each kind of left and right side

**03:04:20** Yeah, so like I have like my my kind of my main one and then you go one to the right

**03:04:24** It will make it 75 and 25 percent just like yeah, like splits the windows apart

**03:04:29** So then I can very easily in a couple of uh keystrokes have one window feel 25 percent one window feels 75

**03:04:35** And I have some preset ones that will take two windows and put them side by side to each other

**03:04:40** And one that will basically put a window bang in the middle of the screen

**03:04:44** So these are just like simple keyboard chocolates that I have for things that I was finding myself doing a lot

**03:04:49** To kind of help me out with some window management stuff moon comes with a bunch of presets and it's also really easy to make them

**03:04:55** You basically you have like a tile and you just draw the amount of space you want each window to take up

**03:05:01** It's very simple. You can also save like

**03:05:05** Presets of window arrangement in the application as well. Um, I found it to be very simple very powerful

**03:05:12** And I I really like it

**03:05:15** Yeah, i'm just gonna second this as uh

**03:05:18** Another one of these kind of apps like if you don't use something like this, you don't know what you're missing out on

**03:05:25** My version of this is divvy, but they're the same like there's a bunch of apps that do this kind of thing

**03:05:29** And if you haven't used your computer with a window manager like this

**03:05:34** You really are just like you don't know what you're missing

**03:05:36** The thing that I do which i've really settled on that works great for me for everything that I do

**03:05:41** Is divide the screen into roughly fifths

**03:05:44** So there's like the left hand side there will be an app that takes up like actually is it fifths or is it sixths?

**03:05:51** Or is it seven?

**03:05:53** Yeah, i was just like wait a minute

**03:05:55** I was just i'm just like counting five and I realized like oh that actually doesn't work. No, it's divided into one two three four

**03:06:02** Five oh it's divided into six. Yeah, there we go

**03:06:05** So I have something that's like two six on the left hand side

**03:06:10** Three six so about a half of the screen in the center

**03:06:13** and then like one sixth all all the way on the other side of the screen and like

**03:06:19** That little arrangement is fantastic for me in terms of

**03:06:23** I can have two things that i'm working on that are pretty big

**03:06:25** Although one of them is slightly bigger and then there's a little strip for everything. That's like the status of what's going on

**03:06:32** So i'll leave like omni focus on that little strip or timer on that little strip or like right now skype is and uh

**03:06:38** Like quick time recording the audio or in that little strip

**03:06:41** Being able to just move stuff around with keyboard commands on the screen into whatever works best for you in terms of sizes and ratios

**03:06:48** Like you just have to have this on your computer. It's just just required

**03:06:51** It took me a while to be sold on it, right? Like I was like, I don't need this. I don't need this

**03:06:55** I know everyone thinks the same thing. They're like, I don't need it. How much better it is is it actually and and like

**03:07:00** I think when I get a new computer

**03:07:03** That might be one of like easily the first three apps that I put on there like I need this immediately

**03:07:11** I'm just noticing that like the next thing that was on my list is tide guide which again

**03:07:15** Where might I have been when I needed to know where the tides are that remind us list is paying dividends for you

**03:07:23** Yeah, it really is

**03:07:24** If you're in a place where the tides really matter like say I don't know the middle of the pacific ocean

**03:07:30** There's a ton of tide apps tide guide heads and shoulders above the rest. It's beautiful

**03:07:36** Good, isn't it? Yeah, it's crazy nice

**03:07:40** You never knew that you could want so many options for how and when you're displaying the tide

**03:07:46** But it's like man. This is a thing that I totally wanted and like it really matters depending on where you are. It's just like

**03:07:53** Obviously the best version of this. So yeah tide guide for tracking tides

**03:07:58** I'm gonna go with

**03:08:00** sticker drop

**03:08:01** next so

**03:08:03** iOS 16 added that feature of being able to like tap and hold on somebody and you can drag them out, right?

**03:08:09** It's object detection is what they are and you can drag those images out and like do I don't know do something with them

**03:08:15** Sticker drop is an app that lets you drag and drop people or things

**03:08:20** Into this app and make them iMessage stickers. Oh, nice

**03:08:25** It feels to me like really the only good use of that new feature in iowa 16

**03:08:29** Like I have not found a good use for it

**03:08:31** Otherwise, but this is like this way your friend sends you a picture and they've got kind of a funny look on their face

**03:08:38** You can now take that and use it as a sticker and send it to them forever

**03:08:42** And this is what me and some of my friends have been doing recently and sticker drop is so good

**03:08:48** That's cute, yeah that that is an actual nice use for that feature

**03:08:51** You have an image that becomes a meme in a friend group, which we also have now instead of sending the image each time

**03:08:57** You can send it as an iMessage sticker like attach it to an image

**03:09:00** It's really good and it's revived iMessage stickers for me again. There's a thing that I care about

**03:09:06** Uh, i'm gonna group three things together because they're basically the same thing. They're the apps brain.fm

**03:09:13** Pizzzzz

**03:09:14** Pizzzzz

**03:09:17** Pizzzzz, I guess this is like an old Pizzzzz is an old school like

**03:09:21** app that I remember from a long time ago of like a

**03:09:25** Sleep timing app kind of thing. It was all about sleep

**03:09:28** Yeah, I think they had I think when they started they had a bigger sleep focus

**03:09:32** And portal is the third one which is like white noise sounds i've mentioned them before but i'll just i'll mention them again

**03:09:37** like they're the first two are different versions of like

**03:09:40** auto generated music while you're working and the last one is just kind of like

**03:09:45** Sound scapes to have on in the background and I just use these a lot

**03:09:49** The music in the two is is a little bit different which is why like depending on what i'm doing if i'm like

**03:09:55** Reading I tend to use pizzizz or pizzzzz and if i'm working I tend to use brain.fm

**03:10:02** and

**03:10:02** On ios, they both work great with portal so you can have like a background of ooh

**03:10:08** there's some like forest sounds and then you have the music that's a layer on top of this and

**03:10:15** A lot of times when i'm working or if i'm reading

**03:10:17** I'm using some combination of those three to just be listening into the in my headphones

**03:10:23** And it really does help keep you focused. It's like just to have something to listen to

**03:10:28** That's not as distracting as as even um, like melodic music. It's just like a soundscape in the background

**03:10:35** I use those three a lot really like them. Yeah

**03:10:38** This is this is like a real blast from the past for me pizzizz is 16 years old it used to be wow

**03:10:44** A hardware device it's pre iphone. Obviously. I didn't realize that huh?

**03:10:49** I'm gonna recommend locket locket is a widget

**03:10:53** It's a widget for ios

**03:10:56** And the idea is you use locket to send pictures to loved ones

**03:11:02** So you open the app and you can take a picture of something or yourself

**03:11:06** And send it to someone and it appears in the widget on their home screen

**03:11:11** So automatically we'll update and show them that oh

**03:11:15** Okay, huh, this is an adorable app me and idina use it we send funny pictures to each other

**03:11:21** And it's just like a little treat, you know

**03:11:22** Maybe every day every couple of days a new image will pop up on my phone that she sent me

**03:11:27** I really love this application

**03:11:29** And I think it's like great for like friends and loved ones and that kind of stuff

**03:11:32** You can send people little fun things every now and then it's added a bunch of features over time

**03:11:38** Like you can add little emoji reactions every month

**03:11:40** It makes a little video for you of the things that you've sent back and forth

**03:11:44** You can send little messages to each other. You can save the images

**03:11:47** It really is a great little app and you can send the little locket images to everyone that you share lockets with or certain people

**03:11:54** Or certain groups. It's really cool. Really really great app. So it's a really cute idea and it's a very cute name for it

**03:12:00** Yeah, yeah

**03:12:02** That's a really adorable concept for something to do. I like that. That's that's really cute

**03:12:06** Okay, so this is really dumb, but there's two like apple apps

**03:12:09** I just want to highlight because they have like minor features that people might just not realize

**03:12:14** So we recommend the find my app in the lightning round

**03:12:17** Okay, and i'll give apple some help. Yeah, you know what?

**03:12:20** I mean, they need some i'm gonna give them some help

**03:12:22** But but it is a thing where you know how you're like, oh you're a city mapper evangelist

**03:12:27** I feel like i've become a kind of evangelist for find my when people don't use air tags

**03:12:33** It's like listen to me. You don't understand how absolutely life-changing it is

**03:12:39** If you stick an air tag on like everything you might ever care about and then

**03:12:45** Don't ever look for your wallet again. Your default position should be

**03:12:50** Open find my app and where is it or like where are my keys or where where is it? Like I put air tags on like

**03:12:56** everything and

**03:12:58** It's so nice when like I go to look for something and if I can't find it instantly

**03:13:04** it's like that find my app is open immediately and

**03:13:07** This like lots of things like moon and other things we've talked about it falls into the category of people think

**03:13:13** How nice is it really it's like no it's life-changingly nice. You don't understand

**03:13:18** Like it seems like it shouldn't be a lot more effort, but it's great

**03:13:22** It's like I think the most life-changing thing for me was buying those new apple air pods that like can now track the case

**03:13:30** And and to and to me this is one of these things where it's like

**03:13:34** How did I live before I could just find where that goddamn case? I've used it multiple times already

**03:13:41** I love the new air pods, bro. I love it. Yeah people you should use it

**03:13:47** It's so nice and I just want to call out a little thing

**03:13:50** It's an annoyance that got fixed in the workouts app

**03:13:52** But i'm just going to mention it here because again, it's like you might not have used it for this reason

**03:13:56** Workouts have this dumb thing where if your tracking walks, it would always like update you of like hey

**03:14:02** You've walked every mile and didn't you want to know that i'm always like no apple. I didn't so in the workouts app

**03:14:09** You can now set a bunch of custom workouts and one of the things you can do is tell them like

**03:14:14** Never notify me about this. I don't want to know what my splits are. I don't want to know when it's been a mile

**03:14:21** And it's a hidden feature, but I don't know where else to call it out here

**03:14:24** like you can set up a custom workout and then just

**03:14:28** Don't turn on any of the notifications and i'm so happy about this because

**03:14:33** Every morning when i'm at my treadmill desk and i'm walking and i'm writing my scripts

**03:14:38** You know what? I don't want to know. Hey, you just went a mile. Yeah, shut the up

**03:14:42** I'm working like I don't care

**03:14:44** Uh, and it was like it was so maddening. So anyway workouts app they can finally allow you to turn off notifications

**03:14:53** I'm gonna recommend else when

**03:14:55** Again, I spoke about this last time but I love this app and it's continue to get better over time

**03:15:00** It is an app that gives you discord time codes and time zones that you can paste into other apps

**03:15:06** So in discord, you can add these codes these strings in that give relative time. So

**03:15:12** You add this code in like a string of numbers and letters

**03:15:16** into

**03:15:17** The app is not explained as well

**03:15:19** But it's complicated for me to explain and then if when it formats in the message view for everyone to see it shows them

**03:15:26** The time in their own time zone, so it's all relative stuff

**03:15:31** Which is very cool

**03:15:31** If you want to say such and such thing is happening at four o'clock on thursday

**03:15:36** For you and it might be 9 a.m

**03:15:38** For someone else 12 p.m for someone else no matter where they are in the world

**03:15:42** They'll see in their local time. This is really good if you run any kind of discord community

**03:15:48** Also, I use it as a way to you can you can in the app say like put in a time and date and it can give you some

**03:15:54** Pre-formatted flags and time zones that you can copy and paste onto social media or something like that

**03:16:00** It got a great new design in the past year. So it's really easy to get these codes very quickly

**03:16:06** I really love this app. I think it's super smart super well made and

**03:16:10** Meet something that I find really useful that I wouldn't have been able to do otherwise like there is a way to calculate

**03:16:17** Yourself the way that these codes work in discord, but it is unbelievably complicated for me to work it out

**03:16:24** So I really really like it

**03:16:26** I think it's super smart and it's an app that I recommend people check out if they spend time in discord

**03:16:32** Just looking at my list I was like I've got diffusion beyond here

**03:16:36** Like if you want to see a preview of the end of the world you can play around with this ai art app

**03:16:41** um

**03:16:45** We've talked about that plenty this is another like re-up one but it's a little app teeny tiny app it's for your watch

**03:16:52** It's just called better day. It's a different way to display calendars in the complications on your watch

**03:16:58** It wasn't working for a while and then the developer updated again, and I was so happy like oh great

**03:17:03** I can put this on here. I mainly love it because on my

**03:17:06** Work watch face. I like to have a little dial that counts down the whole year

**03:17:12** So it just shows me a little progress bar of like here's how much of the year is left

**03:17:17** Super tiny, but it's just something I really like to have on the watch. I have two more

**03:17:22** Things they're both made by the same developer and are in the same kind of remit

**03:17:26** Home pass and home paper

**03:17:29** Okay, so as I moved recently i'm kind of rebuilding my home automation stuff

**03:17:37** If you've used any home kit products

**03:17:40** You'll know that like you get these little qr codes

**03:17:43** On the home kit product that you need to scan to like add it to home kit

**03:17:48** And if you've ever say like set up a smart plug

**03:17:51** You've put it in and you've put some furniture in the way

**03:17:53** If something ever goes wrong with that smart plug and you want to re-add it to home kit

**03:17:58** You've got to get to the code

**03:18:00** To scan it to re-add it to home kit again

**03:18:04** What home pass does is an app where you can categorize all of your products

**03:18:09** You can scan the qr code. It pre-fills it with the number and then you basically have

**03:18:14** effectively a database of all of the smart home devices that you have in your home and it actually uses home kit

**03:18:21** To show you what you've got so you can tap it and add the code

**03:18:24** It's like it looks at what's in your home as well, which is very smart

**03:18:28** So you can make sure you've got everything categorized because it would be like oh you haven't added this thing yet, which is very clever

**03:18:35** And then so once you've got that in the future if you ever need to add something to home kit again

**03:18:40** You can grab the code from there or you can it's on multiple devices

**03:18:44** You have an ipad you can use the ipad to bring up the qr code and scan it with your iphone

**03:18:49** It's just a way of dealing with the inevitable time where you have to re-add something to home kit

**03:18:54** Which is buried under a piece of furniture such a pain in the ass. This is a great recommendation

**03:18:59** So it was one of those things where I thought now i'm starting from scratch

**03:19:03** I'm going to make a point of adding everything to home pass

**03:19:08** So i'll save myself like future mic is going to be saved a problem here. Yes

**03:19:14** And then home paper so you can set

**03:19:17** Warpapers in home kit for your house in each room the options app will give you all kind of sucks

**03:19:23** Yeah, they're terrible. Oh bad and using images which you can choose your own images is too

**03:19:29** Noisy, right because it's like full color or whatever

**03:19:33** Home paper is an app that lets you use images of each room or whatever you might want

**03:19:40** But they do it in like a monochrome way as like a monochrome filter to the image which you can then customize with color

**03:19:48** And also it prioritizes the image you're choosing in the top right hand corner, which is typically not used by home kit

**03:19:56** Nice, right. So it will let you create your own wallpapers of rooms in your home

**03:20:02** So you can at a glance more easily

**03:20:05** Understand which room you're looking at in home kit as you're scoring through very clever. Nice

**03:20:11** All right. I'm going to finish off then with

**03:20:13** quitter

**03:20:14** which is a a little app by marco that I really like and

**03:20:20** Quitters for your mac it sits in your menu bar and you can just tell it to add a little rule to

**03:20:27** If I haven't touched an app on my desktop in a certain amount of time either hide it or quit it

**03:20:35** And I love this. I love this for

**03:20:38** Keeping my computer neat and tidy and it's also just so nice when

**03:20:44** It kind of like resets my work computers to a nice default state every morning when I go to them

**03:20:51** So it's like hey

**03:20:52** I can hide all of the stuff or I can quit stuff that I haven't used and it's just like it

**03:20:57** It feels like it's my computer tidying itself up automatically

**03:21:02** And it's just it's such a simple thing

**03:21:05** But it makes a real difference in the quality of life for using my computer. So

**03:21:10** Quitter to automatically close or hide stuff that you're not using love it. So let's use that to close this episode

**03:21:17** Yes, that was state of the apps of 2023. So, you know what's next now?

**03:21:22** Yes

**03:21:23** yearly themes comes themes

**03:21:25** It's theme time. So
