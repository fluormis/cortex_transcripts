# Cortex - 136: 2023 Yearly Themes
**00:00:00** Final episode of the year.

**00:00:02** That happened quickly. Yes. You know what? I agree with you. It's yearly themes time. Yearly themes.

**00:00:08** I actually made a change in my theme within the short break that we just took. So we were talking before and

**00:00:16** We took a 10-minute break and I looked at it. I was like, let me just change a couple of words

**00:00:21** So like we're going right to the wire on this year's theme

**00:00:23** I thought I was taking it right to the wire because I had decided on my theme

**00:00:28** Quite a long time ago as I will reveal and just in the last couple months

**00:00:33** I was like, oh no, I need to go in a different direction

**00:00:35** And I thought that was cutting it close

**00:00:37** But you're cutting it close as in you made a change five minutes ago

**00:00:41** So the theme is the same and I came to my idea of my theme a little bit ago, too

**00:00:46** but in

**00:00:47** Kind of going over the show notes and re-listening to some of the past episodes

**00:00:52** I realized that the way I was talking about my theme was maybe going to be a little more restrictive

**00:00:59** Than what a theme should be. Okay, and so that was really good for me to go back over again

**00:01:04** Which is why it is very good that we in each episode of me to do it again kind of restate what a yearly theme is

**00:01:11** Mm-hmm. I think it's good to kind of have that framing fresh when you're working on one because

**00:01:17** Literally watching your theme video again in preparation for this. I was like, oh I have

**00:01:22** Boxed myself in a little bit too much of this theme

**00:01:24** You'll understand a little bit later on in today's episode why so a yearly theme

**00:01:31** Instead of setting New Year's resolutions at the start of every year because that you will undoubtedly fail

**00:01:38** With a yearly theme you're setting yourself an overall idea of how you want to approach each year

**00:01:45** Then this becomes a guide for you in your personal life your professional life, whatever it might be throughout the next year

**00:01:51** So instead of setting yourself a specific goal

**00:01:54** So something more broad so a good example from Grey's theme video

**00:01:58** Which I'll put in the show notes if you want to watch that instead of saying I want to read 20 books this year

**00:02:04** Which is a very kind of typical New Year's resolution kind of thing you say

**00:02:09** 2023 is the year of reading so if you read 18 books 19 books, that's a success, right?

**00:02:15** Something broad for you to keep in mind helps you make decisions in your year

**00:02:19** Because you've always got this kind of like guide that will kind of help pull you through

**00:02:23** Yeah

**00:02:24** And and the thing that I always like to throw in here

**00:02:26** Which is me at my maximum hippiness is you're looking for words that resonate with you as you think about what your theme should be

**00:02:34** You're looking for this difficult to pin down. But what words are you drawn to?

**00:02:39** Yeah, sort of aspect of resonance and that is incredibly vague always as an actionable item

**00:02:45** But I do feel like that's an important part of this that it's it's broad and what you are drawn to

**00:02:51** I think you have actually in that you have perfectly described a thing that happens to me when I'm working on my theme

**00:02:58** So I spoke about this a couple of months ago

**00:03:01** but what I do when it comes to time for me to think about how I come up with my theme is

**00:03:06** I create an Apple note and I start writing down things that I

**00:03:11** Want to change in my work and personal life or things that I want to continue from the previous year or bring back that kind

**00:03:18** Of stuff and I will just out for a space of a few weeks

**00:03:22** Just keep it in mind that if I have a little thought rather than just having that thought I write it down

**00:03:27** Right and I end up with this long list of things which I then start to go through I delete things

**00:03:33** I move things around I start to see where maybe there are some

**00:03:38** Groups of things forming like oh, this is related to this and this and this and as I start reading through it when it comes

**00:03:44** Like naming my theme that's where it starts to come from

**00:03:46** I get start to get these words popping out and then one of them will just hit and I can't get rid of it

**00:03:53** It's like this year like my yearly theme. I

**00:03:57** Don't think it is maybe the best word that I could have used for it

**00:04:01** But it's the word that I couldn't get out of my head

**00:04:04** Right. So it's the one that I'm going with and so this this process of writing down and reviewing what I'm writing

**00:04:09** It helps me kind of like focus in on what is the biggest thing that I can focus on over the next year?

**00:04:15** That might help me try and tackle some of these annoyances in my life

**00:04:19** Yeah, and I've actually stolen that from you a little bit this year

**00:04:22** nice this sort of way that you've talked about it has gotten into my head and in the past few months

**00:04:27** I've done the same thing of kind of

**00:04:29** Noticing when I'm thinking about something and then particularly when I'm kind of feeling a certain emotion and then writing it down and then kind

**00:04:36** Of processing that and I've totally stolen that from you and it actually has had a big impact on

**00:04:42** The sort of change in what I wanted to do for this year. It works for me

**00:04:46** I mean, I'm happy that it seems to have worked for you for this one because I think you know

**00:04:51** Really what we're trying to do here is make our lives better, right? That's what this is all about

**00:04:56** It's like making our lives better

**00:04:57** And so why this part of the like coming up with the theme works for me is I feel like I'm trying

**00:05:04** Because I'm noting all the things that I don't like the things that I want to change

**00:05:07** Yeah

**00:05:08** And then I'm using those as like how do I build something out of this to try and make this better and maybe make me feel

**00:05:14** Better make me happier more productive. Whatever it might be. Yeah, I think of it as you want to make your life better and

**00:05:22** Intrinsically that is connected to changing something about yourself and that is very hard. I think people underestimate

**00:05:30** That this is like a top tier

**00:05:33** human experience difficulty thing is

**00:05:36** Changing something about yourself is really hard

**00:05:38** And so that's where I think the resonance is important

**00:05:42** It's like it has to be something that sticks in the back of your mind

**00:05:47** That then as you turn on can start to connect to a bunch of different aspects in your life in various ways

**00:05:53** But yeah, it's really hard to improve yourself

**00:05:55** And I think that that difficulty of being able to change something in your life is why something like a fixed goal

**00:06:02** Like a resolution is so hard to achieve. Oh, yeah

**00:06:05** Yeah, because you have to do so much to get to that point

**00:06:09** Where this idea that we have of yearly themes is

**00:06:14** More about just a trend line going in the right direction

**00:06:18** so even if you just do the smallest amount if you've actually been able to get

**00:06:24** Somewhere towards this year theme that you have for yourself if you've been able to you know

**00:06:30** Read three more books this year then you would have otherwise like you have done it

**00:06:35** Yeah, there's something I've been kind of adding in my thoughts to the theme which is going to come up this year

**00:06:39** which is the idea of the

**00:06:42** Minimum possible success like what is the tiniest version of what success looks like and

**00:06:50** this really came out for me of

**00:06:52** exercising a few years ago of like what is the

**00:06:55** minimum amount of exercise that can possibly happen and it was literally

**00:07:01** Five minutes in the morning five days a week was like the bare minimum amount of exercise and like that was totally

**00:07:08** Life-changing being able to do that and so you know like oh, I'm gonna get super fit this year

**00:07:13** It's like okay. Hey, hey if it's a year of fitness

**00:07:15** What is the bare minimum of success look like if you're if you're setting anything that looks like a goal

**00:07:21** It's got to be like way low in what you're trying to achieve

**00:07:24** And I think that's actually more effective then because even small changes going along with this trendline thing are a really big deal

**00:07:33** Over a long period of time because like ultimately

**00:07:37** what I'm trying to do here is is trick my brain in some way and

**00:07:41** I find that having a theme tricks my brain in a really good way because even if

**00:07:48** Everything else around me is on fire if I can

**00:07:52** So like we'll use the year of structure, which I'm gonna talk about in a bit. That was my last year's theme

**00:07:57** You know, I wanted to make sure I had more time for myself, right?

**00:07:59** And even if I was having a terrible week a terrible day

**00:08:04** If I could take 25 minutes to play some video games, I felt like I was

**00:08:10** Doing what I set out for the year. Mm-hmm, which was to give myself some more space and so like

**00:08:17** Doing things like that. It's just

**00:08:19** Now when I play the video games like oh, no, this is I'm not wasting time

**00:08:24** This is what I'm supposed to be doing. Mm-hmm

**00:08:27** Because this is something that I identified that I wanted from my year

**00:08:30** So like you you're able to

**00:08:32** If you can really get this and you can get this idea in your mind and you sat out

**00:08:37** With all of the best intention in the world to try and make some kind of like change in your life

**00:08:42** Around your yearly theme every small amount that you put towards it gets you closer

**00:08:48** To making it a bigger part of your life and I know from the years past who've been doing this

**00:08:53** I'm still carrying through change that I made then yes

**00:08:58** Yeah, because there are certain things stick around and they're just always a part of me and

**00:09:04** This is genuinely some of the biggest change I've made in my adult life is is sticking by this process

**00:09:10** and

**00:09:11** I think it's been incredibly valuable and it's I genuinely believe in it so much

**00:09:15** Which is why we keep doing it right because we both believe in this and it is such a great system

**00:09:21** For brains that work like ours, I suppose. Yeah, and so I hope that for the listeners with this episode

**00:09:28** we're gonna go through review how things went and talk about the themes for the next year and

**00:09:33** I hope that this can act as a way for the listener to

**00:09:38** See and think about like how are other people doing this and to act as like a kicking off point

**00:09:45** For how can this work in your life? So that's what we're going to do today

**00:09:49** And so let's hear about how did the year of structure go Mike? Oh, you want me to start, huh? I do want you to start

**00:11:44** I thanks to Squarespace for the support of this show and all of Relay FM

**00:11:49** I'll give my little description. So every year I have the name of my theme, which was the year of structure

**00:11:55** I have a short description a detailed description and then a set of ideal outcomes

**00:12:01** Some of this has found its way into the structure of the journal, right?

**00:12:05** This is like this is how I ended up doing it

**00:12:07** So the year structure was I need to have a better structure in place to handle my various

**00:12:14** responsibilities while also allowing for more unstructured time

**00:12:18** I want to make space in my life while also balancing the things I want and need to be working on

**00:12:24** Before I started going through this I had a very similar experience and feeling to how I felt last year. So

**00:12:31** With last year's theme when we sent down to do the episode. I was coming in and being like this is a total failure. I

**00:12:39** Didn't do a good job at all

**00:12:40** But and and when the more we mean you went through it together

**00:12:44** It was it was like actually, you know what?

**00:12:47** It it worked out like I did a good job in the end, right?

**00:12:52** And so and that was the year of reinvention, which was again in hindsight a really big thing

**00:12:58** I think that was my biggest issue is it was very big

**00:13:01** So but you know as I was thinking about how was the year structure being for me?

**00:13:05** Psych, oh this was maybe not great and just because I felt like I had I was still struggling with a bunch of new things

**00:13:14** you know coming into 2022 I felt like I'd kind of lost control of the responsibilities that I had in my life and

**00:13:22** 2022 itself has not necessarily gotten better in that regard

**00:13:26** Because it has been a very tumultuous again year for my relay FM work lots of new things happening

**00:13:34** unexpected things happening

**00:13:36** New areas of responsibility that I didn't even really think about before

**00:13:40** New areas that needed to have more intense focus than they did before

**00:13:45** So, you know coming into the review of this I was like, I don't really think I

**00:13:50** Did this like I still feet have this feeling of overwhelm in places?

**00:13:55** But then the more I started digging into it again

**00:13:58** The better I actually thought about it because it took the review for me to realize a lot of the change that I've made

**00:14:04** so

**00:14:06** With the structure of my life. There were four key areas that I wanted to focus on

**00:14:12** Sometimes my yearly themes are just focused on work

**00:14:15** But this one was much more of a holistic thing. So I wanted to bring more structure to my home

**00:14:22** my studio my family and my business and

**00:14:26** As I was going through all of this

**00:14:29** I actually do feel like I have made meaningful progress in each of these areas

**00:14:33** But it may have been in some cases just not necessarily what I thought they were going to be

**00:14:37** Right and so like I feel like I've made success. So the home one we've moved

**00:14:43** Right. This was the big thing and I actually think that the the home move

**00:14:47** Has been the big destabilizer in my life over the last six months

**00:14:53** Let me say as an outside observer of your life

**00:14:56** Yeah

**00:14:59** Hugely to stabilizing it's been really really hard and and it was a lot of horrible work and uncertainty

**00:15:06** And and I think that it cast a bit of a shadow over everything. It totally did

**00:15:11** Yeah, which is why when I was coming in for this review, I think I was I was looking at it more harshly

**00:15:16** But now we've actually completed the move. It's like excellent. This was what we wanted

**00:15:22** We're where we wanted to be we have what we were looking for and huge success for the studio

**00:15:28** This is my much longer

**00:15:30** Process of like, you know at some point in the future

**00:15:33** I would like for me to have my own studio space not one that I rent

**00:15:38** because I want to have more control over the building and I want to have more control over what I can and can't do here and

**00:15:44** I started like laying the foundation of the processes from an accounting and business perspective

**00:15:51** To try and mean that maybe in five years from now I could think about it. That's kind of where I am

**00:15:56** So I feel like again, even the foundations are not finished

**00:16:00** Right, I started the process of like what I would need to do

**00:16:05** To even start thinking about that in my family life like really the move was a big part of this

**00:16:12** I want to put new roots in to into a new part of London and

**00:16:17** Start building up again from there and I'm gonna come back to the family stuff

**00:16:22** Shortly, I think it's gonna become part of my next team and then with business. I'm very confident with

**00:16:29** Relay FM's current position which again has been like every year in the last three years

**00:16:34** Who knows right like it's kind of been a there have been points in the year

**00:16:38** but right now I'm feeling very good about where we are and

**00:16:42** I'm also feeling really good about cortex brand. I think we're on a good path

**00:16:46** I will come back to this in a second like we've got to go make that path happen

**00:16:50** But now I think that we in 22. I think there's much more structure than we had before

**00:16:56** Yeah

**00:16:56** I think this is one of those funny things for

**00:16:59** Outsiders where it will seem like not a lot has happened with cortex brand

**00:17:03** But it's it's just like you you're not aware of the things that have been going on behind the scenes

**00:17:08** It became a real company right? Like yeah, we were kind of like I felt like operating out of the back of a truck before

**00:17:16** now if you've like got

**00:17:18** Things in place that real businesses need like and we're starting to build from there

**00:17:24** Yeah, yeah, you put you have put in a ton of work with getting that set up as a proper thing this year

**00:17:30** So yeah, it's I think people will see the the fruits of that come but I can also understand why

**00:17:36** From your perspective when you're doing the review, it's easy to feel on a bunch of these levels like oh

**00:17:41** Nothing has really happened, but it's like I disagree with that especially with that one with the family

**00:17:46** It's like yeah that home move is a huge like huge deal. That is the foundational thing

**00:17:51** This is the structure part. Yeah, like the structure is a foundation, right?

**00:17:54** And like and I've put in all of the in each of those areas

**00:17:59** I'm confident about what I've put in yeah, but there was the secondary feeling of like, oh my god

**00:18:05** I'm overwhelmed and that hasn't gone away and that is what I'm gonna spoil is focus on again

**00:18:11** Next year in a different way. So to continue my 2022 review. I

**00:18:17** Said on our last episode

**00:18:19** We're gonna have three new cortex brand products in 2022. Right? This is an achievable goal

**00:18:26** This was not

**00:18:29** Not achievable no

**00:18:32** We haven't not been doing anything. So we have had a one of those new products has been available

**00:18:38** It's been available in limited quantities over the last year and we've not spoken about it on the show because the quantities are really limited

**00:18:44** Every now and again, we have a version of a pen available on our store

**00:18:48** We work with our friends at Studio Neat. They make a wonderful pen called the mark one and we've been doing a branded version of that

**00:18:55** When you're on Cortex merch comm sometimes it will be there. Sometimes it won't be there

**00:19:00** You can put your email address in and be told when they'll be there like there

**00:19:04** We have a like an overall plan that at some point this will be a product that's always available

**00:19:09** But it's complicated to make that happen. So yeah, but it's sometimes there

**00:19:13** Yeah, it's complicated to make this is one of those things where you run into a bunch of supply issues

**00:19:17** and so it's it's also just never made sense to

**00:19:20** Fully promote it because it's always been in little drips and drabs here and this isn't a full promotion event

**00:19:26** I just mentioned it sometimes like if we are fully promoting it, I'll tell you all the specs. I'm not even gonna do that

**00:19:30** I

**00:19:32** One day we will come back to this. Yeah

**00:19:34** I have a whole pitch that I give people about this pen that we're not gonna do here

**00:19:38** You're not gonna hear it right? We're not gonna hear it, but it's like it's funny to me

**00:19:42** I didn't remember that you had set this goal of three new Cortex brand products in 2022 and yes

**00:19:49** Looking back on that knowing all the logistical difficulties that are still working themselves out in the world. It's just it's shocking

**00:19:57** that was a

**00:19:59** hilariously

**00:20:00** Complaceable target and neither of us had the foggiest clue of that at the start of the year

**00:20:04** Well, I mean at one of them was just like there was a fundamental lack of a resource in the world

**00:20:10** I mean we couldn't make a thing like

**00:20:13** Okay, and then we've had another product which is our next big product

**00:20:18** Which has also been in development for?

**00:20:23** 18 months I mentioned it on the last theme episode. I was talking about it

**00:20:29** I was talking about like, you know

**00:20:31** I wanted that I had sat down and like went through a whole thing and we were going through original prototypes in

**00:20:36** This product is made and it's currently

**00:20:40** Waiting at a port

**00:20:42** So at some point next year we will have like our second big product

**00:20:47** Was Cortex brand is how I'm hoping that this is going to go

**00:20:51** but that's been a project which has taken a whole year with

**00:20:57** Weekly trips to manufacturers like we will have a whole story to tell

**00:21:02** Some point in 2023. So do we have three products for sale? No, we had one kind of another one nearly

**00:21:10** Yeah, I feel like we have one point one products. That's how it works with the journal in the pen

**00:21:15** So not so achievable but still making good progress

**00:21:20** The biggest thing was I wanted to find more space in my schedule for unstructured time

**00:21:26** and

**00:21:27** I wanted to do a few things with this

**00:21:28** I wanted to have more time to come up with product ideas and big idea stuff and also time for me and

**00:21:34** What I have been able to find more of is the time for me. I have

**00:21:39** made that the priority

**00:21:41** Because I still didn't have like tons of time. So when I had time, I wanted to focus it on that

**00:21:47** Mm-hmm, and this is I think mainly because in the latter six months of the year if I had large chunks of time

**00:21:54** I was trying to get the house things in order in that time

**00:21:58** one of the biggest changes for me in the year of structure is if I would have been sitting at my desk and

**00:22:06** I've got say 45 minutes before a call or recording or something and I haven't got any

**00:22:12** Task that I particularly want to work on I need to work on I would previously just click around like what's on Twitter

**00:22:21** What's in my email that kind of stuff? Yeah, what I have been intentionally doing is what a great time to go play a video game and

**00:22:29** that has been a

**00:22:31** massive positive change in my life this year like in

**00:22:36** 2021 I

**00:22:39** Felt like I was completely detached from video games. Mm-hmm. I wasn't playing them

**00:22:44** There were you know every game of the year

**00:22:47** candidate I hadn't played them and

**00:22:49** And it was bothering me because I wanted that I love video games

**00:22:54** I always have and I wanted to be more connected to them

**00:22:56** And so like a couple of things happened for me like one was this and also I

**00:23:00** Started listening to a bunch of new podcasts from kind of funny their podcast network

**00:23:04** They they're video games and pop culture is typically where they focus on

**00:23:08** So bringing in more video game content that I enjoyed plus making a priority of

**00:23:15** Playing more video games has been a huge change for me. It started with having an Xbox in my studio

**00:23:23** but where it really gained its legs was getting a steam deck and then just having access to

**00:23:29** Basically anything. Yeah has been

**00:23:33** Awesome and I can play it comfortably and it's interesting because this is like a previous year's theme of building

**00:23:40** Strength in me like that was one of the things like fitness, right?

**00:23:44** Was it was never a actual theme of mine?

**00:23:47** But it would find its way into other themes that I would have when I was thinking about like

**00:23:53** Reinvention it was part of that and for me like I have struggled to virus

**00:23:57** I've spoken about that on the show in the past

**00:23:59** This isn't the case for everyone, but it turned out for me that building a little more strength training into my life

**00:24:06** Has significantly reduced my RSI issues

**00:24:11** So I'm able to more comfortably play video games

**00:24:13** So like there's been this like building up of things just got me to the point where

**00:24:18** I've played a ton of video games this year and I love it and it's been a huge positive impact on my life

**00:24:23** I'm so happy to hear that it is a thing like for years

**00:24:26** I felt I was trying to gently encourage you like hey Mike, you know, just like try the weightlifting a little bit and

**00:24:33** it's

**00:24:35** It sounds ridiculous of like oh, yeah

**00:24:37** You're gonna pump iron to play video games

**00:24:40** But it's like in my experience and in the experience of lots of my friends and colleagues like a tiny amount of strength training

**00:24:47** Can really impact RSI and it's one of those things like I didn't even really

**00:24:53** Notice it at first but at some at some point is like oh my RSI

**00:24:57** Just went away. Yeah, and it's like oh right just a tiny amount of this has really made a big difference

**00:25:04** Like we're not a couple of like jacked muscleheads, right?

**00:25:07** Yeah, two of us say I don't think you would necessarily look at us and be like oh man

**00:25:12** They love their weight training. So that is to say like you don't have to

**00:25:16** Really go heavy on it, but just enough

**00:25:20** I would go so far as to say people would look at us and especially me right now

**00:25:24** Which we'll get to and say those guys definitely don't wait train

**00:25:34** That's why I like I really do I have this weird like crusade about like weight training for nerds

**00:25:40** It's like you don't want to do this

**00:25:42** but it actually directly impacts all of the things that you like and

**00:25:46** If you stop doing it, it makes things worse and yeah, it's not the case for everyone

**00:25:50** But I'm just like I'm so happy that you have experienced this too and that it's like it's really paying dividends

**00:25:56** In all of these ways of just oh with a little bit more strength

**00:26:01** You can use your hands for longer comfortably which impacts everything everything

**00:26:07** You know just having that pain all the time was just very difficult

**00:26:13** Mm-hmm. And so finding a way to remove that has been a fantastic change and then using that

**00:26:18** To be able to bring more fun back into my daily life again. It's just been

**00:26:25** Fantastic. Mmm, the steam decks incredible

**00:26:28** And that has been just great. Like I've just been playing a ton of games and I will say that in doing this

**00:26:36** Being able to take this time to do something for me something that I enjoy

**00:26:42** I think that it

**00:26:44** significantly helped me avoid

**00:26:47** burnout this year

**00:26:48** Which in the summer was I think very close for me to just after having covered I was in a very difficult

**00:26:57** position

**00:26:58** For like there was just a lot going on at work and I was struggling to be able to

**00:27:04** Handle it plus the emotional toll of going through my covered situation in San Jose

**00:27:11** During wwbc week like it was just a not great time

**00:27:15** And it was also some of the worst parts of our house buying

**00:27:19** Like because the house buying process for us started in March

**00:27:23** But really kind of reached ahead in June and that was when it became pretty complicated a lot of those things that will complicate

**00:27:29** Happening while we were stuck in the hotel room in San Jose

**00:27:32** Yeah, I re-listened to the theme episode from last year and it it broke my heart when you mentioned on that episode saying

**00:27:40** Maybe this year I'll get invited to an Apple event

**00:27:45** Like a career highlight goal of like oh this is it and then like I had forgotten that you you had said that on and

**00:27:53** It's like my heart just sank through the floor. No, I'm like, oh

**00:27:57** He doesn't know what future Mike is going to experience. Yes, like just

**00:28:01** Just one of the worst

**00:28:03** Covid experience environments and such like it was just it was like the it was a perfect storm of miserableness

**00:28:10** So yeah, you you had such a such a rough summer with that it was it was awful

**00:28:16** I know that people might listen to this episode and think that I'm like pushing the idea of themes really hard

**00:28:22** But it is because it something that I believe in so much to say that

**00:28:28** When all of this was happening and I was in a pretty tough spot. I looked to my theme

**00:28:34** Added more to it. So in July I

**00:28:37** Added a few things into what my theme was based on what was going on with me at the time

**00:28:42** I started using focus modes to detach more on weekends and evenings

**00:28:47** So like a lot of stuff we were talking about in the last episode

**00:28:51** That was a like how I use my focus modes. That was a direct result of what my summer was like

**00:28:56** I finally let go of editing upgrade because of all of this right like I had

**00:29:04** For like

**00:29:07** July to end of August my ability to edit podcasts

**00:29:14** To record them and edit them was significantly impacted

**00:29:18** Every show I would record I would end it and it fall on my chest was on fire

**00:29:23** hmm, it was really hard for me to just do my work and

**00:29:30** It I had to start facing

**00:29:33** A couple of things really one was that I needed to start letting go of some stuff more than I even thought I

**00:29:41** needed to and

**00:29:43** to I actually started to face the idea of like

**00:29:48** What do you do if you're sick

**00:29:52** You was one person responsible for the income of your family, right?

**00:29:58** Where like I have the kind of job where if I'm not working

**00:30:05** It stops so I started to like face some of this stuff think about some of the stuff more

**00:30:14** It

**00:30:15** reframed some of the importance for

**00:30:19** Cortex brand in the future for me as like a business that could one day

**00:30:24** Just kind of be like its own thing

**00:30:28** Mm-hmm, right that like it is a company that makes these products that people like and it just can continue to make money

**00:30:36** Even if I am not able to focus on it and same for you, right?

**00:30:40** I think both see that as like a thing because otherwise if we can't make content

**00:30:45** What happens? Right? Yeah, and so that was a very difficult thing. I had to start looking at because I had a

**00:30:55** Significant enough bout with covered that my symptoms ran for months after I was technically did not have it anymore and

**00:31:02** I didn't know how long that was going to continue

**00:31:07** And it would also hit me at random times. It was like, okay. I need to again

**00:31:11** What can I look at in my theme? And so it was like, all right, I need to

**00:31:17** Give myself more rest time and be more intentional with that and then also give myself more time back

**00:31:24** By letting go of editing upgrade, which is a thing I thought I would never do

**00:31:28** Yeah, and I've been very happy with the decision

**00:31:31** We work with a great editor who has taken over the show for me and is doing a wonderful job

**00:31:37** Jim Metzendorf we use him for a bunch of projects at relay

**00:31:40** He had it some of my other shows but upgrade was one that I was like very protective of yeah and very

**00:31:46** Understandably that you were protective of you were really careful with the crafting of that edit

**00:31:50** So I'll just say take this in the best possible way that as a listener of upgrade

**00:31:55** I would never have known that a switch happened and that's what I wanted which is exactly what you want

**00:32:00** Yeah, and me and Jim work together

**00:32:02** Were in the handover of that I wanted the show to continue sounding the same

**00:32:07** So he was very gracious in allowing kind of like my

**00:32:11** mixing taste

**00:32:13** To be in that because audio editing if you listen to podcasts from public radio or whatever

**00:32:19** Audio engineering or whatever

**00:32:23** It makes me laugh every time I hear that

**00:32:28** Mike it's public airwaves. Yeah only the highest quality some sounds so that you know, like the audio engineering part

**00:32:34** like how do you want it to sound not necessarily what are you cutting out or keeping in and

**00:32:40** Jim very graciously would allow that to occur

**00:32:42** So they wouldn't ever seem like there was a switch over and I give him my notes and he's any listeners and it's been fantastic

**00:32:48** And it's been really great. And now when that show is done Jason takes it and posts it

**00:32:53** So as soon as I am done with upgrade at like 7 p.m. On a Monday

**00:32:58** That's it now and that's fantastic because I used to leave here

**00:33:03** Between 9 and 10 p.m. Now I leave between 7 and 8 and it's just awesome

**00:33:08** So that's been a great change, but it was born out with something that I feel like I needed to do

**00:33:14** Which was not necessarily what I thought was going to happen

**00:33:18** But I looked at my theme worked out how this could fit within it and move forward of it

**00:33:25** So along with the like giving myself more time I wanted to have less in my calendar like appointment wise

**00:33:32** This didn't really get any better

**00:33:34** Okay

**00:33:34** One of the things with the same was like taking that year to focus on not only just cutting them down immediately

**00:33:40** But what would I put in place for 2023 to cut out more from my calendar? I?

**00:33:46** Haven't really succeeded with this. Hmm

**00:33:50** one of the things I wanted to do was think about if there were any shows that I was going to leave and that

**00:33:56** has not materialized

**00:33:59** Because I

**00:34:02** You can't let go kind of got no. Mm-hmm. At some point I think I'm

**00:34:07** Going to do more of this, but it just isn't the time right now

**00:34:11** That I am making some changes that will have a big impact around

**00:34:17** Frequency and how much time I need to commit to some stuff

**00:34:21** So I can't really talk about that just yet. Yeah impacts of a people. Yeah, obviously, but I am actually confident that

**00:34:30** Going through this this year

**00:34:31** I'm going to feel much better next year about what my calendar looks like because of these changes

**00:34:36** But I haven't actually cut shows out

**00:34:39** Completely so that's something to still work on maybe but it hasn't happened this time around

**00:34:45** Similarly, I wanted my to-do list to be smaller and oh boy that not happen

**00:34:51** One of the things I was thinking about was giving more responsibilities to other people this continues to be an ongoing process

**00:34:57** I'm happy that progress continues to be made a lot of this actually just comes from me

**00:35:03** Rather than like my feelings as opposed to actually giving the work away

**00:35:06** I am continuing to work on

**00:35:10** Trusting people who are good at what they do to just do what they do without me feeling that I have to be involved

**00:35:15** Okay, and I've gotten better at that this year and I'm

**00:35:20** Continuing to work on this as an ongoing thing

**00:35:23** but there is also like a practical part of actually giving tasks of

**00:35:28** Mind to other people. What do you mean by that? It's more sponsorship stuff. Okay, so me becoming

**00:35:35** Continually less involved in that process and the company hmm

**00:35:40** Carrie does a fantastic job better job than me and

**00:35:43** I'm continuing to hand more and more of my parts of that off to her and

**00:35:48** That is the thing that we're continuing to work through. It's a slow moving process

**00:35:52** Don't want to upset that too much. I feel like I spoke about maybe getting an assistant again. That has not happened

**00:36:00** I did not do anything

**00:36:02** I've forgotten about that honestly

**00:36:05** Hey, that's fair, right? This happens to all of us, right?

**00:36:08** You you think like oh, I'm gonna do this this year and then a year later you go

**00:36:12** Oh, I totally forgot about zero memory of that as an idea

**00:36:16** Maybe I mean I still would like to have someone help me out with some more stuff

**00:36:20** But I don't really again, I just don't really think I've got a big enough good enough list of things yet

**00:36:25** So sometime at some time. Yes, but it isn't now. I will I will I said this last year

**00:36:31** I think I'm gonna reiterate it again. You have a bigger list than you think you do

**00:36:36** This is this is everybody's issue. Everybody's like I don't have that much stuff

**00:36:40** But this but this is again like if you can build a relationship of trust with someone else

**00:36:46** You will endlessly find more things for them to do

**00:36:49** I'll be I know that process right because like I hired an assistant who became the vice president of sales at my company, right?

**00:36:55** like

**00:36:57** But it's like I know you can have right here, but you're like, oh I don't have enough to do it's like but you do

**00:37:04** Right. It's starting like right

**00:37:06** It's no different now than it was years ago when you did this for the first time. It's the same thing again

**00:37:12** I will keep this one in my mind

**00:37:14** Okay, it will continue to help me in the future even with my 2023 theme if I was able to do this

**00:37:20** It's just not a thing. I thought about yeah, really at all

**00:37:23** Obviously with the structure one of the big things was setting vacation structure for me

**00:37:29** I wanted to have more time off because I have done a terrible job of it always since i've been self-employed really

**00:37:37** I had a target of 20 days

**00:37:41** By the end of the year I will have gotten to like 15 or 16

**00:37:46** Look, that's not bad. I'm very happy with that. Honestly

**00:37:49** Considering how terrible you've been in the past that's not bad and it would have been different

**00:37:54** But the house move kind of messed it up like we wanted to do more like little staycations and we just did one of them

**00:37:59** So i'm confident that in the future that will occur. I committed to a two-week break. I booked it far in advance

**00:38:07** That was a fantastic thing to do and i'm going to keep doing that because knowing that that two-week break was coming up

**00:38:12** Has been like a great

**00:38:14** Mental barrier for me of like there's this thing coming up and i've been thinking about it for like six or seven months now

**00:38:19** And i've been very excited about it and like so i'm going to keep doing that taking a two-week break at some point in the year

**00:38:25** But then also peppering in smaller breaks. I consider this a big win to have even got 75 of the way to my target

**00:38:33** Because I hadn't done that in years. Yeah. Yeah, you know really the only time i've taken

**00:38:39** More vacation time than this was when I got married

**00:38:42** And that was like my first actual proper vacation i'd taken

**00:38:46** Society at the company where there was like a period of time where I was going to do no work

**00:38:51** And like tell people not to bother me, right and you've been married for how many years now?

**00:38:58** Oh, no, I didn't mean to put you on the spot

**00:39:03** Four four years right there we go

**00:39:05** Four years so yeah, it's been a while since you took some proper time off. Yeah

**00:39:11** How could you do that? You know what I mean? How could you how could you throw out that question?

**00:39:15** How many years have you been married? I'm like that's confidential information. I can't answer that on the podcast

**00:39:20** You know what great answer

**00:39:23** great answer

**00:39:24** so in review of my

**00:39:27** 2022 the key

**00:39:29** thing that I wanted to do was to spend

**00:39:33** The year getting myself ready to have a better structure in place for 2023 and beyond

**00:39:38** You know, I was kind of saying that like this is me setting the table for the next however many years

**00:39:44** and

**00:39:45** We were both talking a lot about 10 years in that episode, right?

**00:39:49** And I think that I got there in a bunch of areas

**00:39:54** There's a lot of things have been laid that I can build on top of

**00:39:58** Especially in those four key places that I mentioned

**00:40:01** I would say that overall I think that I've been successful in my yearly theme even if moment to moment

**00:40:07** I still felt a little bit out of control of some things that were going on

**00:40:11** But it was again another year full of some weird twists and turns

**00:40:17** But armed with my idea of structure like you've got to keep structure in your life

**00:40:22** I think it kind of pulled me through it

**00:40:23** I think one of the key things that I am taking away from the year of structure

**00:40:28** Is that rather than just cutting things out completely if I schedule things better I can have more structure

**00:40:35** So it isn't like just about like oh cutting things out, but being smart are about the way I operate

**00:40:42** And that's where i'm going into 2023. And so we'll get the rest of that a little bit later on in the episode

**00:42:52** new decades

**00:42:54** Dawn again. Yes, that's correct new decades dawn

**00:42:58** again

**00:42:59** Which at the time I I branded as the most nebulous theme ever

**00:43:05** it's interesting listening to you talk about how your year went because

**00:43:11** Obviously because we do this show we have a funny experience where

**00:43:15** setting a theme and

**00:43:17** Working on it and having it throughout the year to think about is really important to both of us

**00:43:22** But because we also do this show

**00:43:25** We tend to not want to talk to each other about it as the year is going on

**00:43:31** Because that would make this episode worse like if I knew how you were thinking about everything

**00:43:36** It's sort of it's sort of better to have it here where we can discuss it

**00:43:39** But listening to you talk about how your year went and having re-listened to last year's episode

**00:43:44** Some years were really aligned and in what we're thinking about and some years were really not and I feel like we've just had

**00:43:51** two really aligned experiences

**00:43:54** Last year both of us were thinking very long term about our themes

**00:43:58** And I was really having the same experience as this episode was coming up as you were of

**00:44:05** I was kind of dreading it because I kept thinking

**00:44:10** Oh this year has gone

**00:44:12** Terribly like this has just been an awful year on a number of metrics

**00:44:17** I think it's fair to say that this is probably the

**00:44:20** second worst year of my adult life and so

**00:44:24** I was really down about it and

**00:44:27** This is also just at the time. We're recording at the end of november

**00:44:31** It's also just tends to be a really super duper busy time for me because of the way youtube works

**00:44:38** You really want to have a video up in december. So i'm always like pressured to try to get that done

**00:44:43** We have our two big episodes of state of the apps and themes which from our subjective experiences

**00:44:50** We're basically like recording back to back almost they're like seven days apart

**00:44:55** And they're both huge work jobs for both of us

**00:44:57** And we've both like relisted to a bunch of the episodes to get ready for this

**00:45:01** And i'm also flying to america in like two days. So it's just snap

**00:45:09** Yeah, it's just been terrible like I was really I was really down like as november was here and just approaching this like oh my god

**00:45:16** I've got so much work to do

**00:45:18** Trying to finish this video. It's the big cortex season. Like I just hate it. I'm so unpleasant and also my year was awful

**00:45:25** like everything sucks, but like

**00:45:28** one of the things that's really

**00:45:31** nice about this time

**00:45:33** Is it also?

**00:45:35** forces me to

**00:45:36** Actually review how the year went to spend some time and sit down and

**00:45:42** Like I look through my theme journal and say like, okay. What was I doing at different times?

**00:45:47** I look at the notes that I make over the course of the year about how things are going or what am I thinking?

**00:45:52** or what am I working on and

**00:45:55** While I will still say that objectively this is not a great year

**00:46:00** It's so much less bad than it was in my mind when I was just kind of

**00:46:06** ruminating on it in this vague way that that you can do if like

**00:46:10** Everything sucks and everything is bad. It's like no no

**00:46:14** February feels like three years ago. What was actually happening then, you know, the summer feels like it was two years ago

**00:46:21** What was actually happening then like go through and see what you were up to?

**00:46:25** So back to the actual theme which was new decades dawn

**00:46:29** I knew that it was a super nebulous theme, but that was kind of on purpose

**00:46:35** so

**00:46:36** for me, it was just about

**00:46:40** Reevaluating my entire

**00:46:42** YouTube career

**00:46:44** that I think after having done it for 10 years there was a strange way in which

**00:46:51** I was distant enough from having been a teacher

**00:46:55** That I kind of just took my youtube life for granted that like oh, this is just the way things have always been

**00:47:03** and part of that was about

**00:47:06** Internalizing that that is not

**00:47:09** True. It's not true that like oh, I just am a youtuber that it's it's a thing that I have to

**00:47:15** Just like I did at the beginning of the decade really think about intentionally

**00:47:21** What am I doing here?

**00:47:23** so I kind of wanted to try to reevaluate youtube with new eyes and

**00:47:29** Stop thinking about how the internet was and instead see how it actually currently is

**00:47:36** What my life currently is

**00:47:38** What does that mean in terms of how I want to produce videos and how I want to go forward long term?

**00:47:45** I didn't say it at the time, but if you go back and listen to that old theme episode

**00:47:50** I think it's very clear that my original intention

**00:47:54** Was always for this to be a two-year theme. I didn't intend for it to be a one-year theme. I thought

**00:48:01** I know going into this it's going to be much more long term than just this one year

**00:48:07** I have adjusted that a bit since but that was the original idea

**00:48:11** So before I just get into the professional stuff, I do want to say like one of the things

**00:48:15** It's it's almost like I kind of forgot about

**00:48:18** But I was also finishing off this year a kind of there was a bit of a sub theme left over from the previous year

**00:48:25** which was about

**00:48:26** Seeing all of the family after having not seen anyone because of covid for a long time

**00:48:32** And I like almost kind of forgot that I spent like nearly a quarter of the year in hawaii year of the voyage, right?

**00:48:39** Wasn't that was like from the previous year?

**00:48:43** Yeah, it happened to be split, you know because we do themes every year

**00:48:46** But like what you'd plan for stuff doesn't hit those borders exactly

**00:48:49** So it was always the like i'm going to spend a bunch of time with my side of the family

**00:48:52** And then we're going to spend a bunch of time with my wife's side of the family

**00:48:55** And it just like it broke up over the two different years

**00:48:58** But those were always planned together as two sides of the same coin

**00:49:02** But yeah, I like already sort of pushed that back of like, oh that was so long ago

**00:49:06** it must have been two years ago and

**00:49:09** there's a big chunk of time and

**00:49:12** I like I don't know if I ever really said it on the show

**00:49:15** but it's important in a year review to

**00:49:18** Say it out loud and internalize it that while it is easy and fun to complain about how

**00:49:24** Unbearable I find many things in hawaii. It doesn't change the fact that

**00:49:30** Just like visiting my side of the family was visiting my wife's side of the family and in particular being able to coordinate

**00:49:37** Getting a lot of people together at the same time in one location

**00:49:43** It was a kind of peak in-law experience that was just good for all of us

**00:49:48** Like I think it was just a great bonding experience for that whole side of the family

**00:49:52** It brought everyone closer together

**00:49:54** It may literally be unique in terms of the difficulty of trying to coordinate whatever it was in the end like

**00:50:01** uh, just just a ton of people rotating in and out but it was great and

**00:50:06** That alone was just a really successful thing to have done this year

**00:50:10** It was kind of nice in the review to go through and go like

**00:50:14** Yeah, that really was a big deal this year getting to the other side of the world and coordinating spending a long time there

**00:50:19** And coordinating family there like it was a big logistical project and it was pulled off hugely successfully

**00:50:25** Even if I find hawaii physically uncomfortable and full of spiders, but like that's you know, that's a different issue

**00:50:31** but yeah, so

**00:50:34** What happened with the rest of my year was similar to your experience that

**00:50:42** It's kind of funny I think in past years whenever i've talked about themes

**00:50:47** I almost always have used the example of health as something that can come up that you don't expect

**00:50:54** And as one of the reasons why goal setting is bad

**00:50:58** That you you never know in a year when like oh surprise your year is actually going to be a year of health

**00:51:04** it's not going to be whatever else you focused on and

**00:51:08** I don't know. I was very

**00:51:11** I

**00:51:12** was very hesitant to

**00:51:14** Talk about a lot of the specifics on the show like we sort of mentioned it

**00:51:19** We discussed it a little bit in more text which was

**00:51:22** Kind of intentional on my part of like oh, I don't want to talk about this in the main show like we but we can talk about

**00:51:28** It some in more text, but yeah

**00:51:31** I was hit way harder for way longer than

**00:51:35** I knew

**00:51:36** And i'll share that from my wife's perspective

**00:51:40** It was for her a bit like living with someone who is a long covet denier who has long covet

**00:51:49** It doesn't exist

**00:51:53** Yeah, I mean like I literally had conversations with her where I was like i've read over this paper about long covet and

**00:52:00** I think there's some serious methodological problems with this even as a concept

**00:52:05** But her experience was that we had a real

**00:52:08** relationship role reversal that went on all year that I was kind of constantly in denial of which is

**00:52:16** Normally, she is the one who is much more over ambitious about whatever the day plans are going to be

**00:52:22** So sometimes when we're talking in the morning, she will tell me all the things that she like here's here's what she's going to do

**00:52:27** Today like boom boom boom boom boom. Here's a list and she will casually have reeled off something. That's like 30 hours of work

**00:52:34** That she's planning to get done. And then i'm the one who sort of talks her down from that and says like, okay

**00:52:40** well, let's

**00:52:41** Realistically, how long do all these things take and and let's do the plan

**00:52:44** and we completely had a role reversal this year of me talking about what I wanted to do and

**00:52:52** She had to constantly talk me down because I was just kind of

**00:52:57** Refusing to accept that what I considered a normal amount of work was not possible

**00:53:03** And I still think I would have been kind of fine if I only got covet the once but it was the second time that just

**00:53:11** Absolutely killed me and really put me down

**00:53:15** and so

**00:53:17** Just like you it directly impacted a lot of my ability to work

**00:53:21** and

**00:53:22** Some of the specifics that I haven't talked about but this was again like going through the data and trying to see you know

**00:53:27** What did my year actually look like because all of this is connected to like i'm really disappointed

**00:53:32** In my video output this year, but when I looked through the data, I realized

**00:53:37** my aerobic ability in

**00:53:39** Across all metrics was just completely f**ked. There's no other way to put it

**00:53:44** and digging through the data I realized oh, I wasn't even really able to

**00:53:50** Consistently use my treadmill desk

**00:53:54** And walk and talk the script out loud until september

**00:54:00** And it's like it's a thing that I knew like I sort of knew that I would go into the office and try to

**00:54:06** Walk and talk a script out loud at the same time and not be able to do it and then just sit down at my desk

**00:54:13** But I totally like I will acknowledge it now

**00:54:15** I was in some kind of weird sort of denial about this of like even now I still kind of think

**00:54:22** Like okay, let me let me be let me be very clear about the sentence internet, right for like everyone listening

**00:54:28** I still kind of think that most long covid might be a mass nocebo effect

**00:54:33** Like there's a part of my brain which is still just whispering that constantly but it's extra funny in my own position because

**00:54:40** For a nocebo to work you have to think that it's harmful

**00:54:45** Which I like refused to do and then still obviously have all of the symptoms

**00:54:51** So like this is almost a self falsifying thought even to think this thought and then look at yourself

**00:54:57** Is makes it obviously not true. Yeah, because if you didn't believe it was possible, but then suffer from it, right?

**00:55:03** Then you can't be yeah, there's like a double negative here

**00:55:05** Which is i'd have to believe that it's harmful to have the symptoms that I don't believe

**00:55:10** Can be harmful right? It's like I know this this thought like annihilates itself

**00:55:14** It's like matter and antimatter in one thought but there's there's still like a part of my brain that just totally holds on to it

**00:55:20** There's a thing that you won't be aware of which is also a way that I kind of tricked myself

**00:55:26** so this is what I mean by like specifically looking at like what was actually the problem and the problem is clearly my

**00:55:33** cardiovascular system, but I was kind of pretending that wasn't a problem because

**00:55:38** Both times I got covid the thing that made it very real for me was oh

**00:55:43** While I had covid I couldn't rank up on magic the gathering. I'm like, oh god

**00:55:48** I'm just like my ranking score is terrible because I can't think straight

**00:55:53** Right, but then after both covids I ranked back up into mythic and I was like, ah, everything's fine, right?

**00:56:03** Someone's gonna write a paper about that

**00:56:06** the long-term ramifications of magic the gathering players between the years of 2020 to

**00:56:11** 2024 yeah for sure like i'm bet there's i bet there's a ton of people who follow that same pattern of like mythic players

**00:56:17** who drop down into like

**00:56:19** Platinum like a noob and can't break out of it

**00:56:21** And then when covid clears up like oh they're ranked back up into mythic

**00:56:24** No problem, but like I really do think there was a way in which

**00:56:28** I used that as a way to kind of convince myself. There wasn't a problem

**00:56:32** It's like oh, I have an actual numerical rank to prove that my brain hasn't got messed with

**00:56:37** And so nothing could have been messed with and it's like, ah, yes

**00:56:41** But you know, you're made of two things a brain

**00:56:44** And the body it lives in and like the body it lives in is having some major problems

**00:56:50** And so yeah when like I kind of thought everything was over in the summer

**00:56:55** but all of my auto tracked activity shows that that was just totally not true and I kind of

**00:57:03** I knew it wasn't true, but I was also just completely in denial about it and

**00:57:09** Again looking through the actual data

**00:57:12** Again mainly through until

**00:57:15** September I had huge periods of time where my movement activity was almost nothing in a day

**00:57:22** That's not normal

**00:57:23** Like i'm just totally not doing well at all or like even things when I was kind of reviewing how my year went I realized

**00:57:30** How many bike rides have I gone on this year? Like I really love cycling around london

**00:57:36** I get a lot of pleasure out of it. Like I think it's such an amazing

**00:57:40** City to explore by bike and it's also a thing that my wife routinely pushes me in to do because she

**00:57:47** She notices in the afternoon of like oh

**00:57:49** You're just kind of sitting around like why don't you go for a bike ride?

**00:57:52** You always come back happier and that's like that's a thing that she's just gotten in the habit of pushing me

**00:57:56** But that didn't happen this year. It's like how many bike rides did I do?

**00:58:00** Oh, the answer was three and then looking at it. I realized oh, right

**00:58:05** After those bike rides like my activity again just dropped to almost nothing the subsequent days of like i'm just not moving around at all

**00:58:12** so yeah, it was a major problem and

**00:58:15** The other thing that I sort of didn't want to talk about but you know because it impacted the show

**00:58:21** Is I was having what I kind of dubbed covid migraines

**00:58:26** which were these

**00:58:28** very long lasting kind of low level migraines

**00:58:33** That constantly threatened to break out into like a full fledged

**00:58:38** Oh god, the world is nothing but pain migraine at any moment

**00:58:42** And I did start to track these because I was a little bit worried about it and it's like I was losing

**00:58:49** maybe

**00:58:50** Two weeks a month to being in this kind of state of having like a constant low level headache

**00:58:56** This is also one of these things that finally november is the first time I haven't had one of these like I can see

**00:59:02** That the the trend has been going down

**00:59:04** So this is one of these funny areas where i'm trying to look through the data and be quite serious about and be like hey

**00:59:10** Okay, listen, listen gray your brain wants to be full of lies about how well you're doing

**00:59:16** So do you have actual metrics to show that you are actually getting better?

**00:59:21** And I do starting in september

**00:59:24** But I like operated under the year of at the start in hawaii i'm like, oh i'm in hawaii and i've

**00:59:31** Recovered from covet and that's gonna be great

**00:59:33** And it's like I still wasn't great and then I got covet again and it's like and then it was really bad

**00:59:39** And sort of related to the thing that I was talking about before

**00:59:43** Not surprisingly with no activity and just such little cardiovascular strength

**00:59:49** It's like all of my exercise basically went away and a little thing that i've noticed is like, oh, right

**00:59:56** Hello rsi

**00:59:58** You've returned of course because i've dropped the strength training because it just wasn't up for it

**01:00:04** I like I just haven't wanted to talk about all of these little details

**01:00:08** I think it's kind of not very interesting to listen to someone talk about this

**01:00:13** But like if we're doing a year review and if I didn't go through this it would just be like

**01:00:20** totally willfully ignoring the most impactful thing that happened to me all year long and

**01:00:27** It obviously had a huge impact on my ability to work and my actual output

**01:00:33** So that's the big thing that happens. It is a super bummer

**01:00:37** but this is also where again i'm glad to have stuff to go through because

**01:00:44** In retrospect

**01:00:46** Looking at the year and seeing okay

**01:00:48** How much time did I have if I estimate how much I was put down by low level migraines and a bunch of other problems?

**01:00:55** Considering the amount of time I actually had to work and the fact that like, okay

**01:01:01** I'm going to have a video that's going up in december. I've got the final audio for that recorded

**01:01:05** So it's in animation. So there's no problems

**01:01:08** Yay, I know

**01:01:09** That's so good. I'm so happy for you

**01:01:11** I'm really genuinely and i'm so happy to hear that

**01:01:15** Yes, i'm extremely happy to hear that as well

**01:01:18** Although it only happened because it had to split a thing into two, but that's a whole other story. Hey, it doesn't matter

**01:01:22** That's the best kind of content, you know what I mean content of doubles. Yeah content the doubles

**01:01:27** Yeah, we'll get to that for my actual theme but

**01:01:30** Considering it's like okay

**01:01:31** I am going to get a video out for december which is like my biggest single stress point in the year and has been making me

**01:01:36** miserable all month

**01:01:37** Considering that my like runways video was basically a kind of two in one or three in one

**01:01:43** It's like it's actually not

**01:01:45** terrible in terms of

**01:01:47** output per available work time so

**01:01:51** It's still not a good year, but I feel a lot less bad about it than like oh

**01:01:57** I'm like i'm just a miserable loser who accomplished nothing. It's like no no a major impactful thing happened and

**01:02:04** all things considered

**01:02:06** Your output per available units of time to work

**01:02:10** Wasn't wildly affected by that. I did have a bit of bad luck in that

**01:02:15** September I took a grecation and I did write a video during this time

**01:02:21** We were kind of talking about this on one of the previous episodes or it's time about like oh

**01:02:24** There's like things the audience want which might make a product worse

**01:02:28** I had written a video. It was going to be like a 20 minute long thing

**01:02:32** But I I made the very difficult decision to

**01:02:35** cut it for style reasons that were sort of related to this of like

**01:02:39** This doesn't fit in with the style. I don't like it

**01:02:43** And so there is a kind of phantom video that was basically finished and that also makes me feel a little better

**01:02:49** Obviously not publishing that doesn't help the business, but it does help in terms of just thinking about okay. I also have another metric for like

**01:02:58** Starting in september things are actually getting better. Yeah, not amazingly fast, but again. It's all about the trend lines here

**01:03:06** and

**01:03:07** Also reviewing the year I had kind of totally forgotten a bunch of the things that I had done which includes

**01:03:15** under the umbrella of

**01:03:17** accepting the reality of youtube

**01:03:20** two projects

**01:03:21** One of which was

**01:03:23** Hey, i'm gonna try out shorts, which is a thing that I did

**01:03:27** It was a total disaster

**01:03:30** But like it was a disaster that I learned from i'm glad I did it and it fell under this category of

**01:03:36** Don't just ignore new things that you're grumpy about

**01:03:39** Actually try them with that one again. I just don't think it works for me for various reasons

**01:03:44** I made two videos. I kind of had a couple more in development and then quickly realized no, this is just awful

**01:03:50** and

**01:03:51** Sharp-eyed viewers will notice that the shorts that we talked about earlier in the year

**01:03:54** Don't even exist on the channel anymore because they were so bad in terms of all of the metrics

**01:04:00** I care about they were actually net negative. So I removed them

**01:04:06** Ah

**01:04:08** What was that big sigh for?

**01:04:10** It just does it so bad, right? Like

**01:04:13** Let me try this thing. Oh, no, it made everything worse. Yeah

**01:04:16** You never know though, right? Like this might be something to come back to again in the future

**01:04:20** Clearly, this is something youtube doesn't want to go away

**01:04:23** And I think you know, there's more about like them doing revenue share and stuff

**01:04:26** It's which is the thing that they're starting to talk about

**01:04:29** Maybe one day it might have a different effect

**01:04:32** But clearly for you right now, this is not a thing to put energy into

**01:04:37** Yeah, yeah, of course as always if if the situation changes like you're dumb if you don't reevaluate

**01:04:41** Of course, but yes, even the things that I have seen that are the optimistic outcomes of that i'm like, oh, this is just awful

**01:04:48** But like I was really glad to have done that the idea of leaning into youtube and being a youtuber

**01:04:53** Which is obviously one of the big things we spoke about. I think you're going to talk about something else in regards to that

**01:04:58** It doesn't mean you need to do everything. Yeah, it does. Yeah, that's exactly right, but you got to try it though

**01:05:02** That's the point. Yes. Yeah, and it's like I had spent

**01:05:06** Years just being like a you know, old man yells at cloud about shorts. You're a youtube hipster. That's what you were

**01:05:12** Yeah, and it was it was worth trying I reserve the right to try it again if the situation changes

**01:05:17** But for various reasons, I just don't expect it will ever really work for me

**01:05:19** But that's also good because it just kind of focuses on okay do the things that you're good at

**01:05:24** The second major thing which again I had just kind of like

**01:05:28** Totally taken out of my brain as this was a major project for the whole year

**01:05:34** was

**01:05:35** Redoing all of the thumbnails and titles for almost every single one of the videos

**01:05:42** There's not complete

**01:05:43** There's a few videos which are either like out of date or just not watched very much that still haven't made it into the rotation

**01:05:50** Of worth spending time on for changing

**01:05:53** But I think like 90 percent of the video

**01:05:56** Thumbnails and titles have been updated and changed over the course of the year

**01:06:00** Now that sounds like it's not a huge deal

**01:06:04** but this was

**01:06:05** a much bigger project than I anticipated because I wanted to set up a bunch of systems for

**01:06:12** Okay, instead of just like randomly changing things around I

**01:06:17** Need to have a system for like which thumbnails am I going to be trying?

**01:06:21** Try to have a record of like what works and what doesn't?

**01:06:24** Oh, if you were to just like change everything all at once that probably messes up all of the data for how anything can possibly work

**01:06:32** So like try to slowly roll this out over the course of the year

**01:06:36** and

**01:06:37** without a doubt

**01:06:40** thumbnails

**01:06:41** Saved my business this year, right? Like in terms of the lack of uploads

**01:06:46** the thumbnails

**01:06:48** and title changes

**01:06:50** acted as though I had uploaded several more videos this year than I did

**01:06:55** And I know that people hate it. They're like, oh my god. Why don't you just keep the same thumbnails and titles forever?

**01:07:01** I always think there's a new video. This is so confusing. I'll get to that in a second

**01:07:05** But it's a funny thing because I thought like do I really need to do this?

**01:07:09** I don't I don't think I do and over the course of the year slowly rotating through everything and working on it with the animator

**01:07:15** And having the whole team do the like hey, can you think of a better title for this which is we've discussed before

**01:07:20** It's like surprisingly hard to do so hard

**01:07:23** So hard to do but doing all of that like is just way more work than I thought it was

**01:07:28** Here's an example of what i'm going to call

**01:07:32** the most effective

**01:07:34** 10 minutes of my entire career

**01:07:38** I don't think i'll ever beat it. This is it like i've peaked in terms of efficiency

**01:07:43** I wanted to

**01:07:44** Update my old video which was about the tcoi test range not the exploring video

**01:07:50** But the video explaining like hey, what was this place that I explored?

**01:07:54** Was that the cgp gray was wrong one? No, not that not the cgp gray was wrong one

**01:07:58** It's the one that that one is correcting

**01:08:01** So if you remember I uploaded the original here's what tcoi was video. Yep, it had the mistake in it

**01:08:08** I made cgp gray was wrong. I took down the old video and then I uploaded a new video

**01:08:13** Yes, tcoi with the correction. Yes, it's actually the video that you wanted to make in the first place

**01:08:18** Yeah, yeah, so this is the one that explains like oh, hey, it's the nuclear subs

**01:08:22** I love the animation that's in there

**01:08:23** That's like there's 20 nuclear submarines and each one has eight missiles and each missile has it has 20 warheads

**01:08:28** It's like a million warheads to destroy the world is that video?

**01:08:32** So it's like I want to update this one

**01:08:34** I couldn't think of a good thumbnail change. I actually quite like the thumbnail, but I did sit down like okay

**01:08:39** What can I do for this video and I will admit this is the most clickbaity title of anything that's on the channel

**01:08:46** But it popped into my head. I was like, oh

**01:08:49** Let me just try something that's kind of clickbaity, but I do think it's legit

**01:08:54** The title was this abandoned shed may yet help destroy the world

**01:08:59** And then that video got four million views in a week

**01:09:05** What was it at before point seven million views

**01:09:09** Wow

**01:09:11** So it went from 700 000 views to 4.7 million views in like a week and let me ask you though

**01:09:19** Right. So you got four million views

**01:09:20** But like was it four million helpful views because you could get four million views, which is someone going click and close, right?

**01:09:27** Yeah, and then that's no good. So part of the like new decades dawn thing is again taking stuff quite seriously

**01:09:34** and

**01:09:35** underlying this conversation about thumbnails is also a

**01:09:39** renewed focus on the behind the scenes statistics of how the videos are doing

**01:09:46** And so one of the things while i'm changing the thumbnails is I was keeping a really sharp eye

**01:09:51** On how is this actually affecting metrics that I care about because that's exactly the thing that's like I don't want right?

**01:09:57** The thing that I was particularly afraid of which if you go buy comments on youtube

**01:10:03** You will think is happening all the time is oh i'm actually just tricking

**01:10:08** Existing viewers to watch the thing and they abandon it immediately

**01:10:12** so one of the things I was trying to avoid

**01:10:15** was

**01:10:16** Making thumbnail or title changes and if what I saw on the back end was

**01:10:21** Oh, there's a bump in viewers, but they're all returning viewers. They're people who already watched this before

**01:10:27** That's a bad one and i'm gonna change that like that's not what I want at all to be the case

**01:10:32** What i'm trying to have is have youtube actually show that to new people and the t-coin one was like

**01:10:39** Comically successful in terms of youtube showing it to new people. I don't remember offhand what the ratio was

**01:10:45** But it was crazy good for like oh, there's a surprisingly few number of existing viewers who are watching this

**01:10:51** and

**01:10:52** Like I think basically youtube with that title change was able to find some

**01:10:58** Subsection of I imagine like urbex

**01:11:02** Enthusiasts or whatever who were just like interested in this video who otherwise would never have clicked on it

**01:11:07** What's that word people who like exploring abandoned structures urban exploration? Yeah, it's cool cool cool

**01:11:13** That's kind of my theory about what happens looking at some of the demographics. I think that might be true as well

**01:11:18** Yeah, so anyway when people are like, all right, I don't want you to change the thumbnails. It's annoying

**01:11:23** I like to roll thumbnails better the thing from this year that hits multiple bullet points is

**01:11:29** Number one because so many of these videos are like eight years old or seven years old

**01:11:34** I didn't really realize just how terrible many of those thumbnails were the number of thumbnails

**01:11:39** I had that were just the title in like block cap letters as the thumbnail itself was surprisingly high

**01:11:48** Why did I do this? It's like oh right because I used to be a one-person team

**01:11:53** and subscriptions used to matter more so the thumbnails just didn't matter at all and so

**01:11:59** Lots of stuff in the back catalog. I was like, oh, this is awful

**01:12:03** Like and I just didn't know like we've got to update these things and it's made a huge difference. I mean like

**01:12:09** Your top videos list now

**01:12:12** Is so incredibly different to this time last year canada and the united states bizarre border?

**01:12:19** 22 million views, you know what like that. Where was that video before like I don't even remember but that's another one that was just

**01:12:26** Bizarrely successful with a slight thumbnail and title change. Yeah, so the t-coi one is again

**01:12:32** That's my most effective 10 minutes

**01:12:34** Like I am never gonna beat that in terms of how effective any single thing is that i've ever done in my entire life

**01:12:40** Yeah, it's like that single moment, but lots of these changing them to make the old ones better

**01:12:46** Keeping an eye on the analytics to make sure that while yes

**01:12:49** There will always be people who are annoyed because they thought there was a new video and they clicked on it

**01:12:53** Making sure that that is not the majority case behind the scenes and that people who are finding this are actually finding it engaging

**01:13:02** Doing that was so good for the channel overall

**01:13:07** That like it's almost unbelievable for me to say the thing that i'm gonna say here, which is so last year

**01:13:12** I had a sub theme which was a billionaire bust as like this is a long-term career goal that I have

**01:13:21** Which is I would like the youtube channel to hit a billion views felt like a real target

**01:13:28** What I just looked at your number

**01:13:30** Yeah, so this year while it has been in terms of uploads

**01:13:34** the worst year since I started youtube i've added

**01:13:39** 160 million views

**01:13:42** Almost entirely by updating thumbnails and titles you crushed it you crushed the theme. I am

**01:13:48** Ahead of schedule for hitting a billion views by like a year and a half

**01:13:54** Even though I had just an abysmal year in terms of actual video production

**01:13:59** So when people go like why do you change the thumbnails?

**01:14:03** This is not an exaggeration

**01:14:05** The business would have been like in financial trouble if I hadn't updated thumbnails and titles this year

**01:14:11** Like that is how much of a difference it made it made such a difference

**01:14:16** That it was more views

**01:14:18** Than many years in which i've uploaded more it was absolutely shocking because the question is right

**01:14:24** I guess you don't know and I would wonder what your gut check is on this

**01:14:29** Like if you continually keep changing the thumbnails of existing videos

**01:14:35** You wouldn't expect to add 100 million a year every year. Would you or would no no?

**01:14:40** So i'm actually feel like this was incredibly good timing in a way that I had this year where I was just

**01:14:45** Really unable to do work, but this is the kind of admin work that I could do and I was really consistent about

**01:14:53** This is an important thing. You need to do this on a recurring basis and

**01:14:59** Again, I think for someone who doesn't have to deal with the youtube backend

**01:15:02** You could think like what's the big deal?

**01:15:03** It's actually like a huge pain in the ass to actually keep track of this like it is a surprising amount of work

**01:15:08** To know if you're doing it right or not. I will never understand

**01:15:11** No one will ever be able to explain to me why I cannot upload multiple thumbnails and they just tell me which one is the best

**01:15:17** Like it's called ab testing

**01:15:20** It is the most simple of testing

**01:15:23** Why can't and they like the system?

**01:15:26** Uh drives me crazy. Yeah. Yeah, don't even don't even get started on that but like

**01:15:30** So it was a surprising amount of work

**01:15:32** But I also think it was well timed for a year when I was just going to be really

**01:15:38** Bad and limited in my time for writing to do this

**01:15:42** because I think it almost perfectly worked out that

**01:15:46** I

**01:15:47** Went through and updated almost everything on the channel

**01:15:51** Basically by september, which is when I started to be able to get back into it somewhat

**01:15:58** Although still a little bit limited working schedule and I think

**01:16:02** 90 percent of the gains that were possible to be made by changing and updating titles and thumbnails has been made this year

**01:16:10** So I I think this was like a one-time effect. Right? I don't I do not think this is an ongoing thing

**01:16:16** I can't keep doing this to hit the billion views and I actually have the data to support that because i'm keeping track of it

**01:16:23** of like, okay

**01:16:24** Each time now i've been changing stuff the pattern is much much less noticeable

**01:16:30** I think that's because so many of my old titles and thumbnails were just legitimately bad and the videos were kind of

**01:16:38** Succeeding in spite of themselves. I was like, hey, what if you did this, but it was good

**01:16:44** You know, like just make the thumbnail better. Will you keep doing it though?

**01:16:48** anyway, well, so I think what this really is more about is

**01:16:54** This has been a year about internalizing and just accepting and stop complaining like a little baby

**01:17:00** About the title thumbnail system on youtube. Like just just accept that this is what this is

**01:17:05** I've had a year of learning what seems to work and what doesn't seem to work on the channel

**01:17:11** Oftentimes it is confusing. You can't be like why on earth does this one work so well, but like whatever I think there's an overall

**01:17:18** General idea of what seems to work. I think if you also just like again sort by popular and look at those thumbnails

**01:17:24** I think there's a kind of consistency to them now, which wasn't so much the case before

**01:17:29** I do think that they're just better

**01:17:31** And so I had been doing it anyway, but I think this is really much just more

**01:17:37** informing the future videos that go up of like how am I going to try to do the titles and thumbnails and

**01:17:44** This is a really important part of the process and that's fine. That's the way the system works

**01:17:50** and

**01:17:51** the other thing that I kind of forgot is

**01:17:55** How I was also taking this and as best I could applying it to the cortex youtube channel as well

**01:18:03** and so

**01:18:04** Frankly for years like I think neither of us had just really thought about the cortex channel very much

**01:18:10** It was just like a thing we have because probably some people would want to listen to it that way and that was true

**01:18:16** There was a number of thousands of people that would listen to every episode on youtube. Yeah, so we just did it

**01:18:22** It just existed there, you know

**01:18:24** We made the decision to bring in like the cortex animated on the official channel

**01:18:29** But I think that was like the only decision we really ever made in terms of like what can we do to make this channel better?

**01:18:36** But this year while I was working on my own channel

**01:18:39** I have spent more time on the cortex

**01:18:42** backend that in all of the previous years combined by a factor of 100 and

**01:18:48** Doing the same thing doing a lot of like backend tweaks to cortex

**01:18:53** Anyone on youtube will notice like i've been going through that back catalog and trying to pick out episodes

**01:18:58** Where the analytics are really positive for new viewers and giving those custom thumbnails and tweaking a lot of little things to try to make it better

**01:19:06** And it's the same thing there of this year by actively messing around with it

**01:19:11** And really trying to again take it seriously

**01:19:15** Like this is a serious part of cortex

**01:19:18** All of the numbers for cortex youtube channel are like comically up year over year. It's great. It's really it's totally absurd

**01:19:26** And that's also a thing like I kind of discounted

**01:19:30** Oh, you've spent a huge amount of time working to make the cortex channel actually useful this year

**01:19:36** By applying what you know from the main channel to this

**01:19:40** And it's been stupidly successful. It's like there's a whole other audience

**01:19:45** For the cortex podcast that exists on youtube that just wouldn't be there without this work and

**01:19:52** Just making it easy for people to get onboarded with like hey instead of having the exact same thumbnail

**01:20:00** For a hundred episodes maybe make some custom thumbnails for the episodes

**01:20:05** That are more intriguing for a new viewer and it's like just that alone has made a big deal and I can see like oh

**01:20:13** With the channel just being more alive

**01:20:15** It also seems like youtube is slowly recommending those cortex animated to more viewers who just don't know anything at all about the channel

**01:20:23** It's like here's just a funny video to watch and then you can start getting brought into the fold of like

**01:20:28** Oh, if you like these videos, what do they come from? They come from the full episodes of cortex

**01:20:34** So that's kind of my summary of how this year has been and how it's gone. It's been kind of miserable

**01:20:40** I haven't wanted to talk about that

**01:20:42** And i've been real bummed out about it

**01:20:46** but i'm also just so

**01:20:48** happy to have done this review and to

**01:20:52** Be able to objectively look at what happened what has actually occurred

**01:20:57** and feel like

**01:20:59** This year could have been so much worse if I didn't have this idea in the back of my mind

**01:21:07** But I also did spend a lot of time kind of thinking about

**01:21:12** What does my work mean on this channel? How do I want things to change?

**01:21:17** And i'll talk about that in the theme section

**01:21:19** But the year went better than I thought it had and I accomplished

**01:21:24** More than I thought I had even if it was not my sort of

**01:21:29** dreams at the beginning of the year of everything that could happen that were just

**01:21:34** cut short by

**01:21:36** Covid

**01:21:37** I think that

**01:21:39** Your theme was a huge success. That's very kind of you to say mike. No, I mean it because

**01:21:46** If you would not have approached

**01:21:49** 2022

**01:21:51** With the idea of committing to youtube

**01:21:54** As you said you would be in a really bad situation right now. Yeah, financially

**01:22:00** Mentally like you would be in a much worse position

**01:22:03** And what you have achieved

**01:22:06** Because you approached the year with this mindset

**01:22:10** Is truly astounding?

**01:22:13** 160 million views this year

**01:22:15** Because you decided that you were committing to youtube and you were going to change thumbnails and titles is

**01:22:22** an astronomical achievement

**01:22:25** That you would not have done

**01:22:27** If you did not commit to that idea because as you said, right like

**01:22:32** It took you having reviewed the last decade to be like, all right

**01:22:37** I shouldn't take this for granted. I'm a youtuber and being a youtuber means this this and this

**01:22:42** That's the important part because to you being a youtuber before 2022 was just like I make videos

**01:22:48** Mm-hmm. You didn't make any yeah, so if you wouldn't have committed to some of the other things

**01:22:57** That it takes to being a youtuber to running a youtube business

**01:23:02** Your year would have been an absolute disaster where

**01:23:07** I think you can look at it to be like professionally a great success

**01:23:11** even though

**01:23:12** the core part

**01:23:14** Not really much seemed to have changed

**01:23:17** Okay, I'm happy to take that

**01:23:19** You can't 160 million views can be nothing but a success. It doesn't matter how you got. Yeah. Yeah. No, you're right. You're right

**01:23:27** It's not like you went and bought them you did a thing that you are supposed to be doing

**01:23:32** Yeah, that is what I mean by the year could have gone so much worse. And if I didn't have a theme that was

**01:23:39** Related to thinking about this we'd be having to like I'm just packing it in it's all over folks

**01:23:48** Every video is half off. Yeah

**01:23:52** But yeah, so no it did work out and I'm also very happy about the success for cortex as well. Yeah, me too

**01:23:59** Yeah, I would say like it's been a for cortex the podcast cortex brand the business

**01:24:05** 2022 has been excellent. Mm-hmm

**01:24:07** We have focused the show in a bunch of different ways and I'm very happy with the output of the show

**01:24:12** the YouTube channel is going from strength to strength like

**01:24:16** We have videos on the YouTube channel that are like approaching half a million views

**01:24:21** Which is like a thing that I never could have imagined in my life

**01:24:24** Yeah, it is crazy that like something with my voice in it has been heard

**01:24:30** Half a million times is astounding to me like it said it is a goal

**01:24:35** I never had because I just never thought it would be possible

**01:24:39** Right

**01:24:39** And so like that's such a cool thing and you know sales on the journals as like our core business

**01:24:45** Have continued to increase our like daily sales rate is continuing to like it's been great

**01:24:50** So like all of that part of our business has been going really good and I'm very very happy with it and it's because we're both

**01:24:58** Focusing on the business in new and different ways and so I think that that's great

**01:25:03** And it's like I'm happy that that you know, this YouTube stuff is trickling down to the channel

**01:25:07** I think it's it's improving everything like the audio listenership is up this year, which hasn't happened in a long time

**01:25:13** Yeah, it's totally a thing where improving the cortex YouTube channel is one of the ways that I recognized

**01:25:20** Oh, I can help cortex brands in this very direct way that I just kind of

**01:25:27** Hadn't internalized before and that's also been part of the motivation for like, oh, hey

**01:25:32** I'm just gonna take charge of everything behind the scenes on the cortex channel and like fiddling around with it and

**01:25:39** trying to make it as good as possible because that directly translates into

**01:25:44** sales for cortex brand and people getting journals and hopefully our future products as well and

**01:25:52** That's also an important thing to do in a year where maybe you didn't upload and I also think is an important thing to do

**01:25:59** Going forward into the future, but we can talk about that in a bit. So I

**01:26:04** Would like to hear what your theme is gonna be for 2023

**01:28:11** The year of the weekend. Oh

**01:28:14** Interesting. Okay. Here's my description. All right in a continued attempt to bring more structure to my life

**01:28:21** I'm going to address my ever creeping work-life balance issues by intentionally observing the most simple of work structures

**01:28:30** The weekend. I like it. It's very straightforward very straightforward

**01:28:35** And in a way that makes it difficult, okay, what do you mean by that? So this is one of the things that I've been toying with because

**01:28:44** Essentially as I was going through a lot of stuff. I was realizing that what I needed was more

**01:28:51** intentional time not working and

**01:28:55** the thing that I kept bumping up against is like

**01:28:58** Typically you have two days off a week

**01:29:01** Like that is a thing that tends to happen in most typical employment

**01:29:05** But it's not a thing that I have done in

**01:29:08** I do not know how many years because like when I was actually full-time employed

**01:29:13** I would use weekends to work on the podcasting stuff, right?

**01:29:16** Of course

**01:29:17** But when I was thinking about this idea of more intentional time off weekend weekend weekend was the word that kept popping up in

**01:29:25** my head, right

**01:29:27** But the concern that I had with the framing of this theme came back to the well a weekend is two days

**01:29:34** Right and if I'm thinking like I need to have a weekend every week

**01:29:39** That is a more resolution eat and theme II

**01:29:43** Because I don't and when I'm not saying I'm gonna take two days off every seven days

**01:29:48** because if I do that then

**01:29:51** I'm setting myself up to fail. Of course by saying that's going to happen

**01:29:56** So it is more of an attitude

**01:29:59** Than a fixed amount of time off

**01:30:02** So for me what it is about more than two days off

**01:30:08** every Saturday and Sunday

**01:30:10** It's about going back to the basics of a typical work structure for me. I

**01:30:15** Think the easiest way that I can address my work-life balance is to adopt more of a fundamental balance of like there are

**01:30:22** Days where I'm not working

**01:30:25** Mmm, and like that that is the typical idea

**01:30:28** My ideal plan of course is that every seven day period there's five working days and two rest days

**01:30:35** It would be incredible if I could do that

**01:30:37** But I am fully expecting that this will not be a thing I can achieve 52 times a year

**01:30:43** Mmm, it is more about for me if I can take more days

**01:30:49** When there is this mindset that I am

**01:30:53** Not working that is the real goal

**01:30:58** Because that is not a thing that I do

**01:31:00** Yeah, and it is not a thing that I have done for a really long time that like hey

**01:31:06** I'm just not gonna work today and I'm gonna be okay with that like that's something that I struggle with I treat

**01:31:13** Basically every single day with the same attitude

**01:31:16** There's always work to be done

**01:31:18** I'm willing to do work and I'm willing to take on anything that might appear that is my general

**01:31:25** attitude to every single day and

**01:31:28** I don't want that to be my

**01:31:31** 365 day a year attitude anymore

**01:31:34** Hmm now because really for me no matter how much structure I put in place in my life

**01:31:40** I have the tendency to allow new things to creep into it. Mm-hmm

**01:31:45** So if I

**01:31:47** Reframe what a typical week looks like for me and that part of that is rest

**01:31:51** I feel like this will help keep more of a consistency for me if I have decided that

**01:31:59** This coming Tuesday is gonna be a rest day. I can't book things in on that Tuesday

**01:32:06** So I have to find somewhere else in the week if they don't fit I can't do them

**01:32:09** do you have an idea for how you're going to

**01:32:13** Make that decision about this coming Tuesday is going to be a day off the way that I'm starting this is

**01:32:20** I will have my weekends on the weekend

**01:32:23** Okay

**01:32:23** It's the easiest way for me to do this and then when there is work that happens on the weekend

**01:32:29** Which is typically us it's cortex stuff

**01:32:32** We tend to record not on the weekend, but then I add it over the weekend

**01:32:37** Yeah, and so in those situations I will then look at my calendar and be like great

**01:32:41** I'm now gonna take Tuesday as a day off. Mm-hmm. Typically it's going to be Saturdays and Sundays

**01:32:48** But when Saturdays and Sundays need to be used for work

**01:32:51** I would then take a following day off and this comes from when I used to work in the bank if you worked on

**01:32:57** Saturday you would take a day in lieu

**01:33:00** It was called in either the following week or the week coming up

**01:33:04** And so I will make my decision that way, you know, like am I gonna take a day off this week?

**01:33:09** Or am I gonna take a day off next week?

**01:33:10** I'm gonna be a bit more flexible like that because that is a way I know how to

**01:33:15** Work because it's how I used to work. Yeah, that's like an approach that I'm used to

**01:33:19** Yeah, I was kind of wondering if some kind of debit system is a way to think about tracking it of like, ooh

**01:33:26** I'm way overdue because I've missed these days

**01:33:28** But that's like a much simpler start of like the concept of a day in lieu if you miss one with the easiest thing for me

**01:33:34** I've just like trying to just keep sides and Sundays, right?

**01:33:37** Like because that is the easiest way to do this because typically people are not working Saturdays and Sundays in

**01:33:43** General and so like that's how I'm gonna start

**01:33:46** I like your idea of like the weekend Wednesday idea that we spoke about before and that might be something I move more towards

**01:33:54** Once I understand a little bit more about how this is gonna go for me

**01:33:57** Like that's something because I think for me personally it would be better to not have those two days back to back

**01:34:03** Yeah, but I want to settle into this a little more before I move into that

**01:34:09** Yeah, I think that makes sense

**01:34:11** I like the weekend Wednesday thing because I do think the two days back to back

**01:34:15** Especially if you're self-employed is just very weirdly not optimal if you're in the situation that you're in which is basically you never take weekends

**01:34:24** anything is

**01:34:25** Significantly more optimal than that and yeah, just going with a regular schedule is not a bad place to start

**01:34:31** And it's not that like on Saturdays and Sundays. I'm recording for podcasts each. That's not how I am now

**01:34:37** It's not how I've been but it's my mindset

**01:34:40** Mm-hmm that needs to change if like I might not work on a Saturday, but that's not how I approach that day

**01:34:47** Yes, yeah, like I wasn't thinking I'm not gonna work today and then I also have a guilt

**01:34:54** I want to get rid of the guilt as part of this right like

**01:34:58** Allowing myself to do this is removing the guilt and like the year of structure helped me remove some of that guilt

**01:35:04** Where I would just sit and play a video game for an hour or two hours in the middle of my day

**01:35:09** I allowed myself to not feel guilty about that because there was a reason I was doing it

**01:35:13** Mm-hmm that for me taking that time in the middle of the day would help me be more effective because I was taking proper breaks

**01:35:20** but also like

**01:35:22** Understanding that my work time is weird where you know, you may do a nine to five, right? Well, I may do a ten to eight

**01:35:30** Mm-hmm, which is weird and longer, right? So I'll take two hours off in the middle

**01:35:36** Be a bit more normal about what a work amount of working hours would be like

**01:35:40** But they would be split in the middle by a nice break of my arm

**01:35:44** I'm being realistic that even on my weekend days like I know me like I'm gonna check my phone

**01:35:50** I'll respond to some messages here and there

**01:35:52** But like because at its core for me, this is no fixed appointments on my calendar. No

**01:35:59** Regular project work. So like, you know a weekend day. I'm not gonna be having a call with someone about something

**01:36:06** I'm not gonna be editing. I'm not gonna be preparing for a show like my typical work stuff

**01:36:12** But I'm not always gonna be like, all right, it's Thursday. It's a weekend day for me today. I

**01:36:17** Am putting my phone in a drawer

**01:36:19** Hmm because I know myself and I know that like when I'm on vacation

**01:36:24** I'll answer the occasional message but I can relax

**01:36:27** I can be completely relaxed and see a message in slack and just like respond to it and just like let it go

**01:36:33** I can do that. That is the skill that I have. I'm able to do it

**01:36:37** It's more that like I need that mindset more when I'm at home

**01:36:42** Like when I'm on vacation that mindset is easy for me of like I've chosen to relax here

**01:36:48** Oh someone needs something. Here's that thing you just carry on with your day, right?

**01:36:52** so I'm just about bringing some of that more into

**01:36:57** Every week of being able to be like, alright, I'm choosing to be off today

**01:37:01** If you need me, you can get me but like I'm not gonna

**01:37:04** Be guilty that I'm not doing prep for upgrade today or whatever it is, right?

**01:37:09** That's kind of like the biggest part of it. I think that's a good case of knowing yourself

**01:37:14** Like it's been interesting

**01:37:16** knowing you over the years because I was originally quite doubtful of your ability to like get messages and

**01:37:23** You know just respond to them and not have it impact you but I think this was totally a case of me

**01:37:29** overestimating how much like me you are in this regard where it's like for me

**01:37:34** That's just terrible like ruins a day off and like really derails me

**01:37:38** But I've observed you long enough to see that like no you totally can do that

**01:37:41** Like you can flip a message and it just doesn't affect your day in the slightest and I think that's great to

**01:37:47** not go super hard on the weekend in terms of like a

**01:37:53** Fantasy pure version of no work is gonna happen. It's like no, no, you know you this is fine

**01:37:58** You can answer messages. It's no big deal. And if you're just not doing

**01:38:02** Major project work that's already a huge step in the right direction

**01:38:06** It doesn't need to be like a pure day to be a success because there are messages that I can get that can derail my day

**01:38:13** But they tend to be big enough that I should know about them

**01:38:17** Yes, I think can happen and it can ruin what would otherwise be a day off

**01:38:20** But that's typically something that I should know about if that's the case

**01:38:24** Yeah, you're in the position where you can have like emergencies in a way that my work just doesn't have and so yes

**01:38:32** You can be derailed but there's almost no scenario in which you wouldn't want to be derailed by whatever something

**01:38:40** Because maybe I can help yeah, but like with this of like no fixed appointments

**01:38:46** No large projects there might be choices that I make to work on something

**01:38:52** But there are a couple of criteria for this. Okay, it should not be at the expense of doing something else and it should be novel

**01:38:59** Hmm. So for me, there is something that fits perfectly in this category, which is product design for Cortex brand

**01:39:08** Mmm. Okay, which is a thing that I always want to spend more time on and this is like if I have like an idea

**01:39:15** That's bubbling away and I've got a day off if I'm like

**01:39:19** It's nothing I want to play this my watch it in as busy with something

**01:39:23** That is the kind of work that I'm gonna do if I'm gonna do anything

**01:39:26** which is like

**01:39:28** I'm gonna get out my iPad and I'm gonna draw out the layout for a new notebook design or whatever, you know

**01:39:35** I'm gonna do some research into a thing because at the moment that kind of work still feels like novel

**01:39:41** exciting fun work for me because it's new work and it's a skill that I'm trying to build and I enjoy that so

**01:39:48** Like that's the kind of stuff if I'm gonna do anything would be my ideal kind of stuff to do

**01:39:53** But that's not what the main

**01:39:55** Outcome of these days are that's still for me to talk about in a minute

**01:39:58** It's like the likelihood of me getting to that is slim based on all the other stuff

**01:40:02** I want to do but like that's the idea that like if work is ever gonna be done on these days

**01:40:06** That's the ideal kind of work that's done

**01:40:09** But I don't know how realistic it's gonna be for me to get to that work with all the other things

**01:40:14** I want to do. Okay, so you have a bunch of plans that

**01:40:17** Okay, I was like, yeah, I had a couple of questions, but no so tell me what your plans are first

**01:40:21** All right. So this is handyman Mike. Oh

**01:40:25** Is a handyman Mike comes in right with a hammer in his jeans exactly the jean hammer guy. I

**01:40:32** Want to be able to commit more time to my family life to my home life and to my social life

**01:40:39** That's what all of this is for. I've been in a new home for like three weeks and

**01:40:44** There's a lot to do and I'm enjoying it. I'm enjoying turning my attention to home projects

**01:40:51** I've been replacing some door handles. Ooh, you know, like these are things I didn't know how to replace a door handle

**01:40:58** I've never tried. Why would I you know what? I never tried to do that before

**01:41:01** It's a very simple thing and I did it and I'm like great

**01:41:04** I know how to do that now and like there are little things like that that I'm turning my hand to that

**01:41:09** I'm finding enjoyment in

**01:41:11** Obviously setting up smart home devices is a thing that I'm enjoying and doing but I knew that I was gonna enjoy and do that

**01:41:16** Mm-hmm, but I'm also enjoying to do other things building furniture

**01:41:20** I knew how to do that and I enjoy it as much as the next guy like it's a fun thing to do

**01:41:24** It has a value but there are little

**01:41:27** Projects in the home right now that I'm doing that are completely new to me things

**01:41:31** I'd never tried to do before and I'm enjoying

**01:41:36** learning how to maintain a home we have a garden Oh and

**01:41:42** Dealing with everything that it comes I had to buy a broom

**01:41:46** I

**01:41:48** Cuz I just leaves is like how do I get rid of the leaves?

**01:41:51** I guess I get a broom. Do you mean a rake Mike? Is that what you mean? Nope a broom like an outdoors broom

**01:41:58** You mean a rake? That's what that's what a rake is

**01:42:02** This is wood and it has like very coarse wire brush

**01:42:08** Okay, right and look look I'm not as hand I'm not as handy as you so I don't know what these tools are

**01:42:13** Right, but the front garden is concrete. I can't use a rake on that. Hmm

**01:42:18** Okay, if I rake the concrete I ruined the concrete and everyone's enjoyment in the neighborhood, right?

**01:42:24** Okay, right. So it's like sweeping ain't too sweet rake for the back garden because there's grass there

**01:42:29** Okay, but the front is paved. It's like concrete. So you can't use a break on that

**01:42:34** I'm using a broom and it's like this is the thing that like I guess this is what you do and I did it and

**01:42:39** Like great. That's how you do that. So lots of little things as I

**01:42:43** Lived in an apartment, you know for years and before that it was in a family home

**01:42:48** And I wasn't responsible for these things and I'm now responsible for these things and owning a home is very different to owning an apartment

**01:42:56** I'm realizing

**01:42:56** Yeah

**01:42:57** And there's a lot more stuff that you need to do or stuff that you don't need to do but you want to do

**01:43:02** You're king of your castle now. I sure am and you have a whole domain under your responsibility

**01:43:07** and I am enjoying it greatly and I want to

**01:43:11** Be proud of my home because this is what I wanted and this have gotten what I wanted

**01:43:16** And now I want to take care of it and treat it well and then it will treat us well

**01:43:20** And so that's a big thing that I want to turn my attention to

**01:43:25** this is one of the very key parts, but the other things that I want is I

**01:43:31** have done a very bad job in

**01:43:34** my life of

**01:43:37** Spending time with my friends

**01:43:40** This has been a thing that I've been very bad at over the last 10 years. I

**01:43:45** Do not make enough effort and I want to make more effort

**01:43:50** One of the excuses that I give is that I am so busy. Mm-hmm. Well, I'm making more time

**01:43:59** So in that time, I should be able to go

**01:44:03** See friends have lunches have dinners

**01:44:06** Whatever it is. I should be able to make that time more easily

**01:44:11** Don't have a lot of friends in London

**01:44:13** But some of the people I hold dearest to me live in London you being one of them

**01:44:19** We see each other so infrequently. Yeah, we're both awful at this. We're both terrible at it

**01:44:24** But if one of us is going to try harder, then maybe it will be easier

**01:44:29** Right because we so frequently say we should get lunch and then we don't do it. Yeah until we're out of the country

**01:44:36** Each other in California somewhere. There's always a terrible sign. Yeah

**01:44:40** If I am going to make more time it's more likely I'm gonna find a time

**01:44:46** When you're also available, right? Yeah, if that's a change that I'm making in my life

**01:44:51** We can both do weekends on weird days because I already do weekends on Wednesday

**01:44:55** Yeah, and again, it's like if that's the case I can plan around that more effectively, right?

**01:45:00** Like if you tell me I'm gonna be available on this Thursday in three weeks from now great

**01:45:06** I can now structure my week to make sure that's one of my weekend days or whatever

**01:45:10** Mmm

**01:45:10** And also like I'm in a part of London that I wanted to be in for a while and it's more what I wanted and

**01:45:18** I want to experience that area more and put more roots in there

**01:45:22** Similarly like you said a phrase on our last episode which I haven't been able to get out of my head

**01:45:28** Mm-hmm outside with wife time. Oh, right. You like that? I'm like I want to do that

**01:45:34** Now I'm not gonna time track it. Yeah, but I want to do it and it's like it was such a simple phrase of like

**01:45:41** Yes, me and Idina spend time at home, but we can also spend time outside of home

**01:45:46** Yes, and it's fundamentally different. Yes, and it's great

**01:45:49** Look, I'm sure all couples will understand this the types of conversations that you will have at a restaurant dinner table

**01:45:56** I was very different to what you will have at home. Mm-hmm because when you're at home, you can watch TV

**01:46:01** Yep, I want to do more of that as well in my life and I think that

**01:46:07** That will be a great thing that I can do if my weekends are free the number of pivotal relationship

**01:46:14** conversations that have happened

**01:46:16** Inside the house versus outside the house. That's a shocking ratio

**01:46:21** I think it's just you have a different kind of conversation when you're on a long car drive together

**01:46:27** Or you're out in a park together or something it is. It's totally just different and yeah, it's it's good for a relationship

**01:46:34** so obviously part of this is I need to be smarter about my scheduling and so one of the things that I've been thinking about is

**01:46:42** there's some stuff that I

**01:46:44** Can probably do while I'm at home

**01:46:46** Like if I have like one thing to do in a day

**01:46:49** Maybe I can just take care of it at home and then get on with the rest of the things I might want to do

**01:46:53** At home. So like some stuff might be like half days which are kind of weekend days

**01:46:59** But the bigger part of that is

**01:47:03** Not coming to the studio for a whole day for one thing

**01:47:07** Mmm, which I've been doing for a while like I have a once a I've got a podcast recording in the evening

**01:47:13** Well, then coming to the studio at 9 or 10 and being here all the way into 8 when like I don't need to do that

**01:47:21** Yeah, right. So what I'm now gonna try and do is

**01:47:26** Combine some of that stuff more

**01:47:27** So I'm more likely to be if I'm here like working on stuff for the whole time and then the next day be at home

**01:47:33** All day because I've combined these days together a little more

**01:47:37** So that's like a thing about being smart

**01:47:40** I like if someone wants to have a call with me

**01:47:42** Well, I'm only gonna allow that call to occur on a day where I already have something else

**01:47:48** So I'm not breaking up the week in weird ways. Mmm

**01:47:52** So I'm gonna see how that goes

**01:47:53** That was something that I was trying more in the air structure in 2022

**01:47:58** And that's definitely as something that's helped and I've been getting better at that

**01:48:02** But now there is more of a result of it where like previously it was just like oh, this will make my schedule be more sensible

**01:48:09** But now it's like so I can spend more time at home more easily

**01:48:14** Because I'm

**01:48:16** Compacting my days a little bit better

**01:48:18** But you know talking about structure there are obvious continued elements of my year of structure here, right?

**01:48:23** So yeah, yeah time for myself reducing commitments reducing mental load and booked an intentional vacation time that the vacation time is gonna stay

**01:48:31** obviously as I mentioned so like they're coming through and

**01:48:36** The other thing that's coming along with this is like over time

**01:48:40** That I'm hoping that the year of the weekend will help to change my feeling of needing to be constantly

**01:48:48** connected to my work

**01:48:50** Hmm that like if I try to take more time away

**01:48:53** I can also more quickly identify the things that people need most urgently and most frequently from me

**01:49:01** It's like if I'm trying to be away, but people need me for things

**01:49:04** I can try and realize what they are and or realize that people don't need me as much as I think they do

**01:49:11** Mmm, if I'm not here as much and people are good with it, then great for everyone, right?

**01:49:17** Oh, like if I'm trying to take a day off and someone needs something from me

**01:49:21** Like what is that thing does that thing come up frequently?

**01:49:24** Is there something that can be done about that or is someone else better placed for that so that these are the things I'm trying to

**01:49:31** realize and

**01:49:33** Part this is I need to learn to be able to let things go more let things wait more

**01:49:39** I have do have a habit of trying to quickly jump to fix things at the expense of my own time

**01:49:45** That could probably wait a day. Hmm. I feel like I respond to emails way faster than I get responses

**01:49:52** They did not put this at the same level of priority that I did right

**01:49:56** I think I need to find a medium there of like this could probably wait till tomorrow

**01:50:01** That I need to try and get into that a little bit more

**01:50:04** I think so

**01:50:04** That's kind of what I'm hoping to see from this to be a lasting effect as well of trying to work out the things that maybe

**01:50:11** Can be shifted around then that goes into what I was talking about earlier

**01:50:15** Like if there's things that I realize that I need to be able to provide people more frequently

**01:50:20** Maybe is there somebody else that could do that for me?

**01:50:23** Mm-hmm. I'm gonna say so that's the year of the weekend. I like it. I like it a lot now

**01:50:28** I have my daily questions too, right?

**01:50:30** So in in the back of the theme system journal

**01:50:32** There's a section where you can write a bunch of prompts down a mark off each day if you've succeeded in them

**01:50:38** I'm adding home to these what do you mean by adding home to these like just a home section?

**01:50:43** But I've added a new daily question, which is just the word home

**01:50:46** Oh, okay is like I will interpret in a bunch of ways the daily questions

**01:50:51** I asked myself they're all singular words then I like to interpret it

**01:50:54** However, I like and decide if I made effort in that so now they are create advance

**01:51:01** Advances means did you push something forward today?

**01:51:04** revenue teamwork marriage friends health free time

**01:51:09** Structure and now home is added

**01:51:12** So I look at each of these every day and think did I make some movement in each of these categories?

**01:51:18** if it tends to be if I have a ten out of ten day, I feel like I have

**01:51:23** succeeded in a day which will undoubtedly help me push my theme forward to

**01:51:29** Mm-hmm. Cuz also I feel like even if I've had a bad day and this is like a very typical thing for me out of day

**01:51:34** I'm not feeling good

**01:51:35** But if I can score over six or seven out of ten that day, I'm like

**01:51:40** Well, I didn't enjoy today, but at least it was a day where I was productive in areas that matter to me

**01:51:46** Mm-hmm, you know so that that helps me as like a secondary thing in my journal every day

**01:51:50** Yeah, I find this one just charmingly straightforward. Mm-hmm. I really like it. I also do think that it is

**01:51:58** especially for someone

**01:52:00** self-employed

**01:52:01** not easy

**01:52:02** straightforward doesn't mean easy and I think everyone who self-employed really feels that pressure to just kind of dissolve away your weekends and

**01:52:12** it's

**01:52:13** really bad to do long term and

**01:52:16** I think this is a really nice follow-on for you from the year of structure

**01:52:20** It seems like a really specific and actionable way to progress that one forward and also

**01:52:27** Having just bought a new home. I think this is perfect. Yeah, I really need

**01:52:33** To do things and so like this is 100% what's pushed this for it

**01:52:39** but there are these other things that I do really care about like

**01:52:42** Having more social time spending more time with my family like these are really important to me and my current

**01:52:49** Working life is not allowing that so I'm making some changes

**01:52:54** I'm gonna continue to make changes to make sure that I can give people around me what they need

**01:52:58** I can give myself what I need and I can also produce the work that I want to make

**01:53:02** So what does 2023 look like for you? I'm excited man, you know, I never know what I'm gonna get with you wordwise

**01:53:08** Like there were brackets in last years

**01:53:11** What could we have this time year of work?

**01:53:14** Huh, that's it. I

**01:53:16** Mean there are some brackets. I can't resist a couple of brackets

**01:53:19** Wait, let me let this sink I want to let it sink in a second before you give me the brackets

**01:53:24** Hey brackets will come up later. It's year of work. I can't believe how

**01:53:29** Close we are but in the opposite I could almost call it year of work days

**01:53:34** Because to get it up front like obviously I'm gonna be focused on work

**01:53:37** But it's also part of that is really important to respect the weekends

**01:53:41** And so we literally have inverse ones this year that are basically the same thing Wow

**01:53:48** That's fascinating

**01:53:49** originally my idea was that new decades dawn was going to be a two-year project and

**01:53:53** I was just kind of going through the year just like oh man like I've done my homework in advance

**01:53:58** I already know that it's gonna be a two-year project. But yeah

**01:54:02** Since September since thinking about things

**01:54:05** there's another way in which I actually feel like I accomplished a bunch of the things that I

**01:54:12** thought were going to take two years in the one year of

**01:54:16** New decades dawn in terms of thinking about how do I work coming up with some changes for the

**01:54:23** schedule the way I

**01:54:26** select and

**01:54:27** prioritize and publish videos that I kind of feel like oh new decades dawn

**01:54:33** Lives on in year of work, but it didn't make sense to actually just keep that as oh, I'm running with this for two years

**01:54:41** There's like a different focus here, but the obvious part of this is

**01:54:46** Just after a year where I didn't get much work done. It's a real clear target of okay next year

**01:54:53** Just has to be a year where I prioritize

**01:54:57** Having my head down and getting a bunch of work done on actual videos

**01:55:02** Towards that end. I've already

**01:55:05** Said no to and canceled a bunch of travel plans that were originally gonna be next year

**01:55:11** I have two unmovable things that I'm still keeping but I've really been having this filter of

**01:55:17** Opportunities that have come up of just being like no no no that's not going to happen

**01:55:22** I think that's a really good simple one for you because you are

**01:55:27** Incredibly impacted by like when you travel like it impacts you greatly right and I think that that makes a lot of sense

**01:55:34** For you to reduce your travel as a way to increase your work output for sure

**01:55:38** It's like one of the biggest min max decisions. I can make every canceled

**01:55:43** Conference is like inversely related to additional videos for sure

**01:55:48** So like there are still a couple of things that I've said yes to but it has been a much stronger

**01:55:52** filtering focus of I need an incredibly good reason to say yes as

**01:55:57** Opposed to a default stance of like this could be interesting

**01:56:01** So let me go but no no it's year of work kind of just a head-down year focus on making the videos

**01:56:07** It's a way to sort of I don't want to say make up for last year

**01:56:11** But this runs in with the thumbnails of like okay the work that was done on the channel last year

**01:56:16** That was great, but it's also time limited it can't continue on with this year

**01:56:21** So there just have to be more videos. It would be almost impossible not to have more videos

**01:56:26** so I'm just gonna kind of focus on that and

**01:56:30** Frame a lot of decisions in terms of this for listeners

**01:56:35** it's really important for me to be clear here though that

**01:56:39** having had all of the experience of

**01:56:42** Being self-employed over these large number of years. This doesn't mean that this is like a crunch year

**01:56:50** I feel like I've

**01:56:53** Developed enough as a person that I can understand the importance of weekends and that's the

**01:57:01** Dedicated not working time is just as important as the working time like they they both help each other

**01:57:07** So the idea is not like oh, man

**01:57:09** I'm gonna be putting in like 16 hour days every day and just like working myself

**01:57:14** Ragged it's like that's not the idea. It's frame everything in terms of useful work, which includes things like

**01:57:21** Respecting the weekend. So that's that's an intrinsic part of this. So

**01:57:26** one of the big things

**01:57:28** That I kind of was thinking about all last year in terms of new decades dawn

**01:57:34** is what I mentioned to you at the beginning of kind of taking a page from your book and

**01:57:39** noticing how you feel at different times and

**01:57:43** Taking stock of what makes me feel

**01:57:47** The worst about work and how can I change that?

**01:57:50** And so one of the things in past years that was related to a theme that has been a huge improvement in my life

**01:57:56** Is I stopped publishing videos on days where I was also

**01:58:03** Exporting them from Final Cut. This was just one of these little decisions where I realized like

**01:58:07** Oh, this is causing a huge amount of stress where it's like

**01:58:10** Oh, I'm trying to finish a video on the same day that I want to publish it and I realized hey

**01:58:16** You know how you can get rid of a huge amount of stress in your life

**01:58:19** Just have a rule that the day that you export the video is not the same day that it publishes

**01:58:25** if each of those just can't be the same day and

**01:58:28** With extremely rare exception I've stuck to that and it's been a huge quality of life improvement

**01:58:34** and

**01:58:35** so I had that in the back of my mind particularly as the year has gone on and I've been

**01:58:43** Increasingly stressed that I don't have something for December to publish. So for the listeners

**01:58:50** The background here is that in terms of the ad rates. I

**01:58:55** Can just say it's roughly true that

**01:58:59** publishing a video in December is

**01:59:02** Worth about twice as much as January if you just think about that for a second

**01:59:07** It's like okay

**01:59:07** Hey, if you don't upload tons of videos if you only upload a small number of videos

**01:59:13** It's crazy not to have one of the videos be in December if you're not uploading all the time

**01:59:18** I've always known that and it's always been a real stress point just like with this year

**01:59:23** It's been also a stress point because this is the big time of the year for Cortex and as Cortex brand has become more important

**01:59:30** This has also put more pressure on the end of the year and so it's like oh god

**01:59:34** I've got this mounting pressure and so I've made a decision

**01:59:37** That's one of the things that I want to do for work next year is what I am calling a

**01:59:44** Christmas present to myself

**01:59:47** The Christmas present is

**01:59:50** The first video that I finished next year. I am going to save for Christmas

**01:59:55** Wow

**01:59:56** I am going to have for the first time in my whole life a

**02:00:01** video that's done and I'm going to sit on it and I'm going to have that for Christmas and that will remove

**02:00:09** What has been one of the most big and miserable stress points in my life for years is

**02:00:16** Trying to have something for the end of the year. There's a bunch of reasons why I kind of

**02:00:21** Couldn't do this in the past

**02:00:22** I think that's partly to do with a bunch of changes in the way that YouTube used to work versus now

**02:00:28** Which is again kind of thinking seriously about how things actually are

**02:00:32** I also think it's different in the way that I now do a lot of my videos and select topics

**02:00:38** I feel like this wasn't possible in the past, but I think I can actually do it now and

**02:00:45** This year I actually kind of did two

**02:00:49** Extremely small tests so with the channel much faster approaching 900 million views than I had anticipated

**02:00:58** Months ago now I actually made a quick little video

**02:01:02** Where it's just a minute long, but it's still like just prove to yourself a proof of concept that you can do something and build

**02:01:08** up from there I

**02:01:10** Wrote and recorded a little video where I'm just saying hey the channel past 900 million views

**02:01:16** I'm gonna take questions for a Q&A for a billion view. I recorded it. I got the final audio

**02:01:22** I sent it off for animation. We put the music in it's all set and it's sitting on my channel

**02:01:28** just waiting for the day that I actually crossed 900 million views and

**02:01:33** That's the first time I've ever had anything done in advance

**02:01:37** Just waiting for the time that a thing will happen

**02:01:41** This is where I talk about like the smallest possible thing is still a big deal

**02:01:45** This is literally the smallest

**02:01:48** Possible thing that could ever happen

**02:01:50** But like I cannot tell you the psychological feeling that has created me of like oh wow it's possible

**02:01:57** I can do this. I didn't know what to tell me about this

**02:02:01** Lattering on from that in the theme of Gray sometimes uploads weird stuff to his channel that doesn't fit in with anything else I

**02:02:11** last year kind of

**02:02:13** Filmed and a sort of I'll just call it unboxing video

**02:02:16** I think I'll make more sense when people see it

**02:02:19** But when I was at my parents as part of the like whole Tesla thing

**02:02:24** I happened to film like opening up this box full of mystery stuff that I had I

**02:02:29** filmed that and

**02:02:30** I'd been thinking for a long time about turning that into a little video and I always thought oh if that's gonna go up

**02:02:36** I think it makes sense for it to go up as like a little thing at Christmas time right before whatever the main video is

**02:02:41** gonna be and this is the same thing instead of

**02:02:45** Waiting until I was closer to the time after I made that little like ask gray a question thing. I thought okay cool

**02:02:53** Let me edit and finish and film and export and upload and have ready in advance this

**02:03:00** Extra video which is now like this little step up from the totally minor thing and it's like it's set

**02:03:06** It's ready to go and it feels fantastic

**02:03:10** Fantastic of like okay great

**02:03:11** I have a thing that will just go up the day before the main video goes up and it's all done

**02:03:16** So I kind of proven to myself this year in what I know as I described them sound like

**02:03:23** Comically small ways but like I proved to myself. Oh, this is possible

**02:03:28** you can make a video and have it ready and you can sit on it and

**02:03:33** You're not gonna be like weird and nervous about it

**02:03:36** Sure, these two are like funny exceptions, but I think I can do it for an actual main video

**02:03:41** I think that this is very valuable because when you initially said that you would hold the first video

**02:03:47** I was like, oh, I don't know about that. Like that seems like a big

**02:03:51** jump because

**02:03:53** It's a long time to just sit on something and I know that you don't typically do things that are like topical

**02:03:59** But still it's like who knows what might happen, right?

**02:04:02** Like exactly so you've got to be able to I think come to that realization first that it is possible for you to do it

**02:04:08** Even if this is something so small. Yeah, I know how stupid it sounds with these trivial examples

**02:04:13** But it is a big deal for me because I've just never worked this way before

**02:04:18** and these little projects were just

**02:04:21** intentional and

**02:04:23** so

**02:04:24** When I say like year of work, it also encompassed this concept of I think I know a way to

**02:04:31** Reduce a huge amount of stress in my work. That also always makes me just less effective

**02:04:38** I've always been a kind of person that as deadlines loom. They don't encourage me to get stuff done

**02:04:44** I always just feel worse and I become increasingly less effective as a deadline looms

**02:04:49** and so this is kind of a way to

**02:04:54** Sort of get around that problem a little bit of like what's the biggest deadline?

**02:04:59** Okay, great

**02:05:00** Whatever my first video is it's just gonna be for that and if I'm done with it in February

**02:05:06** That's the deal like it's gonna go up in December

**02:05:08** but the critical thing here is that so think about this as

**02:05:14** The work year goes on. I have a video it's ready for December and

**02:05:19** Then when I have the next video that's ready in this moment

**02:05:24** I will have an interesting choice because there will be two videos that are done and then in that moment

**02:05:31** I can decide if I'm going to say

**02:05:34** Swap them. Oh the video I just did maybe that one makes more sense for December

**02:05:38** So I will take the other completed one and publish it now and have the other one saved for December

**02:05:45** And this is like open my mind to thinking about of course my metaphor for everything in life

**02:05:53** Magic gathering

**02:05:57** Where in magic the gathering when it is your turn as you become a better player

**02:06:03** There's a thing that is really important which they call sequencing which is oh you're gonna play

**02:06:09** three cards on your turn and

**02:06:11** New players don't really think about the order that they're going to play those cards because it seems like it doesn't matter

**02:06:17** But as you become a more advanced player you understand Oh

**02:06:21** Sequencing doing this one before that one actually makes a huge difference in ways that are not immediately obvious

**02:06:28** And so it's kind of exciting to me like oh my god if I do this

**02:06:32** I'll be able to

**02:06:33** Sequence the videos to make a decision about would I rather have this one at Christmas or what?

**02:06:38** I rather have that one at Christmas. This is one of the big ideas of

**02:06:43** How am I gonna work next year? It's more than just this in ways that I don't

**02:06:49** Entirely want to talk about right now, but this is the beginning of the idea of

**02:06:55** what is going to happen in the year of work that is a direct result of

**02:07:00** thinking about a lot of the problems that I've had over the past many years and

**02:07:05** thinking about how do I want to

**02:07:07** Continue working forward in the future to make it easier and more effective for myself

**02:07:13** I think this is kind of a motivating goal

**02:07:16** Because it's about a really positive upside

**02:07:19** Have a thing ready for the most effective time of the year and also reduce the most miserable making stress that you have

**02:07:26** Yeah, having gone through the data

**02:07:28** Like I have actual trend lines to show that this time for reals ease the long covid seems to be drying up

**02:07:35** And so I can reasonably expect that I can have a 80% of normal working schedule starting next year

**02:07:41** the concrete focus is on just

**02:07:45** Having that normal working schedule again. There's clear work days. There's clear weekends

**02:07:52** it doesn't all meld into a giant mush of

**02:07:57** Being ineffective at all days like the last year has been

**02:08:01** re-crystallize those borders focus on the videos you have a system for

**02:08:07** sequencing and this also

**02:08:09** Connects to if listeners remember from last year I talked about like I have this idea of seasonality for a YouTube channel and

**02:08:17** as a general statement going along with like how ad rates work on YouTube it

**02:08:23** Should be that I upload more videos in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year

**02:08:28** Mm-hmm and any year where that's not true is just sort of a failure like that's not how it should work

**02:08:35** So that's kind of what I'm aiming for is

**02:08:40** Chill out about

**02:08:43** Panicking for putting up a video immediately

**02:08:45** I just think like building up a little bit of a buffer even if it's just like a one or two video buffer

**02:08:52** Makes a huge deal in the ability to not constantly panic and also for just like

**02:09:02** improving my own

**02:09:03** Personal life like I think like last year I took a trip with my family and we went to Norway

**02:09:08** But I didn't get the airlines video finished before this trip

**02:09:12** Which is what I was really trying to do and so then it kind of like

**02:09:15** Impacted a little bit in the back of my mind like how much I could actually relax and take that time off

**02:09:20** mm-hmm, and this is also like a thing to fix because

**02:09:25** That makes the vacation less effective, which means when I get back to work. It's less effective

**02:09:31** So having some buffer is the thing that I want to do as part of like the actionable

**02:09:38** What makes this year of work different from other years?

**02:09:41** And I think that it is a thing that is achievable

**02:09:44** But yeah

**02:09:44** It does mean that like the upload schedule might be a bit weird and it is going to be

**02:09:48** The strangest thing ever for me to have a video that will be done

**02:09:52** But like I'm gonna hold that one until December that's gonna be very strange

**02:09:56** But I'm kind of talking about it here as a way to commit myself to

**02:10:01** Actually doing that to not being able to back out of it to be like oh

**02:10:06** Have some excuse in the moment for why this time I really have to not do that

**02:10:11** It's like no no no you're actually going to do this

**02:10:13** There'll be a fun canary in the coal mine for cortex ins when they see you publish a video in 2023

**02:10:19** They know the Christmas one set

**02:10:22** Yeah, no, that's it's totally true when the video goes up

**02:10:25** It'll be like okay, there's actually two there's something just like sitting on the channel. That's waiting. They know a secret

**02:10:31** Yeah, they know a secret so just to quickly go over the two brackets that go along with this

**02:10:37** Yeah

**02:10:38** Look, there's got to be brackets right?

**02:10:40** There's year of work

**02:10:41** But also not to bring up the topic again, but part of this has been motivated by the AI art discussions

**02:10:49** So the first set of brackets is work while you still can

**02:10:58** So there's like a carrot and a stick here

**02:11:02** Which the carrot is I think I've figured out how to make this like way less stressful for myself

**02:11:07** And I'm like pre-committing to a strategy that will have that be true, but the stick is

**02:11:13** listening back to last year's episode where I was like

**02:11:17** Estimating timelines for careers and entertainment they seem like comically optimistic to me now. So

**02:11:24** this is one of these things where

**02:11:27** It's hard to know how to think about the future

**02:11:32** it's sometimes hard to know how to place bets on things that really matter and

**02:11:40** a question like how viable is a career in entertainment in the face of

**02:11:45** Increasing AI art systems is like a real high variance high uncertainty question and it's hard to know

**02:11:52** Where is that going to go? But in the face of that high uncertainty it?

**02:11:57** Extra makes sense that focusing on a year of work

**02:12:01** There's absolutely no downside to that right now and there's only upside

**02:12:08** So if my career is ultimately going to be cut much shorter much sooner than I expected by

**02:12:16** auto-generated videos on tik-tok

**02:12:18** Guess what like it's really time to get your butt in gear

**02:12:22** immediately if that's true and

**02:12:25** I

**02:12:26** Take that idea pretty seriously

**02:12:29** But I'm also open to the idea that I could be totally wrong about that that you know

**02:12:35** maybe as we discussed in previous episodes, there's an s-curve coming that we don't see and

**02:12:42** This year seems like it might be the critical year in which we see if that's true

**02:12:47** Like does that does this keep exponentially improving or does it peter out into an s-curve?

**02:12:52** Either way it feels like the optimal thing to do is really focus on a year of work

**02:12:58** Even if you don't know the outcome, this is a good decision either way

**02:13:03** That's why that is part of this bracket which is like work

**02:13:06** While you still can right before the robots come for your job. And then the other bracket for that is

**02:13:13** work on your health and so one thing I have definitely learned over the last year in particular, but

**02:13:20** really the last many years is that

**02:13:23** being physically fit is

**02:13:26** part of working in a way that I just never really thought about before and

**02:13:31** especially

**02:13:32** having in quite a depressing manner in the COVID years gone from my most physically fit to my least

**02:13:41** physically fit in the space of about a year is like that really

**02:13:46** highlights the distinction in how much this can affect you and

**02:13:50** so there is a kind of sub year of health that goes along with this I am kind of

**02:13:58** rolling that into work and the reason I roll that into work is because it also goes along with just

**02:14:05** figuring out how can I do this in a less stressful way when I am stressed about video productions

**02:14:11** That is the easiest time for me to blow off all kinds of health stuff because I kind of tell myself

**02:14:16** Oh, it matters way more to get this video finished than it does to exercise or eat properly today

**02:14:23** Because I just need to get this thing done

**02:14:25** But if I have a buffer video I kind of don't have that excuse of like oh the like the most critical thing is still

**02:14:32** Uncertain, so I just have to push through this time

**02:14:35** So work on your health is part of year of work because those two things are just

**02:14:41** Really connected to me decreasing the stress takes away a lot of excuses to be super bad about health

**02:14:47** I'm also just in a terrible health position now and I need to

**02:14:52** claw back a lot of what happened over the past year and

**02:14:56** Things like my RSI returning is one of those real indicators of like hey, buddy

**02:15:01** This is a bad situation

**02:15:03** You haven't been able to properly focus on that but this needs to take like top priority

**02:15:09** And so really I think a way to kind of summarize how I'm looking at next year is in that

**02:15:16** Four light bulbs area of how do you spend time and focus on things that it's a year of?

**02:15:23** burning the

**02:15:24** Work and health light bulbs quite brightly. That's what things are gonna be in summary

**02:15:29** It's like you're of work while you can end on your health

**02:15:36** That's that really takes a ride that theme name there

**02:15:41** If you've gotten this far in the episode it is

**02:15:44** Safe to say that you are interested in yearly themes and we really recommend that you think about a theme for yourself

**02:15:51** Mm-hmm take everything that we've suggested and try and come up with something that you want to achieve

**02:15:58** over the next year

**02:16:00** Somewhere that you want to see yourself in 365 days from now

**02:16:04** We believe that a perfect accompaniment to a yearly theme is the theme system journal

**02:16:10** It's why we created it to help us keep track of our themes

**02:16:13** And to help us keep track of our personal and professional lives while we're trying to keep on course for the year

**02:16:20** With the theme system journal you can spend time each day reflecting on your yearly theme

**02:16:25** The journaling pages are very flexible. They're very customizable

**02:16:29** We believe in a light structure for the journal

**02:16:32** So we don't give you daily prompts we want you to think about what you want to know from your day

**02:16:36** For example, there are four boxes on each journaling page. I write something good something bad. What am I thinking about?

**02:16:42** What am I looking forward to these help me kind of think about and talk about what's going on in my life

**02:16:48** You know when I was saying about when I come up with my theme when I'm thinking about my theme

**02:16:53** When I sit and write down in my journal every day what I'm thinking about

**02:16:56** They tend to be really good and also see what's in the bad section

**02:17:00** They tend to be really good reminders of the types of things I want to change going into my next theme time, right?

**02:17:06** So that's where a lot of that thinking starts before it makes it into my Apple note system

**02:17:10** But the great thing about the structure of the journal is you're able to change it up because it's up to you what you want

**02:17:15** To put on those pages every day

**02:17:17** But we give you just enough I think to help get you started and then for you to go and move forward

**02:17:22** And make it fit with your own ways of working

**02:17:25** We mentioned the daily themes

**02:17:27** You know these questions that we ask ourselves every day to make sure that we're kind of keeping on track of where we want to be

**02:17:32** There's a whole section at the back of the journal for that too years of work went into making the theme system journal a very high

**02:17:38** Quality product it's made of great materials. The construction is fantastic

**02:17:43** it has our well-loved perforated corners so you can mark off every day and easily find your place and

**02:18:41** But I don't journal every day a journal every working day

**02:18:44** And so it lasts me a little bit longer you could journal whenever you want and it would last you even longer or even less

**02:18:50** You know, maybe you journal four times a day and it's not gonna last you 90 days

**02:18:53** Yeah, there's enough for 90 entries
