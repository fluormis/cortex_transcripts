# Cortex - 108: Splitter and Lifter
**00:00:00** Am I levels good levels levels levels levels? Okay, but are they good at the level good?

**00:00:05** Look it never is immediate. What do you mean? The problem is never immediate. I have to wait for you to settle in

**00:00:13** Stop moving the desk desk doesn't well

**00:00:15** I mean this desk does move up and down but I've got a boom arm

**00:00:18** So that's not a that's not a problem meaning to ask you about your office

**00:00:26** What do you mean well, I've had it as a note in my

**00:00:29** in my personal private cortex notes

**00:00:32** Okay, that you made reference to many episodes ago now about

**00:00:38** Resetting up the office you painted it blue, right? Yeah, and that you were finding desks and stuff

**00:00:45** Yeah, and I just wondered if that has settled

**00:00:50** well, I

**00:00:52** Mean I thought it had but then I've also decided I need to rearrange everything again

**00:00:57** But it's right it so that was sort of how really unsuccessful then

**00:01:02** No, it's success. No. No, how dare you? It was successful because we're closer to you know an ultimate

**00:01:10** Perfection here, but you know not not there yet

**00:01:12** but I also need to check levels levels with you because in addition to

**00:01:17** Moving around desk stuff all the time. I've also have different audio recording stuff every time

**00:01:23** I just want to make sure like why would you have different audio recording stuff every time?

**00:01:28** Well because because of you're always trying out new things

**00:01:31** No, you tell me you tell me to buy stuff and I was like, okay, I get the boom arm and that's new right and what else is

**00:01:37** No, you know you complain about that

**00:01:39** I have the second recorder and so you know

**00:01:41** I do stuff differently then to try to satisfy you and and you know, just make everything make everything sound good

**00:01:47** So just see look you got different equipment sometimes

**00:01:50** You don't know how it sounds and that's why I wanted to check out that the levels levels are good is the way that you

**00:01:56** Purposefully obscure all the facts that I want

**00:02:00** So you say oh I'm doing things differently and I say right

**00:02:05** What are you doing differently and then you say a bunch of stuff that I already know like and you say oh

**00:02:10** Right, I get the recorder and I do that differently, you know

**00:02:13** And then just move on when you know that the piece of information

**00:02:16** I want is if you're doing something different with the actual recording. I want to know that part

**00:02:22** Oh, yeah, no stuff's different with the actual recording. Of course, that's different for sure

**00:02:26** Yeah, so well, I mean, I'm still using my I've got my trusty which what is it called here?

**00:02:31** Let me here. Let me let me pick up all the delicately connected stuff so I can read the names of it again

**00:02:35** so all right, so I'm still using my

**00:02:38** Road a one or a L dash one Al one interface that I know you love so much

**00:02:45** Because it was recommended to me as an excellent recording travel interface. So yes, I love it. It's great

**00:02:52** I've got that that's still going into the computer. That's good

**00:02:56** But the thing that you didn't like where I was oh, I had like a separate backup recorder

**00:03:00** so now what I'm doing is I've got a

**00:03:05** Splitter going from the XLR cable from the microphone

**00:03:09** That splits my audio going to the Al one road recorder which goes to the computer and

**00:03:17** Then the other half of the splitter is going toward a zoom f6 recorder that I got

**00:03:25** And so that is now the backup because my understanding is if I mess up the levels levels

**00:03:32** So that I'm peaking or that I'm too quiet the backup recording from the f6

**00:03:37** It's got more bits in it. So I should be able to always salvage that what?

**00:03:43** What did you just say there's more bits? There's more bits in the f6 zoom recorder

**00:03:49** It's more bit color depth, you know, like in an image where it's no, I know I know what you I know what you're saying

**00:03:55** Right. Okay good because I don't know what I'm saying

**00:03:58** Well, okay, I don't I know you are saying a thing that exists

**00:04:01** Maybe that helps you but my point is like even though I don't know if the 32-bit float recording is beneficial, right?

**00:04:09** If your levels are wrong there

**00:04:12** They're still wrong if you're too if you're too loud, you're too loud like that's

**00:04:19** Unsalvageable, you know

**00:04:20** No, I think it's fine. I think it's fine. I think that's what the f6 does

**00:04:24** I don't really know this equipment and I'm looking at it and as I'm looking at it thinking this is way too complicated for you

**00:04:31** And I don't know what led you to this

**00:04:35** Okay, so look so that I just I can't make you happy Mike. You don't like my

**00:04:40** Because you deserve and you don't like the f6 because it's too complicated

**00:04:46** Okay, you deserve some credit in that you will finally created the

**00:04:52** bones of a backup

**00:04:54** Recorder that I'm happy with the idea of taking your microphone and spreading it which is something I didn't even know you could do

**00:05:02** so that does make me a little nervous, but nevertheless I

**00:05:06** As a system if you if you demand to use two hardware

**00:05:11** Recorders for your backup

**00:05:13** Taking the actual microphone is good because usually you've just like oh, I've got a microphone under a book in the corner

**00:05:19** And that's what I'll use right now is pointless

**00:05:23** But so that I will give you the credit for that

**00:05:25** But now I want to come back to I'm looking at this zoom f6 product page

**00:05:30** Yeah, and I don't know why you have this very specific piece of hardware

**00:05:35** Where literally every single image on their product page is sound people on?

**00:05:41** Shooting sets using this. Yeah. Well, I mean it has six XLR inputs

**00:05:46** So that if I invite six people over to my house, which is literally never happened

**00:05:51** I could record each of them on a separate setup

**00:05:56** Products that are much more user-friendly that also have six or four or however many XLR inputs you want

**00:06:04** They're field recorders as I'm talking as I was just laughing there

**00:06:08** I'm looking at the f6 recorder and I can't tell if I'm peeking or not on it. I don't know

**00:06:11** You see what I'm saying?

**00:06:14** Who told you to buy the f6?

**00:06:17** Well cuz like I told me to buy it but so I'm looking at it now

**00:06:21** But there's two there's two places where it's displaying the input

**00:06:26** I don't know how to I don't know how to explain this you've got like two meters

**00:06:30** Yeah, there's two meters like I'm recording on channel four right and it shows channel four

**00:06:35** Why would you choose four? Which is just look can we just move past that?

**00:06:40** I'm recording on channel four and the channel four little line is going up to like minus 12

**00:06:46** Which I think is what you're supposed to aim for

**00:06:48** I really hate everything that has to do with audio or like oh, what's the how does the volume work?

**00:06:53** Oh volume goes from minus 48 to zero. See what I like about this the hardware that I use is it shows me this in lights

**00:07:01** Yeah green amber red. Yeah, does this have those?

**00:07:05** No, but the road Al one has green like when I'm talking now

**00:07:10** It's green and if I laugh it goes yellow. Yeah, and then if it's too loud, it's red

**00:07:14** Yeah, yeah, I got it. So why do you now have something that's giving you minus 12?

**00:07:19** No, okay. No, it shows a I don't know

**00:07:28** Okay, so listen listen you're derailing you're drilling the point so

**00:07:34** When I'm talking to the microphone now because that also I know Mike you want me to talk right and right into my microphone

**00:07:44** Hey, I didn't notice this before we started recording but

**00:07:47** So the channel four thing seems to be going to minus 12

**00:07:52** But then there's also a left and right and a line

**00:07:56** Indicator and those seem to be going into red territory if I laugh and I don't know which is the

**00:08:03** Maybe this is maybe this is what it has to do with the extra bits

**00:08:06** That the four channel is the extra bits channel and the left and right channel is like the traditional recording

**00:08:11** So that if it was the traditional recording, it would be peaked. I don't know. I don't know how it works

**00:08:15** I'll listen to it later and I'm sure it'll be great when we are done today

**00:08:18** Can you just send me the audio that comes from that thing?

**00:08:22** Yeah, sure. I'm just intrigued. So again, I want to ask another question. Is this the first time you've used this?

**00:08:28** No, it isn't the first time I've used it it's almost the first time

**00:08:36** No, no I was I did a test the the little stuff that I did

**00:08:41** Where I read that some some of the Halloween stories I tested the this interface this little split-up thing

**00:08:48** I tested with that Mike do you think I would I would test a brand new audio configuration up for a for a live recording?

**00:08:55** Of course, I would but I didn't do it this time. I tried it. I tried it before

**00:09:00** with something else I

**00:09:03** Still don't know why you have the f6 though

**00:09:08** This is the thing I can't work out. It has more bits. There's more bits in the audio recording

**00:09:14** So you don't have to think about like here's like I don't I don't like I don't like having to worry about

**00:09:21** All the extra details, right? So it's it's why I like the road out one because it's nice and simple

**00:09:25** And then the f6 right or is it each six? No? Yes the f6 the f6

**00:09:30** I was reading about it and it's like oh this one has more bits

**00:09:33** So you don't ever have to care about the game like just plug in the thing and don't ever worry about the gain

**00:09:38** And it'll be fine the bits will save you so it's like great. That's that's what I want

**00:09:42** I don't want to have to worry about it sounds great. I'm just I'm not saying it's not true

**00:09:47** I've just never looked into the bits before

**00:09:50** Yeah, I'm not saying it's true either because I didn't test it in any kind of rigorous way

**00:09:54** I just got it and plugged it in and and I'm just

**00:09:59** believing

**00:10:00** And I'll send you the file and you'll be the one who gets to discover whether or not it's it's real

**00:10:05** But so I did run into a problem, which I don't quite understand though

**00:10:10** Which is I think splitting the audio has made my microphone way quieter

**00:10:16** So I had to buy one of those like cloud lifter things that boosts the volume

**00:10:23** Did you check if you had phantom power turned on okay, so phantom yeah phantom power thing

**00:10:31** Yeah

**00:10:33** I was playing around with phantom power a bunch but basically yeah

**00:10:36** It seems like I don't know splitting the microphone made the microphone way quieter that makes sense though

**00:10:41** Why because it's half the volume going down one. Yeah, it's an analog signal. Oh god

**00:10:46** It is I guess it is literally an analog signal isn't it? Okay. All right, that does make more sense

**00:10:50** I forget that these XLR cables are actually analog signals

**00:10:55** Yeah, we just we put them into digital converters basically. I was this one these like facts. I love it's the headphone jack

**00:11:03** If I want to say the headphone jack was invented in like 1880. It's some ridiculously old

**00:11:09** Convention that the the standard size like headphone jack is it's like Nintendo right? It's from the 1800s headphone jack used to make playing cards

**00:11:17** Yes, that's exactly right

**00:11:19** 1877

**00:11:22** 1877 is the headphone jack. Yeah. Yeah. See there you go. Okay. All right. Well then then then that makes sense

**00:11:27** So I wasn't crazy to realize I need one of these little I still don't know how it works or what it does

**00:11:32** But one of these magic boxes that makes the microphone louder

**00:11:34** So that is new that's new this time for the first time

**00:11:38** I didn't use that when I was doing the test recording for the short stories that I read so

**00:11:43** Anyway, that that's why I wanted to know if the level sounded fine to you because it's a slightly new setup

**00:11:49** I think it's fine. It took us 10 minutes for me to find out what you'd really done

**00:11:55** Mm-hmm, because the cloud lifter is the thing I'm the most concerned about what could go wrong

**00:11:59** I mean I sound good right it did seem a little noisy when I first put it it on though

**00:12:04** There are many times where we are talking and you sound fine

**00:12:08** But the file that you provide to me of our recording not fine

**00:12:14** Hmm, you know, well, everybody already knows by now if it wasn't fine, so

**00:12:26** Anyway, how you doing Mike back in lockdown will be both are but I would assume not only my life really changed that much

**00:12:34** Yeah, I mean I I did hear that we're back in lockdown

**00:12:38** This this piece of information came to me through the grapevine

**00:12:42** I was actually talking to my parents and they think oh I heard we heard lockdown is in the UK like what's going on?

**00:12:49** What are the new rules? What do you have to do? My response was oh

**00:12:52** I don't know. I can only my house anyway

**00:12:55** I don't have any idea what I'm supposed to be doing or not be doing so I know that there is lockdown

**00:13:00** But I don't know I legitimately have no idea what the what the deets are for this lockdown

**00:13:06** So please please inform me what what are people allowed to do or not allowed to do and how is that your life?

**00:13:11** I'm not gonna answer that question. It's why because it's not important for the show, right?

**00:13:18** Okay, you could go outside but only one of a put like it's no but see the pertinent thing is I do really like how

**00:13:24** the lockdown rules seem to change in

**00:13:27** Weird in small ways constantly which mostly makes it very hard for people to comply

**00:13:33** But how are things in your life Mike the way it's affected me now is I'm at home. I'm at home right now. Oh

**00:13:40** Okay, so you are not recording from mega studio. No

**00:13:44** Hmm. Okay. Are you not allowed to go to mega studio unlike the first lockdown?

**00:13:49** The building is open. Okay. Okay. I feel like you're not answering my question there though

**00:13:54** The building I'm gonna get to it, but it's I

**00:13:59** Wanted to just lay that out was like the last time I had no choice

**00:14:03** Right, but also last time I hadn't started recording from there

**00:14:07** Right now I've had a few months of being there every day doing all my shows from there

**00:14:13** And this time they have decided not to close the building. The building is open. There are less people there, of course

**00:14:20** But I

**00:14:23** Have decided that I will record all of my shows from home

**00:14:29** Because I can

**00:14:31** Okay, the reason I left all the gear here, right? Yeah, this is the scenario that you were concerned about, right?

**00:14:36** Like you can't move everything into the office exactly for this exact moment, which has now occurred

**00:14:41** What I thought would happen didn't exactly happen and like I thought that they would say like

**00:14:46** from tomorrow, but like it you know, it was multiple days from announcing to it happening

**00:14:50** So I had multiple days of like trying to work out. Do I need to bring anything and all that kind of stuff?

**00:14:59** Effectively what I am doing is I'm over the lockdown period going to be going into the studio once or twice a week

**00:15:08** Okay to do things that I can only do there

**00:15:12** One of those things is twitch streaming. So that's something I'm doing while I am there

**00:15:17** But I also have just equipment and various things that are at the studio only that I didn't bring home

**00:15:24** So I'm going in and also, you know, I do want to go in and make sure everything is okay

**00:15:30** Right

**00:15:31** And just making sure that things are all good at the studio. What do you mean by everything is okay?

**00:15:37** Like you haven't been burglarized. Is that what you mean? No, I mean we have an alarm system for that

**00:15:42** But it's kind of just like, you know that I have so much stuff there now

**00:15:47** Like equipment and and I just want I will feel better going in and just being like we're all good here, right?

**00:15:54** You know

**00:15:55** I don't want to go there and find that there's been a leak right? Okay

**00:15:59** You know what I mean? Like I I have like value in that building

**00:16:03** Okay, you know what I mean like I have like value in that building now

**00:16:08** So I don't want to just leave it for six weeks and come back and ever and just make sure everything's good

**00:16:14** You know what? I mean? Yes

**00:16:15** I just enjoy the mental image that you that you painted here where you go. Yeah

**00:16:21** I want to go to the office and check that

**00:16:23** We're all good here and Mike is talking to the room and all of the various electronic devices are responding like oh, hey Mike

**00:16:31** How you been? Yes, we're doing great. Thanks. Everything's everything's perfectly fine

**00:16:34** Look if a Toy Story situation does occur at my studio. I do want to be there to experience it, right? Of course

**00:16:42** and then the other big thing is it's

**00:16:45** personally for my

**00:16:47** Mental well-being I want to be able to go and spend time there because I really value my time there

**00:16:53** Hmm, and I have noticed that now being back at home all the time is

**00:16:57** More difficult for me because I'm used to not being home all the time again

**00:17:02** So hmm because the first time it was difficult

**00:17:06** but now it's like a different level of difficult and everyone's dealing with their own stuff, right and I

**00:17:12** Just want to state right like I know that there are many people that have it way worse off than I do right now

**00:17:18** When in different lockdown situations and stuff like that

**00:17:22** But just for me personally and how I am doing I am finding it more difficult now

**00:17:29** to be back at home again because I was getting really into that flow of

**00:17:36** Traveling to the studio spending my time there

**00:17:39** I felt really productive there and I was getting stuff taken care of coming home and I was enjoying that split of

**00:17:47** home and office

**00:17:49** And now it kind of has all felt like it's all melded back in together again

**00:17:53** And I don't feel as productive because like if I'm at the studio and I have a bit of downtime

**00:17:58** I occupy myself with some kind of project

**00:18:01** Right, but that's not the same at home. They don't have those like projects

**00:18:07** There's no space for activities

**00:18:09** right, which is what I have at the studio and so

**00:18:12** You know, it's that the transition has been has been pretty harsh

**00:18:19** Luckily, I've had a very busy week this week. Yeah, Taylor and the last week sucked this week has been much better

**00:18:25** I've had a lot of stuff to occupy my time

**00:18:28** so it's been

**00:18:30** more manageable

**00:18:32** But just I've just made the decision that once or twice a week

**00:18:36** I'm gonna go and spend the day at the studio do some things there and then come back home again

**00:18:41** So it's the re-collapse of the separate spaces that you're finding much harder this time

**00:18:47** Yeah, cuz I've gotten used to it and loved it, you know

**00:18:50** And then I had to pull it all back again. It's like a bit of whiplash really you were able to get a taste of

**00:18:59** What it is that you wanted which is I have I have the separate spaces

**00:19:03** Which was always the goal with your current domicile that that office was going to be temporary like you got a taste of

**00:19:11** You know, we all went on the long journey with you of finding your office space and and you've set up mega studio and

**00:19:19** I guess it is a little bit like oh you got a presence, but then it was taken away and that

**00:19:26** That hurts more deeply than not having had it in the first place. Yes

**00:19:32** So yeah, I'm just I'm transitioning back

**00:19:35** It's like I'm recording we're recording this at a time when I'm feeling it the most

**00:19:41** You know, like I would expect that I'm probably gonna have a bit of a lull and I'll be okay in the middle and then towards

**00:19:46** The end I'll be like anxious to get back there again

**00:19:50** And also at the time that we're recording this I haven't been back yet

**00:19:55** Okay, so you haven't been back since the new lockdown started. No, no, so, you know, it's it's just like it's it's just difficult

**00:20:01** You know, it's just a shame because I I was really in the flow. I was really enjoying it

**00:20:06** I was loving that like they're saying like having that space that separation

**00:20:10** so it just kind of like it's a bit like

**00:20:13** man, but I

**00:20:15** Look, I could go there every day if I wanted to see my studio is open

**00:20:19** My travel is as good as it ever has been right like I as I've mentioned before like my path to getting to the studio

**00:20:27** is

**00:20:28** very socially distanced

**00:20:30** Mm-hmm, but I just felt like I want to live in the spirit of the law here

**00:20:39** You know like we're being told to stay at home, so I'll do that, you know

**00:20:45** Yeah, I mean in total fairness if the rules are you shouldn't go into work unless you absolutely have to

**00:20:53** You don't absolutely have to go into work. You can you can work from home, which is what you're doing right now and

**00:21:01** That is the idea that it's a lot of people making decisions on the margins that you know

**00:21:07** None of them individually have a huge effect, but in collectively

**00:21:11** They all increase the chance of spread even if even if like all of those travels are individually socially distanced

**00:21:18** So that does make sense that does make sense that you would you would stay at home because that is

**00:21:23** That is the correct thing to do following the the lockdown rules, but

**00:21:28** Yeah, I also I can easily imagine that

**00:21:33** For a lot of people the timing of this

**00:21:36** is also, you know, it's

**00:21:40** We're in that time of year where the Sun just disappears from the UK and

**00:21:47** I think that's that's always like an extra little kick in the shins

**00:21:51** For for this time is like oh we have the daylight savings time change and so suddenly the Sun is going down at

**00:21:59** 4 30 in the afternoon and also

**00:22:02** You know you're supposed to stay inside all the time and that is that is that is like a one two

**00:22:07** It's like a one-two punch. That's not super helpful. Yeah

**00:22:10** It's like already a time of year when people are starting to be like, oh man, and then it's like, oh man

**00:22:17** Genuinely shocking and horrifying every time this this time of year when it's like oh

**00:22:22** No more Sun for you in the evening

**00:22:24** Start getting sleepy at 4 p.m. Yeah. Oh, no, wait a minute. This is a long time to go before bedtime

**00:22:32** This episode of cortex is brought to you by team history a podcast that tells the stories of teams who work together in new and

**00:22:40** unexpected ways to achieve

**00:22:42** Remarkable things every episode of team history tells a story and in each of these stories

**00:22:47** You're gonna find practical lessons for your team and your business

**00:22:50** This season the show travels deep into underwater caves with Northern Thailand to discover how divers medics soldiers and volunteers freed a group of trapped

**00:23:00** Teenagers it explains how a world-renowned watch company pitted their two factories against each other in an attempt to become the best watchmaker

**00:23:08** In the world and also finds out how Iceland went from having one of the highest covered 19 death rates in Scandinavia

**00:23:14** To discovering an interesting example of how to deal with the virus

**00:23:17** You can discover stories that entertain that are packed with business cases

**00:23:21** You can actually use season 2 of team history is out now and it's hosted by award-winning documentary filmmaker

**00:23:27** Gabriela Koppithwaite the director of blackfish

**00:23:31** I listen to an episode which is all about an application called wild book

**00:23:34** This helps conservators and researchers keep track of wild animals like whale sharks and zebras using AI analysis of imagery

**00:23:42** So super fascinating stuff that is actually helping track these animals

**00:23:46** Which is great for conservation efforts and also for helping us understand a little bit more about the world

**00:23:51** Around us and teamistry really shows that teamwork comes in many many forms

**00:23:57** It's not just about office work by any stretch of the imagination

**00:24:00** but no matter what type of project to do in whether it's working on a pitch or a proposal or

**00:24:05** Trying to track whale sharks the same kind of problems are the things that we all face stuff like dealing with team distribution

**00:24:12** Data management communication all that stuff is explored in these episodes

**00:24:16** So go search for teamistry anywhere that you listen to podcasts so you can find a link in the show notes

**00:24:22** I'll thanks to teamistry for their support of this show every layer of them

**00:24:26** many cortex and accurately recognized that your

**00:24:30** Mysterious face mask from our last episode was the Tom bin

**00:24:35** version 3 face mask

**00:24:38** Yes, thank you to everyone for doing the the crowdsourcing on that one to find out

**00:24:45** Which mask was the one that I had ordered and then was not able to trace down like an idiot

**00:24:50** so I was very glad to know which mask it is that I liked and

**00:24:55** Just around that time when I happened to go back and check because I also wanted to order more

**00:24:59** I see that they have a they have another

**00:25:02** Iteration of this mask which I have ordered so I'm looking forward to yeah checking out the next version

**00:25:09** so I bought one of the ones you currently have the version 3 one mm-hmm and I

**00:25:16** Don't I don't think I like it very much

**00:25:19** Interesting why so there's a couple of reasons one the material is very stiff

**00:25:25** Mm-hmm, and it feels like so I am I'm a little bit more intrigued about the new one that Tom bins making the version

**00:25:31** 4 cuz it's made of flannel which I could imagine will be softer. Hmm

**00:25:36** What I don't like is how fiddly the ear adjustment thing is

**00:25:42** No, that's the best part of it. No, I know that's why you like it

**00:25:45** Right, like as soon as I put it on I was like, oh, I know why gray likes this

**00:25:49** But I I don't like it. So it's a cool feature in that it's very adjustable and it also has this like

**00:25:56** String that goes around the back of your neck so you can take the mask off and it hangs in front of you

**00:26:02** Mm-hmm

**00:26:03** But I I do not take my mask off

**00:26:07** When I'm out when I put it on to go outside and I leave it on until I'm back inside again

**00:26:13** Which I know isn't a thing that not a lot of people do

**00:26:17** Like if you're out in the street and there's no one around which keep the mask on

**00:26:21** If it Street is empty and the mask is on was the mask ever on or?

**00:26:28** I'm with you. I'm with you on this one though

**00:26:31** Like when I if I put the mask on like I just tend to leave the mask on

**00:26:36** Yeah, I just don't tend to take it on a bunch

**00:26:38** So cuz I just figured you liked it because it had that feature because that seems like one of the main features of this mask

**00:26:44** Is the fact that you could take it off and it will never use that. I literally never use that that

**00:26:50** So I don't I actually didn't even realize for a while. That's what the extra string was for

**00:26:54** I thought that that extra string was just a side effect of adjusting the fit on your ears

**00:26:58** Yeah, you see because what I don't like I don't like the fiddliness is that like every time I put this mask on

**00:27:03** I have to readjust it and

**00:27:06** That annoys me that is every time like it's always like off on one side

**00:27:11** Yeah, but you're not putting it on and off a lot, right?

**00:27:14** That's the whole thing you you put it on you cinch it make it the right size so it fits on your ears

**00:27:18** It actually covers your whole face

**00:27:20** Like all these masks for ants which barely cover your face at all and if you try to talk that is a good part of it

**00:27:26** It's big. Yeah, it's nice and big and the version 4 looks like it's even bigger

**00:27:29** I'm very happy to see the thing for me though is when I go out, right if I'm going to the studio

**00:27:34** I am taking on and off the mask multiple times a day, right?

**00:27:39** Because I'll wear it to go to the studio if I go out from the studio

**00:27:43** I'll put it on again

**00:27:45** It's just I don't like that every time I put it on even if it was just every day and I have to adjust it

**00:27:51** It's not that's not for me. I don't think but I I do want to know what you think the version for one

**00:27:57** Because the fabric does look really nice

**00:28:01** So yeah, no it looks good. It looks like it's a big mask that actually covers your whole face properly again

**00:28:07** That's just my main thing is that all the other masks? I just I felt like they were constantly falling off my face or not

**00:28:13** Really not really covering me

**00:28:14** So that's that's the main thing with this and and is also why I'm very glad that the cortex has figured out which mask I bought

**00:28:20** So that I could buy some more but yeah

**00:28:22** I'm very happy with it and they're also talking in the version for one about doing more for

**00:28:28** glasses fogging. Oh

**00:28:30** Yeah, yeah, which is always an annoyance for me

**00:28:35** Wait, do your actual glasses fog or do you mean sunglasses? No my glasses, huh?

**00:28:41** How does that happen? What do you mean weird? Why?

**00:28:46** Why is this weird I

**00:28:48** Only have this problem if I'm wearing sunglasses right this because your glasses your glasses glasses are smaller than mine

**00:28:54** Are they I guess they are I have large glasses, right? So like they will be more I guess

**00:29:00** similar in shape to your sunglasses

**00:29:03** Hmm, how are they trying to solve this the glasses fogging problem?

**00:29:08** Which is technology which is probably one of the biggest unexpected problems facing the world in 2020

**00:29:13** Yeah, like hey glasses fogging when you wear masks

**00:29:17** Suddenly is like on the top 10 list of problems that civilization is trying to deal with like no one would have predicted that a year

**00:29:23** ago, oh

**00:29:25** They're doing something with the nose bridge

**00:29:28** Hmm, which apparently is better that there's no seam in it in the actual bridge of the nose

**00:29:33** But they say but I don't know I at this point though

**00:29:37** I've tried multiple face masks that tell me that they're there they won't fog my glasses and they all do and they all do

**00:29:43** Yeah, but I think I found my favorites. Okay, so one is follow up the atoms masks came

**00:29:50** And I really like those as like I like those more than the Adidas ones

**00:29:54** Okay, so for that type of mask that like the spongy material, however, you would call it

**00:30:00** I like that a lot but adena was looking in which magazine if you don't know what which is I think there's a thing in

**00:30:07** America called consumer reports. I was like you said which in a way that felt like I should know what it is

**00:30:12** You know what which magazine is we've had this conversation before haven't we?

**00:30:16** If we have I totally don't remember it's like the old-school wire cutter

**00:30:21** We did have this conversation. Okay, and she found these masks by a company called

**00:30:27** I don't know. It's any QI I guess and they're available in a bunch of like supermarkets and stuff here. They're just fantastic

**00:30:35** They're so good. They're big

**00:30:38** They're like one of the bigger masks that I found covers my whole like face including my beard

**00:30:44** the material is

**00:30:46** thick but really breathable and

**00:30:49** They're just very very comfortable and these are easily my favorites and there's like here

**00:30:56** They're 15 pounds for three of them

**00:30:58** Which also felt pretty good compared to some of the other prices that I've paid for decent face masks. So

**00:31:04** As a long like I figure this is gonna keep coming up, but these are currently my favorites. Yeah. No, I'll give them a try

**00:31:11** I'll just see what they're like. Even if you had them as like

**00:31:15** Emergency masks, you know like oh I've run out and I need some cuz there's you know, they're pretty I think they're pretty good value

**00:31:21** Yeah, the only thing that I would dock

**00:31:24** The Tom bin masks for is that I do feel like they're not the most breathable mask every once in a while

**00:31:31** I do I do feel a little bit like oh, I hope I don't asphyxiate to death while wearing this mask and walking briskly

**00:31:37** That's what I meant about like the thickness

**00:31:40** Like the rigidness of the material

**00:31:42** Which is why I liked the the Adidas ones and the Athens ones because they were very breathable

**00:31:47** And I know that there is like a problem like when you think about breathable and what the masks are for

**00:31:54** like I get the weird like

**00:31:57** oxymoron in there, but nevertheless

**00:32:00** You know, but yeah, but but yeah, but nevertheless this is this is something that we need to solve

**00:32:07** Yeah, right

**00:32:07** Like yes a mask that was perfectly sculpted to your face and made out of lead would guarantee that no germ particles got through

**00:32:15** But that's not the only thing that we're trying to optimize for here. Yeah, I like these ones

**00:32:20** I recommend you try them because they're very available here in the UK. So I recommend you try them

**00:32:26** Okay, I'll give them a try. Thank you

**00:32:33** Mike we'll know when the coronavirus is over because there's never any more mask recommendations on the show

**00:32:40** That's what we'll know. It's done interesting

**00:32:42** I still feel like I'm going to be a relatively frequent mask person you think it's gonna stick around

**00:32:49** I don't know if it's going to stick around but I think it's gonna stick around for Mike Hurley

**00:32:59** I hope there are many people like you Mike. I don't think there's a lot of downside. Yeah. Yeah, there's only upside

**00:33:07** Get sick less awesome. All right, like and I like wearing

**00:33:13** Uh-huh. So, you know like if I'm traveling especially I'll wear them and like if I'm just popping to Tesco's in the future

**00:33:21** I probably won't but if I'm going somewhere for a while and I know I'm gonna be interacting with a bunch of people in

**00:33:28** confined spaces

**00:33:30** Like I don't see there being any harm in it all like and it's you know

**00:33:35** I know I understand some people do find it uncomfortable or would prefer to not wear them, but I'm not one of those people

**00:33:42** Mm-hmm. I

**00:33:44** Hope there are enough people who are like you because I I agree

**00:33:48** I would I would like to do this, but I do think that there that becomes just

**00:33:56** Social awkwardness and difficulty if the number of people who wear masks

**00:34:01** Drops below a certain percentage of the population

**00:34:04** right like what if I'm going to an airport in the future if

**00:34:08** Five percent of the people there are wearing masks great, then there's no problem

**00:34:12** But if you're the only person who wants to wear a mask in an airport

**00:34:15** I think it just becomes weird and you just draw a lot of attention to yourself and social awkwardness and

**00:34:25** Right. It's it's not good. Yeah, I'm hoping like it doesn't drop below 5% let's say of it's unusual

**00:34:32** but not

**00:34:34** remarkable is the

**00:34:37** Optimal level that I kind of want to hit with this

**00:34:39** But I don't have a lot of I don't have a lot of faith in masks sticking around

**00:34:46** unless

**00:34:48** Clothing manufacturing companies can convince everyone that this is just a new piece of fashion that everyone needs to have

**00:34:55** And so they can keep selling them, but maybe that'll work

**00:34:59** Also like when I have a mask that I like I think they look cool

**00:35:04** Like you know, I see it as like yeah, this is I think this is fashionable

**00:35:08** Mmm, and so I can imagine that being an accessory for people for I can't I can't get on board with that

**00:35:14** I mean human fashions are weird, but I don't know I have a hard time imagining

**00:35:20** The masks sticking around as a fashion item, and that's just you know every now and then you get prime gray quotes

**00:35:29** Yeah, human fashions are weird

**00:35:32** Definitely one of them, but they are weird I don't disagree

**00:35:37** But I would not phrase it that way human fashions

**00:35:41** speaking of which

**00:35:42** Cortex-merch.com

**00:35:44** Cortex-merch.com human fashions for sale human fashions on sale now my

**00:35:51** Genuinely my favorite thing that we have produced in the clothing realm has been the subtlety

**00:36:00** Which if you are new or you are forgotten is a t-shirt a very

**00:36:06** Very lovely t-shirt with a tasteful classy embroidered

**00:36:10** Cortex logo on it, and I think it looks really great looks great in any situation

**00:36:15** And it's an item of clothing that I wear frequently

**00:36:18** I have been wearing the sweater version which we debuted later on very frequently recently actually

**00:36:24** And something that I would wear most days while at mega studio is the subtle sweater, and I thought to myself

**00:36:33** We've only ever done this in blue. It looks like I wear the same sweater every day

**00:36:39** Even though I own like five of them

**00:36:42** And I thought to myself why haven't we done more colors so more colors?

**00:36:48** You can now buy at Cortex merch.com

**00:36:53** the subtlety and subtle sweater in the traditional blue but now a black option and

**00:37:00** a red slash burgundy option depending on whether you go for the t-shirt or the

**00:37:05** Sweater itself the embroidery is blue on all of them

**00:37:09** And we worked with our friends at cotton bureau on choosing very particular colors that we thought the blue stitching

**00:37:56** I'm not sure sometimes. I'm not sure if you're going to do the calm now Mike like so I don't work particularly long to throw you off

**00:38:03** Oh, okay, and I came in just at the right moment. Okay, you just wanted to cut me off. That's what that was. Yeah

**00:38:10** All right mission accomplished

**00:38:12** As I was getting ready for the show today

**00:38:16** Mm-hmm. I thought to myself

**00:38:19** This isn't an episode out of time. No, why would you think it?

**00:38:23** He was but we are recording it at such a point that it kind of feels like it why I don't understand that at all

**00:38:28** So as we are recording this episode

**00:38:33** My iPhone is due to arrive tomorrow

**00:38:36** Oh, we will not release the episode until next week

**00:38:40** Okay, when there's also going to be new max which we'll talk about in a little bit and we are in between

**00:38:47** them being announced and released and

**00:38:51** Our next couple of episodes are going to be special episodes

**00:38:56** so

**00:38:58** Okay, really follow up on these products. I don't think in the main show at least

**00:39:04** Maybe we'll talk a little bit more tax. I'm not promising that but it's possible

**00:39:10** so I

**00:39:11** Figured I wanted to touch on both

**00:39:13** New iPhones and new max just to see if you've made decisions and get your opinions

**00:39:18** But see what I mean, it feels weird because it's like if we did it on the next episode

**00:39:24** If we were making purchases, we'd have all the stuff but

**00:39:28** Right, but our next two episodes are blocked out. Yeah, it's not gonna happen. Okay, I see what you mean. Yeah

**00:39:33** So it's like this weird. I want to just talk about them for a little bit

**00:39:38** But it has got this kind of weird feeling of like it's probably the worst time to talk about these things

**00:39:45** Yeah, it's more like an episode before time it's it's the episode that time forgot. Yeah, did you order an iPhone?

**00:39:57** Mike I believe last time I discussed the loop that I was stuck in. Mm-hmm

**00:40:04** going round and round then round and round and

**00:40:07** I thought perhaps

**00:40:09** Discussing that conundrum on the show might help, you know

**00:40:13** How you know how sometimes when you're thinking about something it really helps to say it out loud to another person and you can come to

**00:40:19** This realization of like oh while I'm explaining this to someone else the decision becomes obvious

**00:40:25** but this decision did not become obvious when I was talking about it last time on Cortex and

**00:40:31** I saw there were many comments along the same lines in the reddit after the show

**00:40:37** Which I do were inevitably coming where people are like, oh

**00:40:41** But doesn't gray know that one phone is none phone. Why not get both phones? Oh, God

**00:40:47** and

**00:40:49** while I did

**00:40:51** Appreciate the the spirit in which those comments were made feel like they don't get to the heart of the actual problem

**00:40:57** Which is yes, that is a fun idea

**00:41:00** But it's a fun idea that just introduces way more problems than it's worth

**00:41:03** You don't want to have to be deciding which phone are you taking out for the day?

**00:41:07** Like what a nightmarish way to live your life. Yeah the multi phone lifestyle

**00:41:12** I feel like it adds a lot more complications. Yeah, then multi iPad does yeah, it's not helpful in

**00:41:20** most scenarios and it's

**00:41:23** Particularly not helpful if one of the primary differences between the phones is that there's there's a camera difference

**00:41:30** so that what you're actually having to make a decision about is oh

**00:41:34** I'm going out for the day. Will I want to take photos on this outing? Like well

**00:41:40** I don't know because I can't see into the future

**00:41:43** I don't know if something really interesting is going to happen and then I want the better camera, right?

**00:41:48** What what a nightmare like you can only then introduce the possibility of regret

**00:41:53** Every day that you step outside your house if you take the quote wrong phone

**00:41:58** But I just I just wanted to address the many many comments that people are like great. He's gonna get two phones

**00:42:03** No, he won't he's not gonna get two phones. But yes, I spent literally days

**00:42:08** continuing to cycle round and

**00:42:11** It's just very unlike me. I can usually break out of these these little loops

**00:42:16** but I was completely unable to do it, but

**00:42:20** eventually

**00:42:22** Eventually, I settled on

**00:42:26** Ordering a phone and I ordered the big phone. Oh

**00:42:30** The max, okay

**00:42:32** What now now, what do you think about this Mike? Do you think that was the correct decision? Do you think that was not the correct decision?

**00:42:39** Yeah, exactly

**00:42:41** so

**00:42:42** We was you know, we were we were thinking okay

**00:42:46** The new it has a new camera. The camera is better, right?

**00:42:50** Mm-hmm, and that that was the reason to get the phone. Mm-hmm. Now the reviews of the phone

**00:42:57** By and large are saying yeah, the camera is better

**00:43:02** But it is not

**00:43:04** Dramatically better. Mm-hmm. Right like there are improvements for sure

**00:43:09** especially in low-light scenarios all stuff that makes sense and that you know the idea if you

**00:43:17** Want to have the best camera? This is the one because it is a little bit better

**00:43:24** If you were basing your decision

**00:43:27** And you were like, ah, I'm not sure if I want the big phone, but I do want the best camera

**00:43:33** I think this is a little bit trickier

**00:43:35** But if you're like me where it's like I'm always getting the big phone then it's great

**00:43:41** I have a bonus the cameras a little bit better, right?

**00:43:43** Exactly, but if you were may say basing your decision on I'm getting the big phone

**00:43:51** It's a little trickier when the camera is not 87% better when the sensors 87% bigger, you know

**00:43:59** Now like I'm always gonna want big phone big phone big screen bigger screen beautiful phone big camera good camera

**00:44:11** That's fantastic that was like

**00:44:13** iPhone slam poetry review. That's what you just did there

**00:44:18** Big screen big phone

**00:44:21** Better phone then you take a drag on your cigarette and then a bongo. Yeah

**00:44:27** So, yeah, I don't know I don't know for you I really don't know I don't know for me either

**00:44:33** And yeah, so I ordered it because I thought

**00:44:36** my reasoning was I

**00:44:39** Need to know right so I'll just put in the I'll put in the order for the big phone

**00:44:44** But yes, the the initial reviews have come out and people are saying that the camera is better

**00:44:49** It's not significantly better. The one thing that I'm still waiting for. I just haven't seen enough reviews of it yet is

**00:44:56** Most people are talking about photos and it's like yeah, I do care about photos

**00:45:00** But I'm actually way more concerned about the video quality and I haven't seen a lot of great reviews comparing

**00:45:07** the video quality of one to the other so that that's still a little bit of an open question, but I

**00:45:13** figured

**00:45:14** I'll try the big phone because then if I decide that I don't want it and I return it at least I will have the

**00:45:22** The assurance of knowing it feels like it would be an easier decision to

**00:45:28** Leave the big phone and leave the small phone. Yes. Yes. Yes

**00:45:33** I think yeah trying what you're trying to do is like minimize future regret

**00:45:38** Right. Whereas if I buy the medium phone straight away

**00:45:42** You're basically guaranteeing that there's always going to be a small amount of but what if regret so I'm trying to I'm trying to minimize that

**00:45:51** but I was so uncertain and so frustrated that what I've what I've actually done is I had an old iPhone X

**00:46:00** Max lying around the house and I

**00:46:05** Downgraded my current phone to that phone to try to pre get used to the big size

**00:46:12** Warming up. Yeah, that's exactly it. I figured here's here's what I want to do. I want when the phone does arrive

**00:46:18** I'm not completely shocked by how large it is. It can just be oh

**00:46:24** It's it's a tiny bit larger than the phone that I'm currently using and it has the nice flat sides

**00:46:30** I'm not doing I'm not doing this now to try and be like, oh you can't get it right

**00:46:34** But I'm just asking you you you're using a 10s max not a 10, right? I

**00:46:40** Don't know. Well, cuz the 10s max is bigger than the 10

**00:46:46** Because you said

**00:46:48** X max which didn't exist. So it was one size of the 10 the 10

**00:46:54** God damn it. I don't look who can remember I don't I can't it's just because the reason I want to know is because if you're

**00:46:58** Using a 10 if you are using a 10, which I don't think you are but if you are

**00:47:02** It's gonna be a massive jump up to the 12 pro max in size

**00:47:06** No, I mean look it's a it's a phone with a notch. That's big. That's what I'm using. It's okay

**00:47:11** I'm sure then you I'm pretty confident in using a tennis max and I'm really not trying to be like

**00:47:16** Oh, oh good. I'll get the names right. It's just wanted to like because if if you're setting yourself up with a 10

**00:47:21** It's still not good enough. You know, what do you think? What do you think I've done over here?

**00:47:25** Mike like I loaded my phone onto my old mini and I thought that it was the big one

**00:47:31** Ten the ten was bigger but it's not was it max kind of sizes that's like

**00:47:38** regular 12 size

**00:47:40** Mm-hmm, you know

**00:47:42** Okay. Well here

**00:47:43** I know that I wasn't that far off because I loaded my phone onto an old big one to try to get used to it and

**00:47:49** Then Apple and in their annoying benevolence that to deal with their own logistics problems

**00:47:56** Did send me the case that I ordered for the phone three weeks ahead of whenever I'm gonna get the actual phone. Yeah

**00:48:02** Yeah, I have mine here too

**00:48:04** So the case has arrived and the case is not that much bigger than right the actual phone that I'm using

**00:48:10** How big is the camera cut out the camera cut out is enormous. It's ginormous

**00:48:16** huge

**00:48:18** Phone in there and I was like, oh my god, it's like twice the size

**00:48:23** Yeah, yeah, it's it's a very big camera cut out which also there is a little part of me

**00:48:28** Which is just wondering if some of the initial reviews that the photos aren't that much better

**00:48:35** the fact the camera cutout is

**00:48:38** significantly bigger it makes me wonder if they're just some software tweaks that are coming down the line that haven't been

**00:48:44** Implemented yet like who knows I just I find it weird. It's like oh if the camera the the photos don't seem

**00:48:51** Obviously better, but they they did go to the trouble of manufacturing a physical larger camera casing, which I just wasn't expecting

**00:48:59** I don't know. I just find I find that interesting. Yeah, all it's like this stuff. Everything's bigger

**00:49:03** That's the thing right? Like yeah, the lenses are bigger the senses bigger like everything's bigger

**00:49:07** And this was something that kind of didn't come across

**00:49:10** Yes until reviewers started getting the devices I mean and there were so they're like interesting quirks right where like

**00:49:18** Night mode comes on less often. Mm-hmm, you know, there's little things like that where it's like, okay

**00:49:24** This is interesting and I'm keen to see

**00:49:27** When Apple creates their raw format and when that when that comes out to the world the pro raw thing, right?

**00:49:35** What are the differences like there if any like, you know, I'm just I'm king

**00:49:38** Yeah, but like for me, I want the best camera. Mm-hmm. It's just something that I want. It's my camera and so I will

**00:49:46** Happily keep with the with the phone that I like for that camera anyway, right? Yeah

**00:49:51** Yeah, and you are also lucky because since you also just had the assurance of your decision

**00:49:56** You were able to place an order at a reasonable time. And so you're getting your phone tomorrow

**00:50:01** Whereas my my indecision cost me weeks of shipping deadlines

**00:50:06** The best time to talk about it because we'll talk about the phone when you get yours next in 2021

**00:50:13** Yeah

**00:50:13** it may well be that we can record two more episodes of cortex before I actually get the phone because I was because I was

**00:50:20** Just going back and forth. Oh big phone little phone medium phone. Hmm in an endless circle

**00:50:27** So I'm happy you're getting your phone tomorrow. I'll be very curious to see what you think of it

**00:50:31** Yeah, that that mini seems really many too many for me

**00:50:35** Well, yeah, no, you're you're a big phone boy

**00:52:15** So we just had the M1 the Apple Silicon

**00:52:19** announcement

**00:52:20** New Mac, Mac Pro, new Mac mini

**00:52:23** Yes

**00:52:25** What do you think of this? Did you watch the event?

**00:52:28** Even though you were very good Mike and you reminded me I completely forgot about the event

**00:52:33** Until the next I'm sorry

**00:52:38** Just I just felt like you you were being diligent to him like don't forget there's an Apple event

**00:52:43** I was like, oh, don't worry. I remember and then I forgot so I didn't I didn't watch the actual thing I

**00:52:51** Intended to watch it

**00:52:52** But of course once it had broadcast as usual I was like, oh, I just want to see like what are the actual products?

**00:52:58** Yeah, and it's just an odd

**00:53:02** lineup of

**00:53:04** products and

**00:53:05** So I ended up just trying to find out some some more details about it and quickly came to the conclusion

**00:53:11** they're like I don't actually need to

**00:53:13** Watch this event because I don't think there's more information in here than I'm finding about

**00:53:20** These Macs, so I'm coming at it from a slightly odd perspective

**00:53:26** Very weird perspective. But yes, well what I mean is what I mean is like when I was googling around

**00:53:31** I'm quickly seeing like, okay

**00:53:32** Here are the Bezos charts that people who were trying to find out more information were screenshotting and you know

**00:53:38** Like what the hell does this mean? It's like, okay, if this is the best people can do if I watch it

**00:53:42** I'm not gonna figure out more stuff

**00:53:44** Unlike the iPhone event where it's like I want to hear very carefully what they're saying about the cameras

**00:53:49** You know, so it's just a different kind. Yeah, I can understand that to a point and I think a lot of the really interesting

**00:53:56** Stuff about these products is once they start landing in people's hands and seeing what people can actually do with them

**00:54:01** Yeah, so I don't know my initial impression is

**00:54:06** They seem like

**00:54:09** Very much like transition machines. Yeah, I mean would you agree with that? Like well, they definitely are because

**00:54:17** They are they look exactly the same as the products they replace

**00:54:21** They just have some changes to the internals any Apple

**00:54:25** Historian will tell you this is exactly what they did when they moved to Intel like the first round of products

**00:54:31** Were just the same product that they were already selling of a new chip inside of it

**00:54:35** And it is most likely that the next set of max which will come out maybe sometime in the spring

**00:54:43** Will be the first to look any different

**00:54:46** So yeah, I'm a for example is is very very likely to be the first Mac to get a new design

**00:54:54** and that computer

**00:54:57** Will not have an M1 in it. I'm almost convinced of that. You mean that you think it will have a different Apple produced chip

**00:55:03** Yes, it will have either

**00:55:06** something maybe an M2 or an M1 X or something like that and there are

**00:55:11** various interesting reasons why that would be the case and once you start understanding these reasons and

**00:55:18** Getting to talk to people. I mean I've had the chance to interview some executives at Apple again people that worked on these chips. It's

**00:55:26** When when we released this so I have an issue coming out tomorrow

**00:55:29** So Tuesday on a show called upgrade. I'll put a link in the show notes that people want to check it out

**00:55:35** Basically the M1 chip

**00:55:38** Fits in these three products, which is why we have them because they have the M1 chip has some limitations to it

**00:55:46** But these limitations are perfect for the MacBook Air the entry Mac mini and the entry Mac Pro

**00:55:53** Hmm and these limitations seem to be they can have two USB for ports

**00:56:00** USB for by the way includes thunderbolt. This is really took me a while to get my head around this

**00:56:05** It's the same connector

**00:56:06** But it's USB for slash thunderbolt because USB the USB for spec includes everything from the ball could do

**00:56:13** Which does mean gray that as we move to USB for things will become easier

**00:56:18** Because you won't have to decide if it's USB C or Thunderbolt anymore, right?

**00:56:23** Because if it's us before it can do all of it. Yes. Yes

**00:56:27** Fantastic. We had we had too many standards now, but don't worry the new standard will unify all the old standards

**00:56:32** Sure USB 5 will add some new capabilities

**00:56:36** Yeah, and then the other thing is maximum 16 gigabytes of what is now called unified memory. Mmm

**00:56:43** But that is RAM. Yeah. Yeah, that's interesting to hear you say that and you got this from the interview that you did on upgrade

**00:56:51** Is that what you're saying that that's where this is coming from some of this information came from the interview

**00:56:55** Some information is gleaned and some comes from other places right comes from some other places

**00:57:01** Yes. All right. Well that makes that makes perfect sense then because looking at this

**00:57:05** I think the reason why it strikes me is just a bit, huh?

**00:57:09** Is the is that fact that you know, the 13 inch laptop is the laptop that I'm always the most interested in like that's that's

**00:57:16** The one that I want and they always have had to two tiers of 13 inch

**00:57:21** Yes

**00:57:21** And it's it is quite striking that they only updated the low tier of the 13 inch

**00:57:28** Yep, because they couldn't put four Thunderbolt ports on in it. Right? Okay, that makes sense if they're if they couldn't do for

**00:57:35** USB-C 4

**00:57:38** This poor USB 4 they say see cuz now you're confusing it but yes sure

**00:57:44** But this is why you can still buy the Intel MacBook Pro

**00:57:50** Right, right. Okay, that's interesting. So you can still buy the Intel MacBook Pro

**00:57:55** You can still buy the Intel Mac Mini. You cannot buy an Intel MacBook Air because the M1

**00:58:00** Has been able to completely replace all of the functionality of the MacBook Air line, right?

**00:58:06** Okay. Okay

**00:58:08** Because I'm gonna get more than two ports on a MacBook Air

**00:58:11** I mean the one thing that it has lost out is I think you could do more than 16 gigabytes of RAM

**00:58:16** Yeah, but I'm really interested to see so one of the things I'm still struggling to get my head around is this idea of

**00:58:24** Unified system memory because it's it's quite complicated, but it's we don't really think about

**00:58:31** RAM in the same way anymore because this memory pool

**00:58:37** Can be used by the CPU and by graphics, right? It's all the same

**00:58:41** Nothing has to be copied and passed through the system. It's just all there to be taken from which apparently

**00:58:48** Gives you lots of efficiency gains. This is the thing that I'm really intrigued about is like

**00:58:53** The 16 gigabytes of unified memory feel like 16 gigabytes of RAM

**00:58:59** But does it feel like something else and that's what I'm really intrigued to try out. Yeah

**00:59:04** From my initial reading around this is one thing

**00:59:07** I thought straight away is I will totally give Apple the benefit of the doubt on this one

**00:59:12** Yes, that's the that the 16 gigs of RAM perfectly makes sense as soon as when I first saw it was a limitation

**00:59:18** I was like what the hell 16 gigs. You gotta be crazy. Yeah, but then when I was at wait

**00:59:22** Oh, they built it into the CPU is like, oh

**00:59:25** Okay, this is a very Apple thing to do and and and I know like a lot of nerds go crazy

**00:59:31** Because Apple doesn't like to talk about specs

**00:59:35** But this is one area where Apple has a lot of crazy

**00:59:41** advantages in

**00:59:43** Making the parts of their system work together so that the specs are less relevant

**00:59:49** and

**00:59:51** Like this I will totally give them credit here and it's for me that the thing about the these machines that I'm most

**00:59:58** curious about and and

**00:59:59** Like just this morning. It seems like some of the benchmarks are coming out which we can talk about in a second

**01:00:05** But they shouldn't but they are yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, this yeah, this is the whatever that website is where they're like

**01:00:11** Oh, yes. Thank you where we could see people are benchmarking their machines on our website and we did the sign any non-disclosure agreement

**01:00:18** so the thing that I'm really interested in to see like once the embargoes lift or once people start testing stuff is

**01:00:26** So just like with the phone. My only concern each year is is the camera better

**01:00:32** I have a similar thing with the computers and in particular with the laptops, which is I

**01:00:39** Want to know about final cut performance?

**01:00:42** Like this is the only piece of information that I'm interested in about your new machines

**01:00:48** And

**01:00:49** This is one of these cases where I just think

**01:00:52** Specs don't actually tell you anything and it's why when we were talking about the Mac Pro when it came out a couple years ago

**01:00:59** I was like Apple is totally gunning for

**01:01:04** being the company that supplies

**01:01:06** all of the solutions for the entertainment industry as a whole and it was because like oh in that Mac Pro

**01:01:14** They built in like special graphics cards that only handle rendering final cut files and it's like, whoa

**01:01:22** Okay, you know, that's a huge deal. And so I just I look at this computer and I think

**01:01:30** Final cut is one of those products where it's like, okay Apple makes the product itself

**01:01:36** I think this is an area that they care a lot about

**01:01:39** They're also making the silicon chips that final cut is running on on the laptop

**01:01:45** And I just I feel like whatever benchmarks are saying I want to see like how does final cut perform?

**01:01:52** And it's it's one of these areas where I think

**01:01:55** They might have a lot more gains than it than it seems like just by looking at the raw numbers

**01:02:00** And I do think people who are freaking out about small amounts of RAM are like, I don't know

**01:02:05** I'm gonna give Apple the benefit of the doubt on this one with their chip and the integration like I think the integration

**01:02:11** Counts for a lot more than than people think it does

**01:02:14** But you know, I don't know we're again, we're talking at a really undetermined time right now

**01:02:19** Yeah, I can't wait to see people testing these new chips with final cut render and like processing time

**01:02:27** That's the stuff I'm more interested about then the raw numbers that Geekbench produces

**01:02:32** But they are still interesting for context because they're so weird and we'll touch on them in a second

**01:02:38** But during the presentation Apple did call out

**01:02:41** Faster render times in Final Cut. You know, I just think I mean they the comparison that they did is it was six times

**01:02:48** Faster, but this you know, they were doing it on a very specifically spec Mac mini is

**01:02:54** The small print to it, but I would expect that you would see better performance

**01:02:59** I I'm I would be very confident to put some money down

**01:03:03** That you would see better performance on a MacBook Air with an M1 chip in Final Cut

**01:03:08** Then you get on your do you have a 16 inch Mac Pro?

**01:03:12** Yeah, that's probably my fastest laptop. Yeah. Yeah, and I bet you'll get better performance because

**01:03:17** The MacBook Air in Geekbench scores higher than the 16 inch Mac Pro

**01:03:23** Okay. Now wait when you say the MacBook Air is that because the

**01:03:27** Benchmarks have leaked out for the MacBook Air as opposed to the 13 Pro or we just saying like this is the same CPU

**01:03:33** And so you're using it interchangeably. They've leaked out for everything

**01:03:37** But they're very similar

**01:03:38** Geekbench scores

**01:03:40** There's a good reason for that because you know, the MacBook Pro and the Mac mini have fans in them

**01:03:44** So when you're doing things like rendering they are going to be better over that sustained period of time because the thermal

**01:03:51** Throttling won't kick in. Yeah, it's gonna be any and right now

**01:03:54** We don't know what that's like with Geekbench won't give you those kinds of results

**01:03:58** I bring up the MacBook Air just because it's funny to say

**01:04:02** Okay, it's funny to say yeah. No the MacBook Air is not a great machine to always do renderings

**01:04:08** No, and they took the fan out of this one gray. I don't know if you knew that. Okay, interesting

**01:04:12** No, I didn't know that because they they don't need it which makes sense

**01:04:15** Right, like the fan isn't needed anymore because this thing is so efficient. Mmm

**01:04:20** So they're taking it out and now it's silent and then it also gives them a point of contention between the MacBook Air

**01:04:26** And the MacBook Pro because otherwise

**01:04:28** In many ways they are functionally the same now. Yeah fan in it and it will

**01:04:34** Sustain a tough workload for longer. Yeah, sustainability totally matters

**01:04:38** Like I yeah, I've definitely tried to render stuff on low-end laptops

**01:04:43** And like you start to see the battery drain because like you can't even pull power fast

**01:04:47** That was always the thing with the MacBook. You try and render something on Final Cut and not even plug it in it would keep its

**01:04:53** Charge. Yeah, just like uh-oh, which is gonna run out first

**01:04:56** Like am I gonna get to the end of this render or is this battery gonna drop to nothing?

**01:05:00** but it's interesting because even if they said if they say on stage Oh render times are six times faster and

**01:05:06** Then the reality for my particular situation is oh, it's only twice as fast

**01:05:11** It's like twice as fast totally matters

**01:05:13** Like I have I have had even if this is just just like a dumb example

**01:05:17** But just for the little Halloween stories that I read like I really wanted to upload them on

**01:05:21** Halloween and I had to

**01:05:23** re-render them a couple times for reasons that don't matter and I just made it within

**01:05:28** 30 minutes of the end of Halloween by the end of the day and it's like

**01:05:32** Those render times really matter sometimes when like you want to upload something on a particular day and like twice as fast as a

**01:05:39** No-brainer business decision to be like worth it sold. So that's that's very interesting to hear

**01:05:45** Yeah, so, you know like how high these machines end up being for like processor single-core stuff

**01:05:52** I mean, it's interesting

**01:05:54** You know and if it is the highest or if it's way up there, it's that's great

**01:05:58** I mean, but there's more to the story than that, right? But the reason people are

**01:06:03** Mentioning this is even a thing of like, oh, you know if you take all of Apple's computers

**01:06:08** The MacBook Air is only lower in benchmarks

**01:06:12** Then like the iMac Pro and the Mac Pro the only thing sitting above it, right? It's bananas, right?

**01:06:18** This is the entry-level laptop

**01:06:20** That is crazy. That is really crazy

**01:06:22** Right

**01:06:23** And so like the reason people are pointing out the reason we're talking about it

**01:06:26** Like I never talk about cute bench scores because they don't really mean anything to me

**01:06:31** But I will talk about them if they're interesting anomalies and this is that right and I think what it says is

**01:06:39** the future of the Mac platform is

**01:06:42** very different now to what we have seen in the past where

**01:06:47** It is conceivable that Apple will be producing the most powerful computers within this two-year timeframe

**01:06:55** Yeah, and that is

**01:06:57** Really weird to think about like what is the Mac Pro going to be capable of when they move it to this

**01:07:04** This architecture. Yeah, I am extraordinarily happy that Apple is doing their own silicon stuff

**01:07:10** And it does feel like you know, you you had your ear of positivity

**01:07:15** you know when everyone was really grumpy about everything that was going on particularly in Mac land and

**01:07:20** It does feel like there was this time when we were walking through the Valley of the shadow of death for Mac and

**01:07:28** We've we've been out of there for a little while the transition to Apple silicon really feels like ah now

**01:07:35** I have the rod and the staff for like the future of what this is going to be

**01:07:39** Yeah, and it is it is really interesting to see where this goes this machine costs

**01:07:47** $999 right

**01:07:48** Yeah, and any will outperform a machine that starts at

**01:07:56** $2,400

**01:07:58** Right, right. That's quite a thing

**01:08:00** you know the the Mac Pro is not a machine for me for a bunch of reasons like I'm not interested in it, but like

**01:08:08** God damn am I going to be interested to see when they finally revise that thing for their own silicon chips like

**01:08:16** What what kind of crazy craze supercomputer are they going to be selling?

**01:08:22** It's it's going to be really interesting to get there

**01:08:24** There is a rumor that they are working on a smaller Mac Pro

**01:08:29** Hmm as potentially a secondary machine in that line

**01:08:34** Hmm like a like a little like a little trashcan sized cylinder like that sort of that's sort of smaller

**01:08:40** I would expect it would look like the current one but smaller

**01:08:45** Hmm and that seems like a fascinating computer, right? Mm-hmm. Yeah, baby

**01:08:52** Yeah, I have no idea what what this architecture is going to scale up to or how they're going to produce a

**01:09:01** desk the desktop machines like what they're going to be capable of

**01:09:05** But what they have shown so far is an is an incredibly intriguing start

**01:09:11** So are you going to get one I have ordered a MacBook Pro, yeah

**01:09:16** Okay, so you you ordered the 13 inch MacBook Pro. Yeah, what did you did you fully spec it out?

**01:09:22** What did you do? Well, there isn't really much you could do to fully spec them out these days

**01:09:26** I did go with 16 gigabytes of RAM and a terabyte of storage

**01:09:29** Okay, I think the most more I could do was just go to 2 terabytes of storage

**01:09:34** There isn't really when it comes to specking them out now. There's not much you can do

**01:09:38** I haven't looked at the configurator. So okay, you can choose 16 gigabytes of RAM or there are four storage options

**01:09:45** That's it. That's what you can do now. Oh

**01:09:47** Okay, right

**01:09:48** Well Apple's really getting in their efficiencies then with the number total number of skews that they can produce that's interesting

**01:09:54** Mm-hmm. So what like what do you think the role is for that machine for you?

**01:09:58** Like what do you where do you see it fitting in and like the ecosystem of products that you use if you remember?

**01:10:04** When I was setting up mega studio

**01:10:06** Mm-hmm. The plan was always to record

**01:10:09** From a laptop and that it would be the same laptop that I would take with me when traveling

**01:10:14** Maybe it was the original idea. Okay, that is what I expected this machine will be for but for the time being

**01:10:22** Like when I go back to the studio, it will be the machine that I use for

**01:10:28** Recording editing in theory. I do not want to record on Big Sur right now. Mm-hmm

**01:10:33** So I'm happy to actually have this time period where I will use it right as my kind of my my main

**01:10:41** Mac I want to try it for editing just because that's where the power is

**01:10:46** But I don't want to trust it to recording because as well a lot of the software that I do use for recording

**01:10:51** Has been shaky during the beta's and is now like they're like it's good, but we wouldn't even they're saying we wouldn't

**01:10:58** trust everything to this

**01:11:01** Because Big Sur changed a bunch of stuff, right?

**01:11:03** So I will use logic and so my plan right now is is I will even

**01:11:08** While at home while I want to be trying out this thing is I will record my shows using my iMac Pro

**01:11:13** But then move over to the MacBook Pro to edit them so I can see what that's all about

**01:11:19** Okay, so that's that's kind of my feeling and also I will want to try this as like my main computer

**01:11:25** Because I want to see what iOS apps on this thing

**01:11:28** We're all about right because that's what this will be able to do. It will be able to run iOS apps as well

**01:11:33** I totally forgot about that whole integration

**01:11:36** I'm really keen of like well how close to only computer can this computer be for me right now, right?

**01:11:44** If you're worried about recording on Big Sur you should get a splitter

**01:11:49** Ah and a lifter and you can record to a zoom

**01:11:54** F6 as well with more bits in the audio for you just just that's my that's my that's my pro tip to you

**01:12:01** It's good test as one audio pro to another. That's my that's my top top tip

**01:12:08** Recommendation for what you should do just make sure you get the levels right you want to have those levels leveled

**01:12:13** You think if the levels are not level there's no point

**01:12:17** So you're telling me I shouldn't update my my recording with you computer to Big Sur just yet

**01:12:23** That's they would not recommend that I'll prefer not okay

**01:12:26** You let me know when I can do that then you tell me and I may or may not wait for your recommendation

**01:12:31** But I'd still like to know when you give me the go-ahead

**01:14:14** So on our next episode I mean we'd spoken about having the next two episodes pretty much locked out

**01:14:20** We're gonna be doing our state of the apps for 2021

**01:14:24** So that's just something for people to look out for and to look forward to

**01:14:27** It's an episode that's gonna take a lot of prep work between now and then and the way that I'm gonna prep is by listening

**01:14:33** to last years

**01:14:35** You know I recommend any die-hard cortex and us to do that along with me

**01:14:39** I suppose but that's how I like to prep that way so I know exactly what I'm reflecting on from year over year

**01:14:45** But I do think we would finish out today's episode with some ask cortex questions because we haven't done some

**01:14:51** Yeah, yeah, it's been a while for it since ask cortex

**01:14:55** See what do we have in our ask cortex list here on the shared documents?

**01:14:59** Hemi asks do you strictly track your time during holiday or rest periods particularly if you're away from home?

**01:15:07** No, no, I

**01:15:10** Tend not to do that like I don't really

**01:15:14** Alright, it's like it's a slightly funny question because now reaching back into the depths of my memory of like

**01:15:20** Holidays away from home. Yes. Yeah

**01:15:28** But you are a all the time tracker right where I am just a work tracker, but you are an all the time tracker

**01:15:35** Right. So you're tracking everything

**01:15:38** Yes, I mean this this is the thing like yeah, we have this this difference here

**01:15:43** But but again like I think the key feature for me for time tracking is not that I'm it's not that I'm tracking time

**01:15:49** All the time. It's that the time tracking is much more about

**01:15:54** Mindfully using time and so if it's a holiday

**01:15:58** This is just a thing that I care way less about right like it doesn't it doesn't really matter

**01:16:03** in in the same way that like

**01:16:06** When a video goes up, you know

**01:16:08** I almost always have to take a couple days off afterwards

**01:16:11** It's just totally exhausting and it's extremely unlikely that I'm even gonna start a timer in those couple days off because it's like

**01:16:19** Who cares? It doesn't matter the like I'm just nothing nothing's happening here

**01:16:23** So so there is a limit there in in that sense

**01:16:27** You're not you don't just like because I know you have unintentional time. I think is a thing. Yeah

**01:16:33** Yes, you wouldn't just turn the unintentional timer on for three days then no because the no again

**01:16:38** I feel like you never understand the unintentional timer is very straightforward, but you feel like you don't understand it at all

**01:16:46** The unintentional timer, you know again the color of unintentionality is black it's like a black stain on you

**01:16:53** Don't want you don't want it. You say you don't have a

**01:16:57** Rest timer then. Yeah, I don't I did experiment for a little while with a timer that was just like

**01:17:05** Free time but I thought like who cares. I don't care about this

**01:17:09** This is also because I just don't tend to look back at the data

**01:17:14** The the feeling is more like

**01:17:16** You know, oh I uploaded a video yesterday. I know from long experience. I'm gonna get absolutely nothing done today

**01:17:22** I'm not even gonna try I just I just need to be like a

**01:17:27** Sloth who's not accomplishing much and so that then the whole idea of time tracking for that day just is completely irrelevant

**01:17:34** It doesn't matter. Well, you know holidays away from home. It's it's always the same thing of like

**01:17:40** Oh

**01:17:42** Visiting family it very quickly devolves into a situation where it's like yes

**01:17:46** But if I'm actually just taking some days off this doesn't this doesn't matter

**01:17:50** If I'm trying to mix like work in a holiday

**01:17:53** Then it's a slightly different thing because now I do want to be much more intentional about the time

**01:17:57** But you see that's different for me

**01:17:58** If I'm if I am away if I'm traveling even if I'm on vacation

**01:18:02** I'm doing some work or if I'm on a work trip. I stopped tracking during that time. Wait a minute

**01:18:08** Wait, you track all of your work unless you're working on vacation. That doesn't make any sense

**01:18:13** It makes perfect sense for me. How does it how don't understand but you want to you want to time track your work?

**01:18:17** Why aren't you time tracking your work because it's not normal work. Oh, it's not. Okay. You only time track normal work

**01:18:23** Yeah, like because as well like if I'm on if I'm on vacation, especially in working

**01:18:28** It is incredibly minimal like not even worth tracking it because it's like a couple of minutes here or there

**01:18:34** Okay, if I'm not in my usual environment, I do not track my time

**01:18:39** Hmm as the variables are too strong for me. What do you mean by the variables?

**01:18:44** well, like the ways in which I'm working are so

**01:18:49** Peculiar that the devices that I'm using the tools that I'm using the the reason that I'm working

**01:18:55** It's like it's it's all weird. Hmm. You know, like if I if I was on a work trip

**01:19:01** Conversations are more like work than they would normally would be but I don't track those usually

**01:19:06** There's a it's just like a completely different mindset for me. So I will just abandon it for that time period

**01:19:13** Okay, that makes sense

**01:19:15** I mean this also introduces the problem of I think I used to have this a little bit earlier when I was newer to time tracking

**01:19:22** Which I gave up very quickly is I was trying to track

**01:19:26** Travel time I thought this would be an interesting category

**01:19:29** Yeah, and and then but then you immediately run into the problem of like oh, but wait a minute travel time

**01:19:35** overlaps with a hundred other things

**01:19:39** It's like this is this is a very hard category of thing to even think about and it's just like

**01:19:44** Very quickly to totally got rid of the idea of tracking

**01:19:49** Travel time as any kind of meaningful metric. This does actually lead into another question

**01:19:54** We got from Carter who asks how do you track tasks that fall into two categories? Oh, yeah

**01:20:01** Don't don't do that is is my suggestion

**01:20:06** It's I mean look this this is you know, this is the thing of

**01:20:11** Folders versus tags, right? If you if you need something to exist in two places

**01:20:19** This this is why we have tags

**01:20:22** but the problem with tags is you have to be very careful about your tagging system and

**01:20:27** It's very easy to run into weird situations that you haven't thought about but I feel like there must be some kind of

**01:20:35** mathematical proof about information sorting that like there's only two solutions and it's called folders and tags of

**01:20:42** If you want things to exist in one place or another place, but I mean, I think my my general advice would be

**01:20:50** Just don't that there's almost always a way to just track something as

**01:20:56** The one thing that you care about more

**01:21:00** Maybe might be the way that I would put it. I would just say in most instances. Surely something is predominant

**01:21:06** Yeah, right. If you're doing two things at once surely you're doing one thing more than the other thing

**01:21:14** Yeah, yeah like you're on an airplane and you're writing a script for a video

**01:21:19** Primarily you're writing a script for a video and secondarily you're on an airplane or I think like oh

**01:21:26** I'm listening to an audiobook and I'm also exercising

**01:21:30** It's like I should get the credit for the exercise not the credit for the audiobook, right?

**01:21:35** That's that's sort of the way I think about it

**01:21:36** but again, I might not be the best person to ask for this because I just I

**01:21:42** Do not care about the record of the time tracking. I just care entirely about look at me

**01:21:49** I'm pressing a button that says I'm exercising now. So I better really exercise now

**01:21:54** That's that's how the time tracking works for me Fuzan asks if either of you added more smart devices to your home since the pandemic

**01:22:02** Started I don't know about you Mike. I find the

**01:22:06** whole

**01:22:07** Smart home thing much more frustrating than it feels like it should be yes

**01:22:12** Dude, you agree with me on this? Yeah. Yeah, and I've made it

**01:22:17** so much worse for myself in

**01:22:19** What do you mean?

**01:22:21** Have you made it so much worse for yourself? Are you familiar with home bridge?

**01:22:26** Vaguely it is a

**01:22:31** Service

**01:22:33** App

**01:22:35** Was it oh is this to get like non home kit devices to talk to home kit?

**01:22:39** Is that yes, you can run this on a server on a Raspberry Pi? Oh

**01:22:44** God, okay, and

**01:22:47** It basically is

**01:22:49** It's a community driven where a bunch of people write

**01:22:53** scripts

**01:23:01** Everywhere

**01:23:03** Home kit into seeing devices that do not natively support home kit. Oh great. This sounds like it's perfect. I

**01:23:11** Know many people that run this at home

**01:23:13** I would not run home because I don't what I don't want at home is to be dealing with

**01:23:20** Troubleshoot hang. Mm-hmm, but I am running it at the studio

**01:23:24** Okay, and it's great when it works and it's terrible when it doesn't like what kind of stuff. Do you have on this?

**01:23:31** What are you talking about? So I have a Dyson fan

**01:23:33** Okay, and I have a ring security system and also the elgato key lights for streaming like streaming lights

**01:23:41** Mmm for video

**01:23:44** Those three products I have running through home bridge

**01:23:48** So I see them in home kit at the studio before I left

**01:23:52** Before I like locked up the studio lost the home bridge stopped working and I don't know why

**01:23:58** Which is the thing I knew was going to happen, right?

**01:24:02** Because if you are doing something that you shouldn't be doing with devices

**01:24:06** Any update to any of them will kill all of it and I knew this was gonna be a case

**01:24:11** Which is why I wouldn't do it at home, but I wanted to tinker with this

**01:24:16** It just felt like a fun little project to like if I have some time I can play around with

**01:24:22** But decided that like I wouldn't buy any products with the intention that they would only be run this way

**01:24:28** You know like hmm the security system and the fan they have their own apps and I use them through the own apps as well

**01:24:35** But it's nice that I can also have them in the home app

**01:24:39** When it works and home bridge when it works is

**01:24:42** Magical right because I get to see these things in home kit and I can

**01:24:47** Set them up and use them perfectly and easily and it's great. But when it doesn't work, it's really annoying

**01:24:54** Mm-hmm

**01:24:55** I look forward to the future when all of these things will talk better together

**01:24:59** And there is like all of the main big technology companies have agreed that they will

**01:25:04** Work to communicate with each other now. I don't know if you're aware of this. It's called the connected home over IP

**01:25:13** Anything yeah, so I look forward to that future

**01:25:16** But yeah, I have added more home kit like stuff as well

**01:25:20** Like I bought like a smart switch a home kit enabled smart switch for some stuff at the studio

**01:25:26** I've been tinkering around of it a little bit more as a project

**01:25:30** But I've really wished that this stuff was just better than it is

**01:25:35** Because there's so much promise to these types of things

**01:25:38** Mm-hmm, but the idea of having to pick specific products so they work in the system you've chosen is really annoying

**01:25:44** And yeah, I just want all of these things to work together and I do hope that that is a thing that will happen

**01:25:51** Yeah, 100% the promise of the smart home is not being delivered and

**01:25:58** The flakiness is hugely frustrating of like devices appearing or disappearing on the network

**01:26:05** You know

**01:26:05** Oh lights are on the network half the time and then they're not on the network half the time and interoperability is really frustrating

**01:26:12** Just it doesn't quite count as the pandemic but just before the pandemic we had to get the boiler replaced and

**01:26:20** For totally uninteresting reasons it ended up that we needed to get a Google

**01:26:24** Nest device as the thermostat and it's like, oh god damn it. Like here's a thing

**01:26:30** It doesn't want to talk to anything else

**01:26:31** It's got its it's got its own ideas of what the temperature should be and it's like I

**01:26:36** Deeply resent this Google nest in my house

**01:26:39** That's constantly fighting with me about what the temperature should be like I just yeah just the home home automation stuff feels like

**01:26:47** it

**01:26:48** Needs a lot more time to be ironed out to not be

**01:26:52** Frustrating and to work the way it feels like it should

**01:26:58** There it is, sorry, I lost it under a little pile of cheese

**01:27:03** Where else would the mouse go? That's not even a joke. I've been I've been trying to quietly eat these baby bell cheeses

**01:27:10** Ah, I lost the mouse behind a little pile of the unwrapped baby bells

**01:27:16** You haven't even noticed clip and eating them so quietly

**01:27:20** Recording I'm really happy. I haven't heard you eat like while we're talking because that is terrible. Yeah, I've been sneaky

**01:27:29** Don't eat and record a podcast at the same time no like I'm doing right now stop it I'm gonna cut it up

**01:27:36** Right, like I'll bleep it like I'll just bleep you for like 20 seconds at a time

**01:27:41** No one wants to hear you you can put it in more text

**01:27:44** It's like extra content for more text what like you want people to pay to hear you

**01:27:49** I don't know what people want. I don't think they want that this isn't the best way to sell

**01:27:55** Longer and ad-free versions of cortex that you can get it get more text calm where we do have better content than gray

**01:28:03** Eating I can promise you

**01:28:06** I make no such promises

**01:28:08** I will promise I will promise it the content is better and more engaging and interesting the additional content that more Texans get by going

**01:28:17** To get more text calm and signing up for $5 a month. They get better content than listening to great eat

**01:28:26** There's a question here which I'll answer because it ties back right to the very beginning when you were asking me about my office

**01:28:33** Which is Justin asking my desk is a rat's nest of cables and chargers for various devices

**01:28:39** How do you keep your cables organized and presentable?

**01:28:42** And the answer is I don't and I'm sad about it cable management is so

**01:28:49** Goddamn hard to do right. Yeah, I buy all this stuff

**01:28:54** Which is supposed to do it it doesn't nothing ever works

**01:28:58** No, it never was everywhere all the time

**01:29:01** The closest I come is just make all of the wires go off the back of the desk and let me tell you when you introduce

**01:29:10** Standing desk in

**01:29:13** cable management

**01:29:15** Forget it. It's it's awful and I am genuinely

**01:29:20** Constantly sad about it like the not like even even now when I feel like I'm about as good as I can possibly be the number of wires

**01:29:27** on my desk

**01:29:29** Now is is still way too many. It's like I've got the XLR cables here

**01:29:34** I've got the cable to for the wireless charger for the phone. I've got a little cable for an LED light

**01:29:41** There's the cable for the power for the computer. It's like it's just so much. I got one of these

**01:29:47** The fantastic purchase. I got one of those little things that keeps your coffee warm

**01:29:50** That's like a heated pad to put your coffee cup on which I really like you didn't get the mug, right?

**01:29:56** No, no, not the mug thing. Okay, the mug thing I think is it is a total gimmick

**01:30:00** I just needed something where like the surface keeps warm. It's basically just a Qi charger then

**01:30:10** Yeah, it was like I got one of those but guess what?

**01:30:13** Whenever you're dealing with heat and electricity you read it need a really thick cable and so it's like okay

**01:30:18** So I've got a thick cable from this thing

**01:30:20** And then I've got also the controller that makes the standing desk go up and down and that needs a wire

**01:30:25** It's like and all of these wires need to connect to something and also have enough slack for the desk to go up and down and

**01:30:33** The real killer for me is okay. This would be solvable

**01:30:38** except for the fact that

**01:30:41** frequently enough

**01:30:43** Something changes. Yeah, and the moment you have one thing change if you've perfectly arranged all of your cables

**01:30:51** You have to start over. So the truth is under my desk in the back. There's just a there is just a

**01:30:59** horrific apocalypse of cables and I just

**01:31:04** basically leave it as it is like

**01:31:06** The closest I come is with those little velcro ties to just try to shorten up the wire

**01:31:12** But I like when I see those beautiful pictures of people in their cable management. I always feel like I wish I was a better person

**01:31:20** No work is done at those desks great

**01:31:24** Right. No, no work is done at the cable managed desks. Is that what you think? That is what I think

**01:31:29** I would like to believe that but I don't believe the cables have been managed to take the nice pictures and

**01:31:36** Then it's just disaster

**01:31:40** Okay, so you're in the same boat as me is that what you're right I try really hard

**01:31:47** But all it is is just the same amount of cables. They just have velcro ties on them now, right?

**01:31:53** I've added if anything, right?

**01:31:55** Yeah

**01:31:56** I know like one of the ways people say to do it is like you mount a

**01:32:00** Search protector to the desk and then you plug everything into that and it's like I get it and I tried doing stuff like

**01:32:06** That but then all it is is just lots of coils of cables

**01:32:10** Yeah, you know and I don't know if that's better and then yeah, I

**01:32:16** Try so hard with it and it just it never works

**01:32:20** Yeah, the the one thing I will say that I've done that is I feel like is necessary

**01:32:26** especially if you have a standing desk is

**01:32:28** I searched around on Amazon forever to find one. I found one of these

**01:32:33** super long array of plugs it was like

**01:32:38** 20 plugs in a row like one of these extension cords that's meant for like an industrial solution

**01:32:44** It's like okay. I'm gonna measure the width of the desk and I'm gonna find the longest one of these that I can so under my

**01:32:50** Desk, I've got 20 plug spaces. Now. Did you attach it to the desk? So luckily the one that I bought

**01:32:58** Had metal on the edge edges that you could use a screwdriver to

**01:33:04** Physically bolt it to the underside of the desk, right? And I did that and so I try to plug

**01:33:11** Most things into there. So it will go up and down

**01:33:15** You have to worry about something on plugging which I have had happened to me

**01:33:18** Yeah, so so that thing will go up and down and that carries a lot of the things that are plugged in

**01:33:25** But but this again is like anytime you're dealing with a real-world situation

**01:33:29** It just gets too complicated too fast because oh, I also have surge protectors and the uninterrupted power supply thing

**01:33:37** It's like yes, but only so much power can be drawn on the battery backup

**01:33:43** So that it's actually useful if the power goes out and so it's like, okay, so I can't run

**01:33:48** Everything through this and now like again the system starts to fall apart very fast

**01:33:53** I've you can't overload this one battery and it's just it's incredibly frustrating

**01:33:57** But that has helped by bolting a million plugs onto the back of the desk

**01:34:03** but again, you still run into this problem or like

**01:34:06** The XLR cable that is built into the microphone stand the the boom arm that I'm using

**01:34:13** Like but this XLR cable, I don't know why they gave me an XLR cable. It's like 20 meters long

**01:34:18** That's the built-in one right? And so now I've got just like a ton of extra wire. Where does this go?

**01:34:24** I'll just throw it over the back of the desk like all of it. So it's

**01:34:28** you I

**01:34:30** just find

**01:34:32** It's one of these things that you have to live with the trying to make this perfect is

**01:34:38** Way too much effort for not enough payoff

**01:34:43** Even though I am constantly sad and I also just don't know if it's my office, but I am every time I go under my desk

**01:34:51** Absolutely shocked at the sheer number of things that have to be plugged in like it just adds up

**01:34:59** So fast the moment you're doing anything professionally. It's like, okay. I

**01:35:05** Mean looking under my desk. It's awful right but also like what's under there. Oh, there's time machine drives under there

**01:35:12** There's a gigantic data storage machine under there like you have

**01:35:16** Additional stuff like I've got an eGPU over here, you know, it's like way too many things

**01:35:22** So anyway, I'm always I'm always sad

**01:35:25** I'm glad to know that you're in the same boat though

**01:35:28** I kind of expected that you'd have a really tidy setup over there. I tried

**01:35:34** Then you gave up really have and it I keep trying and it just doesn't it just I can't get it to work

**01:35:40** One of the bigger problems for me is like I go. All right, I'll when it's all set

**01:35:44** I'll try to redo it all but I feel like as you say like things get added

**01:35:50** Mm-hmm, and then I have to undo everything in the sorts of professional setups that we have the turnover of equipment is annoyingly high

**01:35:58** Especially if you keep buying new things hungry

**01:36:01** Keep buying new field recorders. Yeah for your XLR cable splitters for sure or you know

**01:36:07** Your podcast co-host tells you you need to get a boom arm

**01:36:09** You can't just use this standing desk and so great now

**01:36:11** I've got a 20 meter XLR cable that I didn't want to have before but here it is

**01:36:15** Well, the boom arm does have cable management built into it. What I do like

**01:36:20** Yeah, but not enough not enough on the back end

**01:36:23** But so anyway, that's the answer to your question

**01:36:26** No, no, sorry

**01:36:29** So many of you feel so much better

**01:36:31** Yeah, I can I can feel all of the superior comments and photos of cable managed situations
