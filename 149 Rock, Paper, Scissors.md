# Cortex - 149: Rock, Paper, Scissors
**00:00:00** Okay, you ready, Mike? I'm gonna hold you to the honor system right now.

**00:00:04** Are you ready? Yes. Rock, paper, scissors, and shoot. What'd you do? Scissors. Rock!

**00:00:13** This happened to me when I played against you when you told me, oh, I'm gonna go rock. But my

**00:00:20** problem was, I'd already made my mind up before you said that. And so I was like, I basically fell

**00:00:26** into the Monty Hall problem with you accidentally, which wasn't the point of the video. It's like,

**00:00:31** you can change it. I said, never will change it. And then I then faked it and then got to the

**00:00:37** second one, knocked out again, because I chose scissors again. So I only legit got to the second

**00:00:44** one. That's as far as I got legit. And then I gave up and just clicked through everything.

**00:00:49** Yeah. I mean, but that's because good old rock, nothing beats rock, Mike.

**00:00:52** So we are obviously talking about your rock, paper, scissors, video slash series of videos.

**00:01:00** Video, I feel like does not capture the totality of what has happened in my life over the past

**00:01:05** several months. Yes. I want to talk through this with you because I'm very interested. And also,

**00:01:10** cortex and I've been banging down my door wanting to know about the production of this video. So,

**00:01:16** okay, great. People want to hear about this. So I'm very interested, but I want to start at the start

**00:01:21** because every video that you have starts with a piece of information or an idea, right? That

**00:01:26** comes from somewhere. And I'm intrigued to where did this video begin? Because there's kind of two

**00:01:33** parts to it. There is the game, but there's also the odds. And so where did the rock, paper, scissors,

**00:01:38** video, like how did it first find its way into your like, Oh, I might look at this. Like what

**00:01:43** was it that triggered it? I'm not quite sure what you mean by there's the game and there's the odds.

**00:01:47** Well, there's the game of rock, paper, scissors, right? Like, but then there are also the one in

**00:01:52** a million because you didn't need to do the one in a million, right? Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**00:01:57** To be a thing, right? Like that's kind of like the two things going on in this video of like,

**00:02:02** you could have just played rock, paper, scissors against the internet, right? And it could have

**00:02:05** been like a choose your own adventure thing, which it was, but there was also this other through line

**00:02:10** of can you get to one in a million, which is like a specific thing that you kind of decided.

**00:02:16** Yeah. Well, I mean, there's also another thing, which is just talking about the game in itself,

**00:02:22** like the concept of paper, scissors, which I didn't do at all. Exactly. That's what I mean.

**00:02:25** And I wondered like, did it start with, I want to make a video about rock, paper, scissors. And

**00:02:29** then it's like, Oh, actually I can make a video playing it. We'll get into the details. This was

**00:02:34** an insanely enormous project. I think by very many metrics, this is the hardest thing that I have

**00:02:40** yet made. It was a big asteroid that crashed into my life. So there's a lot of post analysis

**00:02:47** that I want to do that I just at time of recording, haven't had a chance to do. And one of those is

**00:02:53** doing some Evernote archeology to try to figure out when is the earliest documentation that I

**00:03:00** have for starting this video. I know that it had to be at least five or six years ago, because I can

**00:03:09** date in my mind talking to some specific people at YouTube, actually, about doing something like

**00:03:14** this. Right. It was back in the day for when YouTube was doing like YouTube originals. And so

**00:03:21** there was a question of like, Oh, does this make sense as a YouTube original? And the answer was,

**00:03:25** no, it doesn't. It's like you know, someone was like, you'd heard through the grapevine. Oh,

**00:03:29** so YouTube will pay you. The more episodes you do, the more they'll pay you. And you're like,

**00:03:34** I have an idea for 1000 videos. Yeah, so my memory goes back to at least then, like,

**00:03:42** I remember having a conversation. But even at that point, I know the idea was pretty solid and

**00:03:46** had been around for a while. So we're talking like, basically, for as long as you can remember,

**00:03:51** the idea was I want to play the game with people like that. Yeah. Playing the game was the original

**00:03:57** idea. I thought that there was something fun about this notion. And it had been in my mind

**00:04:03** just because YouTube allowed this, you know, unlike basically all other video platforms,

**00:04:09** they do allow some amount of interaction, like it's not a lot. It's just a little you can choose

**00:04:16** between clicking on a couple of things and they'll take you to different videos. Importantly,

**00:04:21** on all platforms, there's some asterisks to that, but it's basically all platforms.

**00:04:24** It doesn't work well on TVs. But yes, well, like you can still click them. But it's hard. But like,

**00:04:30** you know, it works best on computers and phones, which let's be real, that's what people are

**00:04:33** watching the videos anyway. So yeah, for sure. Like on my analytics, I think it's like 60% of

**00:04:37** views now are on phones. It's at least it's over half, but it's it's a lot. Even when I hear that,

**00:04:42** it's like, yeah, that's a high number. But I'm still surprised it's not more. I think the truth

**00:04:46** is it's not more because the majority of desktop views, I am absolutely certain are coming from

**00:04:52** people who are supposed to be working on their work computers watching YouTube. That's where the

**00:04:56** other 40%. Oh, I mean, I do that right. Like everybody does that. But it's just still surprising

**00:05:01** to me. Like, honestly, like I'm surprised that like people aren't at work and they're just looking

**00:05:05** at their phones. You know, I know people do that too. But anyway, it's just that's always a surprise

**00:05:09** to me. It's like, oh, 60% is a lot. But I'm also like, yeah, but why is it not 80? I think actually

**00:05:14** the big surprise for me in the last two years is the very clear upward trend of views on TV. I

**00:05:21** think last time I looked, it's like 10% now. And it used to be under 1%. Like it used to not even

**00:05:28** show up in the analytics, but it's like YouTube is slowly gaining ground on TV. That is much higher

**00:05:34** than I expected. That's wild. Yeah. It's also very noticeable that it's on the weekend. Okay.

**00:05:40** Something about YouTube over the years has for some portion of the population

**00:05:45** become a, oh, this is what I watch on the weekend along with Netflix and whatever. I was going to

**00:05:51** say I feel like Netflix is the reason this has happened in a weird way. Yeah, it has to be.

**00:05:55** Right. Which is just like trained people to be choosing videos using their smart TV. And so now

**00:06:03** YouTube is just like shoehorned into that because people are already there. Like the kids people

**00:06:08** want Netflix on the TV. They have some kind of smart TV or some kind of thing that makes their

**00:06:14** TV smart. So then they also just watch YouTube there as well. That's fascinating. I would never

**00:06:19** have expected 10%. Yeah, I wouldn't have guessed it either. I wouldn't have even noticed if a friend

**00:06:24** hadn't pointed it out to me. I'd be like, go check out your TV view stats over the last few years.

**00:06:27** It's like, oh yeah, it's a total upward trend. Like surprising. Because it's like, I know I do it,

**00:06:33** but this just feels like one of those things that I do because I'm a nerd and I have an Apple TV.

**00:06:37** Right. Yeah. It doesn't feel like one of these things that I just assume everybody's doing.

**00:06:42** Yeah. Everyone who watches YouTube on their TV probably feels like they're the only person who

**00:06:46** does it, but actually it's becoming a significant number of people. Anyway, that stuff had just been

**00:06:50** on my mind because I was thinking about, I need to make sure where the devices are in order to

**00:06:55** still do this. And TV was the one I was thinking about of like, this just basically won't work on

**00:07:01** a TV for almost anyone. And so yeah, I just wanted to double check. Like great phones are still

**00:07:06** basically everything. Phones and computers. I'm good to go on this. But yeah, so it had been on

**00:07:13** my mind for a long time of like, what can you do with this little bit of interaction that YouTube

**00:07:20** gives you? And I think some kind of choose your own adventure thing is the obvious thought to

**00:07:28** have about this. And I mean, this gets into the math of things. There are reasons that video choose

**00:07:34** your own adventure things just don't work very well. So like I sort of ruled out straight away,

**00:07:41** like, well, you can't do an actual choose your own adventure thing. So then kind of thinking

**00:07:45** about, okay, maybe it could be a game. What options are possibilities? And then very quickly,

**00:07:50** it just narrows down to like rock, paper, scissors is the only thing I ever really considered in a

**00:07:56** serious way as like, what could you do with this interactivity? It's maybe the most interesting

**00:08:02** thing that you could simply manage. Yeah, yeah. Right. Like that people understand they get you

**00:08:08** have to explain the rules really, like it's quite simple. I guess I did just want to provide a quick

**00:08:12** piece of follow up. The cortex YouTube channel is 10% TV, which is mad. Okay, that's really crazy.

**00:08:19** Who's doing that? You know, like you do you I guess. Yeah. We're in your living room right now

**00:08:25** on the TV. That's amazing. Thanks for watching. Yeah. So you're totally right that if you start

**00:08:32** thinking through what are the options, I think almost anyone would kind of boil it down to rock,

**00:08:36** paper, scissors is the only sensible choice to do. You know, like three things to choose from

**00:08:42** is significantly more interesting than two without becoming as complicated as four. You can

**00:08:49** basically assume that it's got to be what, like 99% of the English speaking world must know the

**00:08:56** rules of rock, paper, scissors. Like there can't possibly be any other game that you could count on

**00:09:02** like a random English speaker anywhere in the world knowing. Yeah. So yeah, I was thinking

**00:09:06** about this for years, but one of the things that held me back on it was that I was originally

**00:09:12** thinking, Oh, this game could be fun, but this isn't the main thing. This would be like an addition

**00:09:22** to doing a video about the game of rock, paper, scissors. Right. And then like as a little bonus,

**00:09:28** I can do this game. I mean, I understand for like the way that you make videos, but you can't just

**00:09:33** be like, here's a thing I did. That's not the kind of creator that you are, right? Like the videos

**00:09:38** tell a story. There's something to them. I almost feel like anyone could make the rock, paper,

**00:09:43** scissors game, but the way that you did it was interesting in the way that you would do it. And

**00:09:48** I guess that's what you're going to say. Like you came to that thought. Yeah. I mean, like,

**00:09:52** I think long time viewers of my stuff will know that one of the reasons it's just takes forever

**00:10:00** for me to make things is I'm not very happy ever doing just the direct description of a thing.

**00:10:06** Like I don't like to make a video that's just like, let me tell you about this thing. Yeah.

**00:10:11** I always feel like there has to be some other element to it that makes it uniquely interesting

**00:10:18** in some way. Like sometimes it's a critical fact that I'll stumble upon. Like I've mentioned this

**00:10:22** before, like I'll be reading about a topic and I was like, yeah, no, this could be interesting. And

**00:10:27** then there's like, you find one piece of information and you go like, ah, this is what

**00:10:32** I build the whole video around. Like for me, the iconic example of this is always the tumbleweed

**00:10:38** video. It's like the fact that tumbleweed are originally from Russia, like, oh, now it's a video.

**00:10:45** Yeah. Right. This is interesting. Like all of the framing can be built around this concept,

**00:10:51** but just a video about tumbleweed talking about what they are. It's like, I just think that's kind

**00:10:56** of boring most of the time. So I'm always like looking for the other thing. And so for years and

**00:11:03** years, I didn't make a lot of progress on this rock, paper, scissors thing, because I was always

**00:11:08** kind of focused on, well, I need to make an interesting video about the game of rock, paper,

**00:11:16** scissors. And I never really found what's the interesting thing about this. That's more than

**00:11:25** just talking about the history. There's plenty of videos out there that will like, basically give you

**00:11:30** like an entertaining Wikipedia level summary of the history of rock, paper, scissors. And like,

**00:11:35** that's fine. But I was always trying to find like, but what's the additional thing? What kind of makes

**00:11:41** this interesting? The closest I ever got was just how rock, paper, scissors is related to the Pokemon

**00:11:49** system. It's kind of interesting, but the problem for me is I just never really got that into Pokemon.

**00:11:56** So I like, I'm the wrong person to try to do this. System's totally broken now, but yes, originally,

**00:12:02** it was very much like that. Now there's too many types is the problem. And so it isn't as simple as

**00:12:07** it used to be. That was like the original idea of this was like, how far can you push rock, paper,

**00:12:12** scissors before it breaks? And it's like, it works reasonably well with five. Like there's a bunch of

**00:12:17** different interesting variations of rock, paper, scissors that have five different moves. What are

**00:12:21** the other implements? Here's the thing. I was about to try to say them off the top of my head.

**00:12:25** If I just said them, it's like, I'm going to mix them up. I know some of them it's like lizard.

**00:12:29** Lizard is one of the options. Yep. Everyone knows lizards eat rocks. Yep. Okay. Okay. So the most

**00:12:35** popular variant is rock, paper, scissors, Spock lizard. Oh, and you add in this additional one

**00:12:44** and you can get a sensible five different versions of this. Now that one's been popularized

**00:12:51** by I think the big bang theory. Like there's, there's the, the actual like foundational version

**00:12:57** of it is rock, paper, scissors, water, fire. Some of these get into strange things where the throws

**00:13:04** are not equal. So it's not like there's a one third chance. Some of it breaks down where it's

**00:13:10** like you have a one ninth chance of winning throwing one thing. And it kind of adds an

**00:13:14** interesting strategic element where they're not perfectly equal. Anyway, what I am telling you

**00:13:20** right now is part of the problem of like, why did this never happen? Because the moment you start

**00:13:26** talking about those versions where there are five, but then you have to explain some of these versions

**00:13:32** that are five don't have even math. Yeah. At this point already, it's like, okay, you're just going

**00:13:38** to lose people. And why are you even telling them this? Like what purpose is this trying to serve?

**00:13:44** It's not complicated enough to be interesting in and of itself. Yeah. You know, like with a lot of

**00:13:49** my videos, the fact that it's complicated can be interesting where there's just like a deluge of

**00:13:55** stuff, like all the airport codes, right? It's like the very fact that the video, like you're

**00:14:00** 10 minutes into the video and it's like, Oh, by the way, we've only spoken about one 10th of the

**00:14:06** number of codes that exist. That's the interesting thing in the video. The complication of those

**00:14:11** videos. And I also actually feel the same for the highway ones, which is like, yes, the information,

**00:14:17** you don't need it. Like what is making this complicated is all the numbers. You don't need

**00:14:22** to remember any of these to understand what's going on here. And that's what makes it interesting

**00:14:26** where if like you were doing this video about work paper scissors, the numbers actually matter for

**00:14:30** understanding. It's the rules. It's the rules of the game and like how the game is played. And so

**00:14:34** like if they don't make sense to you, then you're not going to be able to retain the information to

**00:14:40** carry out with the video, I guess. Yeah. And then like the Pokemon thing is also like, why was this

**00:14:44** always a problem? It's like, Oh, I kind of thought the Pokemon system is interesting. It's basically

**00:14:49** even rock paper scissors, but you just keep increasing the number of Pokemon of like bug

**00:14:54** type wins against ghost type or whatever. I don't know. There are some that are easy to remember and

**00:14:59** some that aren't like, but yes. What's your favorite type of Pokemon? I would say grass

**00:15:05** because I'm a, I'm a bubble. So guy, you're a bubble. So guy, okay. What does grass defeat?

**00:15:09** Grass defeats water. Okay. What defeats grass fire? Okay. The fire defeats grass makes sense,

**00:15:15** but grass defeating water doesn't quite make sense. I feel like they only made that decision

**00:15:19** because they have the three that begin, right? So like you have a fire type of water type and

**00:15:23** a grass type. And so like fire and water were easy and fire and grass also easy,

**00:15:29** but then you need the middle piece. And so then like grass does the thing that kind of

**00:15:33** doesn't make sense, but by the end of it, you've got the three. Yeah. The game is kind of the way

**00:15:38** that the game structured at the beginning. It's important that you have the three that can defeat

**00:15:43** each other, the rock paper scissors of it all, I guess. But what you're talking about here is also

**00:15:48** like, what is the problem with trying to make an interesting video about rock paper scissors? It's

**00:15:51** like, okay, so say I'm going to skip the whole thing about, oh, there's versions of five. And I'm

**00:15:56** just going to talk about Pokemon. It's still the same problem because a huge number of people are

**00:16:03** just not going to be familiar with Pokemon. And so now you have the problem of you're trying to

**00:16:08** explain two things at once. Well, I will say just for the record, Pokemon is like the most successful

**00:16:14** intellectual property of all time. Did you know that? It's not going to defeat the point that

**00:16:18** you're making. I'm not rock paper scissors in you here, but I just, that's like a funny fact that I

**00:16:22** think maybe a lot of people don't know about Pokemon is this like how successful it is. Oh, yeah.

**00:16:27** But yes, for this video, you would have to explain it, which now we're doing a video about Pokemon.

**00:16:34** But see, like that's exactly it, right? The problem is it's really about the ratios, right?

**00:16:40** The number of people who know rock paper scissors is functionally the entire human population. Yeah.

**00:16:45** And the number of people who know Pokemon is a subset of that. You're immediately leaving behind

**00:16:52** some set of people who know rock paper scissors, but who don't know Pokemon. And now you are

**00:16:57** explaining both things. Yeah. So this is just why it's like I was toying with this for years and

**00:17:02** years and I just like never found what's the thing that for me would make a rock paper scissors video

**00:17:09** interesting to do that doesn't just cause more problems. And you're exactly right. Like you

**00:17:14** hit on it before. Fundamentally, it's a game and it means like you're explaining rules of a game.

**00:17:20** And if you're going to do that, you need to be sure that you're not introducing a new game in your

**00:17:29** explanation of another game. Like I think that's just fundamentally a problem. Like for example,

**00:17:33** take like the Ken chess with hexagons video. The difference there is like that video is immediately

**00:17:39** sorting for everyone who watches and enjoys this at least knows roughly the rules of chess.

**00:17:47** And now I'm just telling you a variation on those rules. You have the thing to compare it to,

**00:17:54** but even in that, like I'm not sure if people notice, I assume everyone who watches that video

**00:18:00** knows how to play chess, but I still take the time to just remind people what the standard

**00:18:07** motion of each of the pieces are because I think otherwise you lose people. Well, I know how to

**00:18:12** play chess, but not frequently. So like it is helpful to have a refresher in that video of the

**00:18:20** movements of some of the pieces because like I have played chess. I know how to play chess,

**00:18:24** but it's kind of like monopoly in a way for me, right? I just have a quick scan of the rules.

**00:18:30** Just so I remember like, Oh, this piece moves that all I got the two mixed up, you know, like,

**00:18:34** so it is helpful to have that. Right. Yeah. Yeah. How do I get out of jail again? I don't

**00:18:39** remember. Like I rolled doubles or sevens. Is it craps? I don't know. Yeah, exactly. So yeah,

**00:18:45** this is all like the behind the scenes stuff. Like what am I thinking about while trying to do stuff?

**00:18:48** And this is also why at this point now, basically every video I do has been in the background for

**00:18:55** a really long period of time. And this is one of these things. I'm not working on it, but I'm just

**00:19:01** trying to find the thing and you never know when you do. Now some projects just, this is the way

**00:19:08** they die that you never really find the extra thing and then you just stop thinking about it.

**00:19:14** And then you forget that you ever thought about it in the first place. And it's just like

**00:19:18** often to ghost landed goes like it did, like it never existed. But rock, paper, scissors has stuck

**00:19:24** with me for years. Cause I was like, there's something here. I just need to figure it out.

**00:19:30** I just, I can't find what the thing is. And so it was really at the very end of last year,

**00:19:39** sort of rolling over into the beginning of this year that I finally found what is the thing.

**00:19:49** And you never know where this is going to come from. And for me, the answer, it couldn't have

**00:19:57** been more unexpected. Like starting in September of last year, I had for various reasons, a bunch

**00:20:04** of existential risks just on the back of my mind. Like I was thinking about them a bunch. And that's

**00:20:10** where I was like, this is what it is. This is actually what connects to rock, paper, scissors

**00:20:16** is the extinction of the human species. Like you're dealing with this thing of numbers and like

**00:20:22** then probability and numbers getting so huge. Like what does it mean to talk about millions

**00:20:28** and billions and trillions? If you allow me to step in for a moment, because there is an important

**00:20:33** piece of context that has been missed here. I don't think it has been. People will not know

**00:20:38** what you're talking about unless they've clicked all the way through. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll get

**00:20:43** to that. Right. Okay. I just want, because like, and now we're in to existential risk,

**00:20:47** which is like for a minute, I was like, what? And they'll say, Oh yeah, the end.

**00:20:52** I forgot about the end. Like I also had a video that was sort of in the works for a long time,

**00:20:57** which was just about trying to visualize bigger and bigger numbers. That was also kind of suffering

**00:21:01** from the same problem of like, what's the interesting thing here rather than just trying

**00:21:04** to do this? Basically sometime between the end of last year and the beginning of this year,

**00:21:10** it merged into my brain that these things were all connected. Rock, paper, scissors was connected

**00:21:17** to this concept of really big numbers, which was also connected to this concept of existential risk,

**00:21:25** which is the chance of the human species being wiped out forever. And this is where I realized,

**00:21:31** Oh wow. Okay. Because of the way statistics works in this really unintuitive way,

**00:21:38** the odds of winning and the numbers of players you would need to like reach a certain number

**00:21:44** of wins gets big really fast, like much bigger, much faster than people would guess that it would.

**00:21:52** And so you can very quickly run into a case of like, how many rounds of rock, paper, scissors

**00:21:59** would you need to play before no one on earth could possibly win this game? How many rounds

**00:22:05** of rock, paper, scissors would you need to play before all of the humans who've ever lived? No

**00:22:11** one would win that many times in a row and then just extend it further. Like how many rounds of

**00:22:16** rock, paper, scissors would you need to play before no humans who might ever live would win

**00:22:23** this game. And again, because of the nature of exponential math, it's not like a bazillion rounds.

**00:22:30** It's a, I'm going to say the word manageable into like a huge quotes now. It's a manageable

**00:22:36** number of rounds. And so this is what I started to work on in the background of other projects

**00:22:42** at the beginning of the year was how can I connect these ideas together? And that's what

**00:22:51** Mike is trying to just jump to, to let viewers know that if you keep playing the game, the game

**00:22:58** is basically a fake out, right? I'm saying like, we're going to play rock, paper, scissors until

**00:23:03** you win one in a million odds. But that's not really what the video is. If you get to that one

**00:23:10** in a million point, it keeps going. And it says like, we're going to play until one in a billion,

**00:23:16** which could be someone on earth. And then from one in a billion, there's still more videos. And

**00:23:20** it goes, we can play until one in a trillion, but a trillion is such a big number that if you are

**00:23:30** taking the idea seriously, it calls into question, will someone ever be able to win this? Will someone

**00:23:41** ever honestly be able to win this many games in a row? And the answer could quite possibly be no. So

**00:23:50** that's the way all of this came together. And so what I eventually realized was the solution of how

**00:23:56** do I make my rock, paper, scissors video interesting was, oh, I don't actually need to do that part at

**00:24:02** all. I can just ditch the whole idea of making a video about the game rock, paper, scissors. I can

**00:24:09** just do the game itself because I found a way to put what I think is the interesting extra part

**00:24:17** hidden inside of this as a surprise to the really dedicated viewers.

**00:24:22** So realistically, it's about odds. And then you tie that into the fact that

**00:24:30** the world might not ever exist long enough to do the one in a trillion, even if people were

**00:24:35** like actively trying to do it. Right.

**00:24:38** I guess that's how I'd put it.

**00:24:39** I would like to especially listeners of this show sincerely recommend that people click all

**00:24:46** the way through, because I think it's kind of a travesty in a way that like it may be the best

**00:24:54** writing of yours that I have experienced is the trillion video. Oh, wow. Thank you.

**00:24:59** I clicked all the way through and I was I will say, quite surprised by it. It was very good,

**00:25:06** very emotional and beautiful. So I just think people should watch it because it's worth it.

**00:25:12** And plus, I would say it's fun. I would do it anyway. But like I did it for my work where I

**00:25:18** just clicked clicking win and I went through the whole thing and just wanted to see where it was

**00:25:23** going. I want to ask how many videos there are in total.

**00:25:26** Yeah. So if people want to get to that, yeah, Mike's right. You just need to keep clicking win.

**00:25:34** And I'm trying to remember off the top of my head, I think it's like

**00:25:38** 20 something clicks to get to the end. Again, it's sort of fewer than you would think because

**00:25:43** exponential math adds up quickly to get to a trillion clicking hundreds of times.

**00:25:49** Which is what you would think. But yeah, it's because of the way that odds work. Right. Like

**00:25:53** I actually quite like how when you start getting up to the really high numbers,

**00:25:56** you start providing context for that, too, which I thought was really helpful to help

**00:26:01** it kind of drive home the idea of just how unlikely it is that somebody could get to this

**00:26:06** point that you're using like the metaphor of the maze. Right. And just like, yeah, getting knocked

**00:26:11** out. And I thought that worked really well. I'm glad you liked the ending. Like this is

**00:26:15** a couple of episodes ago. This is partly why I was saying, I think a few things will make

**00:26:20** sense to people now. Right. Now that I could talk about like, oh, the rock, paper, scissors thing is

**00:26:24** the thing that was driving me crazy that I was working on. It's like, oh, all of the things I

**00:26:29** was talking about how why I had to be locked away in a hotel room and I was trying to keep a

**00:26:34** big project in my head. This is it. Right. This was the thing. It's like, boy, this is not the

**00:26:40** kind of thing you can work on for like a few hours a day and then go back to your normal life and

**00:26:46** come back and just be like, oh, let me pick up where I'm finished. Like, no, no, no, you've got

**00:26:49** to do this all at once or you're just never going to finish it because it's big and complicated.

**00:26:53** It's also the part where I said I was like a little bit nervous about how this would do,

**00:26:58** because in many ways it's quite earnest. And yeah, like that last video, I never really know how

**00:27:05** people take things, but I really mean that as a video. So I'm, I'm glad that you like it. I kind

**00:27:10** of know what you mean by in a sense, it's a shame that a very small number of people will ever see

**00:27:16** it, but I kind of feel like that's the point. It is a video for the dedicated people to find.

**00:27:25** The way that it feels is the way that you're writing it purposefully, right? Like it's written

**00:27:31** to the trillionth person. And so like it has this kind of feeling of a time capsule.

**00:27:38** Yeah.

**00:27:38** And so like, that's what I think makes it so effective is like, it is a message to a person

**00:27:45** who may or may not ever get there.

**00:27:46** I think, you know, this is the kind of stuff where you're sort of putting an emotional state on the

**00:27:52** line, which always feels very vulnerable as a creator. And I was really conscious of, I wanted

**00:27:58** to write that part when on that vacation where I had been just completely isolated from everyone

**00:28:06** for two weeks and was just thinking about this. So like I was kind of, I was really trying to put

**00:28:12** myself in some ways in this like mindset of isolation. And like, I'm just, there's no one

**00:28:18** that I know who is around and I'm just in this room and trying to like think forward about what

**00:28:26** this means. And having written that I had some ideas that like, Oh, I was going to revise that

**00:28:32** a bunch after I was done. But I thought, no, no, no. Like I wrote this in a little moment and I'm

**00:28:37** not going to revise this after the trip is done. Like the version that I ended up making there is

**00:28:41** like, I'm just going to stick with that even if it's not perfect. Because I think imperfect things

**00:28:46** can sometimes capture a mood better than if you do try to make it absolutely perfect. So

**00:28:52** that certainly explains the way it feels. Because it does feel different. Like it feels like it's

**00:28:59** you coming from a different like style and point of view. And so realistically, it's vulnerable,

**00:29:06** like the writing is vulnerable because you are probably in a more vulnerable state at that point.

**00:29:13** Like, oh, yeah, totally on what you were working on. And like, this is one of those things that

**00:29:18** I feel like hasn't happened in actually quite some time where I was just like very aware of

**00:29:24** the growing complexity of the project. Like, I feel like this used to be something that

**00:29:30** you would be dealing with more years ago than recently, where like, yeah, something's coming,

**00:29:37** it slips, it slips, it slips, it's just kept happening, right? Yeah. And so I'm also assuming

**00:29:44** that point you and I know you are so over it. There's some parts of this which kind of

**00:29:49** naturally bleed into our like yearly themes discussion. So I want to intentionally hold

**00:29:55** some things back. But I will just say here that in many ways, I actually feel like this project was

**00:30:01** a real kind of, for me, personal crowning work achievement, even though it just absolutely

**00:30:07** destroyed me because like you said, I don't think you have had that experience in a while of like

**00:30:13** the project slipping in the way that this did, which was much more frequent. And I feel like I

**00:30:18** have gotten so much better at managing complicated projects over the years. And what has just happened

**00:30:26** is I was able to do something that a past version of me just would never have been able to do.

**00:30:33** That is a great point. Yeah, you have two years ago, even you wouldn't have been able to do this.

**00:30:38** There's just no way you wouldn't have been able to get it done. It's too much.

**00:30:41** It's nice in careers to be able to have moments that you can point to and be like, Oh, look,

**00:30:46** I like objectively developed in some way in my work. And I think the rock, paper, scissors one

**00:30:52** is that for sure. Personal growth. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. People like to feel like there's some kind

**00:30:58** of motion and momentum, but this is just such a strange project for me because in some ways,

**00:31:05** it just ended up completely destroying all of my plans for the whole year and was ruinous,

**00:31:13** but was also like, I feel really, really happy with the way this came out. And I feel like there

**00:31:19** is no reasonable version that could have gone better than this did. And there is no younger

**00:31:26** version of me who could have possibly made this. So yeah, I'm pretty happy with the way it came out.

**00:31:32** And I'm pretty happy with kind of like getting into the right state to write that last video. And

**00:31:38** I don't know, to try to like earnestly express some ideas that had been on my mind for a while in

**00:31:45** just in a different way or in a different context. And I'm okay with the fact that a small number

**00:31:53** of people will ever see that because I think it works that if someone just shows that to you,

**00:32:01** it's in a very different context than if you click through all of the videos. Yes. I think it's an

**00:32:08** important part that, and it took a long time to make it work right, that as you keep clicking

**00:32:15** through, you have this sort of like opposite experience that you as the player keep winning.

**00:32:20** And so that's great for you. But the longer it goes on, the sadder the character of Grey is.

**00:32:28** And it's like, it's not really clear like why exactly is he sad or like these references to

**00:32:35** the future. And then I think like that last one kind of can really hit you at the right moment.

**00:32:40** And I've gotten a lot of just really great feedback from people on that. And like it does

**00:32:46** really seem like it has worked. So yeah, I mean, this is why like, I'm telling people to go watch

**00:32:50** it, but I'm not going to put a link to that video. Yeah, no, don't link it directly.

**00:32:54** Go through. It's important because it won't make sense. Like you have to see the escalation. It's

**00:33:00** an important part of then being able to contextualize why we're talking about the end of civilization

**00:33:08** at the end of a Rock Paper Scissors sequence. Yeah. This is also why when I came upon this idea,

**00:33:12** like sometimes you just know something is perfect. Because it's also just like,

**00:33:17** what an opposite ending to the start of a seemingly trivial video. Like there's almost

**00:33:23** this meta level of it. The video itself comes off as, oh, this clickbaity thing of like, oh,

**00:33:28** Rock Paper Scissors, like this internet plays the game. And then at the end, it's like,

**00:33:31** this is the most serious video I've ever made. Yeah. So step one, would you like to play a game

**00:33:36** with me? Step four, I'm worried about the extinction of the human race. Oh, okay. That's

**00:33:43** related. Yeah. And again, like the reflection of it of like the very fact that you have been

**00:33:49** experiencing odds and you're experiencing what unlikely odds feel like is the reason I am worried

**00:33:57** about these unlikely events. Like it just, everything just kind of comes together. And

**00:34:02** I'm really happy with a project does that. This episode of Cortex is brought to you by our friends

**00:36:10** I have some technical questions for you. Project this complexity, working within a

**00:36:15** system you do not control just means there's going to be a lot of weird things that go on.

**00:36:20** But I would like to know to start with how many videos are there and how long is the total runtime?

**00:36:27** Oh, okay. In the end, the number of finished videos uploaded to YouTube that are connected

**00:36:37** together is 113 videos. I phrase it like that because there were many more videos uploaded to

**00:36:45** YouTube, but things don't always work out. Like there's just, you have to re-upload things.

**00:36:48** There's glitches. The original version was probably going to be closer to 120, but at the very last

**00:36:54** minute I was like, a couple of these I just have to cut out because I just can't. I have to get

**00:36:59** the things finished. So the final version has 113 videos. And I am so glad that I did not know

**00:37:08** this until after it was finished, but the runtime of all of those videos is one hour and 33 minutes

**00:37:16** in total. It's quite a lot. Again, if I had known this at the start, I would never have started.

**00:37:21** So I'm very glad that I did not, but yeah. Why is that? Like about the runtime, like it seems like

**00:37:26** the amount of videos isn't the problem, but it's the length of them.

**00:37:29** It's more just like I was completely shocked by the runtime is the way that I would put it. Like,

**00:37:34** I always knew the number of videos. The number of videos was the thing that I was thinking about.

**00:37:40** That runtime is a bit of an overestimate, right? Like probably the real speaking runtime is

**00:37:45** something closer to an hour because by the nature of it, like every one of these videos has 10

**00:37:49** seconds where nothing happens. My favorite part is one of the videos where you're like,

**00:37:53** we just have to sit and wait, which is really good. This one's meant to happen quickly,

**00:37:59** but like we just need to wait a minute. And now we can finish that. I just like that.

**00:38:05** That was me expressing my frustration with the YouTube system of like YouTube, please.

**00:38:11** Why do you have these arbitrary restrictions about how short the video can be before end cards are?

**00:38:15** Why do you only let me put them in the last 20 seconds? My whole life would be so much easier

**00:38:21** if you would just let me put them in a video of any length at any time, but no. So yeah,

**00:38:26** that was me being like a little passive aggressive towards YouTube.

**00:38:29** I mean, at the point where you put the YouTube robot thing that you've created in there,

**00:38:33** I'm not sure if it was passive anymore. You're like explicitly calling them out, but

**00:38:38** YouTube, you know, we've got like a complicated relationship. I love that you allowed this whole

**00:38:42** thing to exist in the first place, but also it's incredibly frustrating to work through your system.

**00:38:46** Was it one script in the end that you were working from?

**00:38:50** No. So that's why it's like I had no idea how long the actual runtime would be. So the way,

**00:38:55** like on my back end, it's basically 113 individual scripts. Like I always see what the word count is

**00:39:02** of whatever I'm working on. And so I know roughly like, oh yeah, like 2000 words is going to be this

**00:39:06** long. But I just in the process of making it had never seen it. And so it wasn't until someone,

**00:39:14** when I was doing the director's commentary, someone pointed out that I could like

**00:39:17** select all the files and final cut and see the total runtime. And yeah,

**00:39:21** it was just genuinely shocking, but I was also kind of relieving in a way because

**00:39:28** it made me feel less like, how did I get so overwhelmed with this? And it's like, oh,

**00:39:34** the answer is you uploaded like three years worth of stuff. Like that's how this got so

**00:39:40** overwhelming. Whereas when they were the individual videos, I think in my head,

**00:39:45** I could kind of round all of them down to zero in some sense. It's like, oh, none of these videos

**00:39:50** individually is any kind of big deal. So if I round them all down to zero and then sum it up,

**00:39:56** it's like, it's not a lot of work. It's only when you see it all together at once that it was,

**00:40:01** it was really shocking. Like, oh, I actually did end up writing a ton for this. And this also

**00:40:06** explains why the audio took weeks to do to get all of the different parts of it right.

**00:40:14** I think much to the chagrin of my animator, I refuse to like copy paste the things where

**00:40:21** I'm saying like rock, paper, scissors, or paper beats rock. It's like, no, no, I want

**00:40:25** all of these to be unique. I don't want any of these to be repeated. There's one little section

**00:40:31** like depending on which path you take through the maze where I'm, I've copy and pasted a description

**00:40:36** of what has happened because the same thing has happened in each place. But even on those videos,

**00:40:41** they're not exactly the same because I wanted it to sound different when I say like rock beats

**00:40:46** paper or, you know, whatever thing I'm saying at the end. These are the little details. Like,

**00:40:51** I don't know if listeners really pick up on that, but to me it was important that it didn't feel to

**00:40:57** the person like, Oh, I just copy pasted the same audio 300 times. It's like, no, no, I want to

**00:41:03** actually say these different. There are some videos I'm assuming that are written in such a way that

**00:41:10** someone will and could see them multiple times, right? Through one playthrough. No, there's no

**00:41:15** video that someone's seen multiple times through a playthrough. There's no repeated videos. If you

**00:41:20** are doing an honest playthrough once, there are no repeated videos, even on the like going backwards

**00:41:28** part. Yeah. Even on the going backwards part. Wow. Commitment to the craft, man. Jeez,

**00:41:34** you did not need to do that, but I appreciate that you did. People tried to talk me out of this,

**00:41:40** but I felt like this was important to do. Yeah. I'm all in on the idea of making it as artsy

**00:41:45** projects as you can possibly make it. Like if anyone, I'm going to be all in on that.

**00:41:50** The reason I thought is just because some of them have no context in them and they're fast. So I

**00:41:56** just assumed that they were made so you could see them more than once and wouldn't remember that.

**00:42:02** So hats off to you. I can send you the map of the whole thing. Well, I was going to ask,

**00:42:08** how were they linked? Like, how did you work that out? The linkage? What were you using to?

**00:42:16** So that's half of it. Oh my word. Let me squeeze something together so I can try to get like one

**00:42:22** shot for the show notes. Are you effectively using an obsidian canvas here? Yes. I am quite

**00:42:27** effectively using an obsidian canvas. And I'm assuming that these are all going to obsidian

**00:42:32** notes then, right? Yeah. So each one of these is an obsidian note. What a great use of that

**00:42:38** feature. Look, I'm just going to say it. I think this is the biggest public project that has ever

**00:42:45** been done with obsidian. Like it just has to be. What other thing made on the internet has been

**00:42:54** seen by as many people that required as complicated and obsidian set up as this. Yeah. I think I met

**00:43:01** the peak. I think there is no one on earth who has done something that hits both of those at the

**00:43:07** same level of like maximum viewership and also maximum complicatedness for an obsidian project.

**00:43:15** So yes, what I have sent Mike is some images of how did I put this project together? How did I

**00:43:24** keep everything straight? And what I did is in obsidian, there's a feature called canvas.

**00:43:31** Basically, you can take any of your individual notes in obsidian and drop them onto the canvas

**00:43:38** where they just become a little box and you can connect them with lines to other boxes.

**00:43:45** And this is how I built up the map for how should the game work. So

**00:43:53** listeners, you will just have to pause your podcast player and take a look at the show notes

**00:43:57** to have any concept of what I'm talking about here. But in the image that you're going to look at,

**00:44:03** each little square represents one of the videos in the screenshots where I've zoomed in close

**00:44:11** enough so you can see the individual squares. You can see that the script for each video exists in

**00:44:18** one of those squares. So I can kind of get an overview of like at least the starting part of

**00:44:23** each script that I'm working with. And then I connected each square representing a script,

**00:44:32** representing a video with red, green, or white lines sort of depending on what's happening

**00:44:39** for what other videos should this video connect to via the end cards. So that is what Mike is

**00:44:48** looking at right now is a big complicated mess of squares broken up into a bunch of different

**00:44:54** sections connected with lines and the red and green lines represent the win or fail state and

**00:45:01** where the viewer should go. This is incredible. I kind of can't believe that it does work.

**00:45:08** It seems so complicated, but like did this allow you to effectively plan out

**00:45:15** how they were going to be linked when uploaded? Yes, it didn't start out this complicated, right?

**00:45:21** Even when I say like, Oh, I got the idea of what I want to do. I'm going to have this rock, paper,

**00:45:25** scissors game that's going to end with the possible extinction of the human race. Great.

**00:45:29** Very simple. It's like one line, it's going to be 20 games, just a straight thing. And we're done.

**00:45:36** And so I was thinking like, okay, I need to just have some way to look at this. I don't want to

**00:45:41** write this all out in a single script. I do want to take advantage of like breaking things down

**00:45:46** into individual notes because it's nicer to work with stuff that way. And so like, let me just

**00:45:50** throw this on a canvas and start to think about it. Because I need a little bit of like what

**00:45:54** happens when the person loses kind of stuff. So I started to think about it. But then the moment I

**00:46:00** started drawing this out, it made much clearer where there were problems in the potential flow

**00:46:08** of how players would travel around. It also made it much more obvious where things just weren't

**00:46:15** going to be fun. And so you're looking at the end result of trying to solve a bunch of problems.

**00:46:23** One of those problems is, well, if I'm playing rock, paper, scissors, people are going to lose.

**00:46:31** Like basically the definition of this game is every honest player will lose eventually.

**00:46:38** Some people might make it to one in a million, but we can easily round that off to zero percent of

**00:46:45** the viewers will win. Well, that's kind of a bummer, isn't it? Like that's no fun. Let's play

**00:46:52** a game. All of you are going to lose. Oh, right. I don't like that at all. So what I tried to do

**00:47:00** was slowly increase the number of ways that someone could have more chances. So this is

**00:47:08** where depending on how people went through the maze, it's a bit like if you fail, I repeatedly

**00:47:14** try to give you multiple chances to get on a winning streak. And so on the map that you're

**00:47:21** looking at, there's three vertical lines in the center. Those are three main paths that can be

**00:47:28** winning streaks for a player. They're like these columns. Yes, those columns. So the leftmost

**00:47:35** column at the top, that is the one video that is public, the one that has a yellow line that's

**00:47:40** connected to it. That's the start. And if you just keep winning, you're going down that vertical

**00:47:48** column. That is like you are winning the first game. It's the golden path. Yeah. The yellow line

**00:47:53** is just there for me to mark off that the final ending video where I have like a general message

**00:47:58** to everyone who has played that also connects back to the very first video. So that's why that like

**00:48:04** there's that one color that's different. I'm just talking about there's a bunch of boxes that are in

**00:48:09** a blue rectangle. That is if you keep winning every time you're continuing down this first path

**00:48:17** for a one in a million victory, but you can be knocked off that path. But then you, I will,

**00:48:24** if you win after you get knocked off, direct you to the start of a second chance to try to win a

**00:48:31** one in a million. And then if you get knocked off that second chance, I will try again to redirect

**00:48:37** you to a third chance to win one in a million before you are actually knocked off. So the player

**00:48:45** doesn't know this at the start, but they really have three chances to try to win one in a million

**00:48:51** and that will only become clear to them when they lose the first round. Yep. Does that make sense?

**00:48:57** It makes sense. And so those three chances to win one in a million, those all then direct you to the

**00:49:05** one in a billion and one in a trillion run. Yeah. So if you get to the end of any of those three,

**00:49:10** you'll get directed onto there. And then across the top is something else that I added halfway

**00:49:19** through, which like doubled the complexity of what I was doing when I realized like, wait a minute,

**00:49:28** if someone keeps losing, like if they lose every time, that actually also starts becoming very

**00:49:36** unlikely. And so I realized, oh, I can do what I called an anti-luck run where instead of winning

**00:49:44** to one in a million odds, you can not win until one in a million odds. So you draw or lose every

**00:49:52** single time. And I often decide like I'm doing a project, I found the thing, this is interesting.

**00:49:59** And then it is a professional delight when I find like, oh, there's something else that's even more

**00:50:06** interesting in here that I just didn't even conceive of when I started the project. And this

**00:50:12** concept of like someone is anti-lucky and they never win, but they never win so many times. It's

**00:50:20** one in a million. I was like, oh, this is delightful. Now, of course, fast forward to where this was an

**00:50:26** absolute complete nightmare to make and the worst part of the project because it's just too many

**00:50:30** videos. And I was like cursing the fact that I had ever thought of this concept of anti-luck. But yeah,

**00:50:36** so that's what the top of this is trying to show is all of those videos where you lose or fail

**00:50:43** every single time and you get through the entire game without ever winning

**00:50:47** and end up as a one in a million anti-lucky winner. How did you ensure the linking in the

**00:50:54** YouTube system? Like this map is great, but like this is not how YouTube looks like. How did you

**00:51:00** correctly assign the linkages to make sure that it was done correctly? Yeah, so this was a severely

**00:51:09** not fun part of the project. After everything's recorded, after all of the videos are made,

**00:51:16** after everything is exported and we've gone through the different versions,

**00:51:20** it all needed to get uploaded to YouTube. And there's no way around it. This was just pure

**00:51:24** misery. This was an absolutely miserable time in my life putting all of these videos up.

**00:51:31** So the thing that I worked out to answer your basic question is that I developed a code to name

**00:51:39** all of the videos uniquely with a little bit of information that tells me where in this map does

**00:51:48** this exist. So again, on those screenshots, you can see that the videos all have names like

**00:51:54** R1H03W. And so that means to me, it's like Run 1, this is the first game where you could win one

**00:52:02** in a million. It's Hand 3, and then W means this is the video for the win state. So it's like, oh,

**00:52:10** R1H3L is like Round 1, Hand 3, but the losing state. So all the videos had unique names.

**00:52:20** I duplicated all of those names in Final Cut so that when I exported these videos,

**00:52:27** the file name would be the same unique name as the script. Uploaded them to YouTube. We will

**00:52:35** shortcut the unbelievable amount of work it took to just even get them uploaded to YouTube.

**00:52:40** But once they were there, I could then use the naming system to be able to find which two end

**00:52:48** cards need to match up with this video. So that's how that worked. And if someone is clicking

**00:52:54** through on the videos now, those file names are still in the descriptions of all of the videos

**00:53:00** as just a way for me to have a record of like, which script was this? Which video was this?

**00:53:05** Because when I was done, I didn't want them to have these titles because I think it would just

**00:53:09** be distracting to people and they would be trying to guess. So I went back and then renamed all of

**00:53:15** them just with like a red or a orange emoji for the win state or the losing state. On the YouTube

**00:53:21** backend, I now have pages and pages of videos that have no names. They just have red and orange dots

**00:53:29** on the YouTube backend. So that's how it worked. The answer is a unique code for each script.

**00:53:34** Use that to refer to the map, to put the end cards correctly so that each video is

**00:53:41** linked to where I have it in this map in Obsidian. This episode of Cortex is brought to you by FitBud.

**00:55:48** of cortex and Relay FM. Are your analytics ruined forever? I guess it's also a separate question

**00:55:58** because I saw a lot of people talking about this. How do you feel like the algorithm feels about you?

**00:56:03** Oh, the algorithm obviously does not like this video. Okay. It's another reason why like this

**00:56:09** project was just a lot of work. It was also kind of crushing to work on because I was just constantly

**00:56:15** worried about this is not what the algorithm wants. The YouTube algorithm does not want the

**00:56:22** thing where a YouTube channel that uploads like four to six videos in a year suddenly uploads

**00:56:30** more than a hundred, all of which are unlisted except for one extremely short video at the

**00:56:36** beginning. Like none of this is going to fit into whatever machine learning system has been devised

**00:56:42** to figure out like what is happening here. It was just interesting to see, but like, you know,

**00:56:49** YouTube provides you with all of this information about impressions and I could see just straight

**00:56:55** away and I can still see it that YouTube is just not interested in showing this video to people.

**00:57:03** Like it's so clear. The impressions data is the worst thing in a very long time that I have

**00:57:10** uploaded. And I can't say that I'm surprised by that. It does create this really weird phenomenon

**00:57:17** though where again, like people will ask, why am I so happy with this video? And like one of the

**00:57:22** reasons is the amount of positive feedback I have gotten from people is just incredible. It's like

**00:57:30** an order of magnitude more positive feedback than any project in a long time I can think of.

**00:57:38** Because people who like this love this. But I also know that there's a huge number of people

**00:57:47** who bounce off of this just immediately. So I do just want to signpost here. Like

**00:57:52** my feeling is not even, oh, the algorithm should have promoted this more. I think that there's very

**00:57:58** many ways in which the algorithm may be totally correct in not showing this to more people,

**00:58:04** because just like the hexagon chess video, that was a video where I knew talking to people,

**00:58:11** oh, people either love this or they just don't care at all. And the rock, paper, scissors one,

**00:58:16** I could tell it was the same thing. They would either have a very strong positive reaction,

**00:58:20** like, oh wow, that sounds really interesting. Or it would get a reaction that was a bit like,

**00:58:25** so what, why am I playing a game of rock, paper, scissors against you on the computer? You're not

**00:58:30** even here. Like what are we even talking about? So to answer the question, the analytics exist in this

**00:58:37** amazing place. They are in some sense, the worst a video has done in a long time.

**00:58:45** And it's also kind of the best a video has done because roughly speaking, every view on average

**00:58:54** that is generated on the first video translates to about 10 views in total from people clicking

**00:59:02** through. So as of right now, this is a 14, 15 million view video project.

**00:59:15** Right. So there's the video is one thing, but the project. Yeah. So like, you know,

**00:59:21** I was going to ask you, do you think this video was a success? But I guess the question is,

**00:59:25** was this project a success? And those are maybe two different things with wildly different outcomes.

**00:59:31** That's the exact way to talk about this. In some sense, I could like totally make the argument of

**00:59:37** like, Oh, that rock, paper, scissors video, total failure, like just very bad, not being recommended

**00:59:44** by the algorithm. It's gaining no new audience. It's also why like the number of comments I've

**00:59:50** gotten from people who are like, I never even got recommended this by YouTube. Also like order of

**00:59:55** magnitude, more of those comments than I normally get from people. I was like, I'm not surprised.

**01:00:00** So I could easily make the argument of like, Oh, that rock, paper, scissors video,

**01:00:04** what a disappointment. But at the same time, this may be the most viewed thing in aggregate

**01:00:12** that I ever make. Like if that 10 to one ratio holds, and if the first video crosses more than

**01:00:22** 3 million views, eventually it will be the most viewed thing I've ever made. It'll be the most

**01:00:29** in total popular thing on the channel. Now, like, does it entirely make sense to think about it that

**01:00:34** way? I can easily argue like, no, that's sort of a dumb way to think about it. But that sound is

**01:00:39** exactly right. I view this project as a huge success for these two things. What I was hoping

**01:00:47** would happen is happening. That 10 number is really just an average, right? What's actually happening

**01:00:55** is probably more than half of viewers are clicking once or none. And then a smaller percentage of

**01:01:04** viewers are having a freaking blast, like exploring the maze behind the scenes. And like,

**01:01:11** that was the thing I'm like, I'm just really hoping like, are there enough people who just

**01:01:17** really enjoy going through something like this? It's like, I know I would enjoy going through

**01:01:22** something like this, so I hope other people are. And that has totally happened. So again,

**01:01:28** I'm sort of going to talk about this in themes, but like, this has been by far one of the weirdest

**01:01:32** years of my life. It's got to be the weirdest project I will ever do. Like, I just, I can't

**01:01:38** conceive that if I work on YouTube for another 10 years, that I will ever do anything as weird as

**01:01:44** this again, because it's just such an insane outlier. It's kind of hard to know exactly how

**01:01:52** to think about this, but I can definitely tell you, like my YouTube backend is not easy to work

**01:01:58** with anymore at the very least. Like I'm really used to being able to like scroll down that one

**01:02:04** page and see videos from the past several years. And now it's like, Oh, no, no, no, dude, before

**01:02:11** you did this, you had like 200 videos in total ever uploaded to the channel. And you increased

**01:02:19** that by 113 in the space of two weeks. So it's like, no, this is brutal. You know, you're saying

**01:02:25** about this being like maybe the weirdest thing, like I always say this too, but this is one of

**01:02:28** those times where people in my life, like kind of like our mutual friends are like, what is he doing?

**01:02:36** You know, like when people see it, it's like, wait, what? I'm like, yeah, man,

**01:02:41** it is what it is. He's done it. He's gone and done it. You know, you're saying about the

**01:02:47** recommendation. When you told me about this video, I was so excited about it, right? And I was

**01:02:52** convinced it was going to be a success because it's weird and people will like it. And I thought that

**01:02:58** it would get some element of word of mouth, like that it felt like a perfect word of mouth video.

**01:03:03** And like, I saw it, you know, like in a bunch of blogs that I follow were posting about it. And,

**01:03:08** you know, on like various social channels and stuff. And like in the relay for members discord,

**01:03:14** everyone was having a great time when the video came out, right? Like it had that kind of feeling

**01:03:18** to it. Oh, great. But the thing that I was worried about for you, the fracturing of the social media

**01:03:24** landscape that exists today, felt like it did the video with disservice. Like if this video came out

**01:03:33** in 2021 or something, and like all of the potential audiences still using Twitter the way that they

**01:03:41** were, I think that this video would have maybe had a not massively but a different trajectory.

**01:03:47** Yeah, I mean, maybe I'm not sure about the impact of this. Yeah, I don't think really any creator is

**01:03:53** like now that the social followings have kind of fractured a little bit and conversations aren't

**01:03:59** like in one place as they were. Like I just wonder if it may have gone a little bit differently if

**01:04:05** there was more of a focal point around where people were spending their time online. I'll just say for

**01:04:10** now, I have some thoughts around that that I kind of want to save for the theme episodes. But yeah,

**01:04:16** like there is something to that. Okay. Ultimately, there's no way we can know this, but it's just a

**01:04:22** gut feeling that I have. Right. And this is something that I think at some point, it means

**01:04:26** if we don't end up talking about it in themes, I don't know what's coming up that I would maybe

**01:04:30** want to touch on at some point of like how social media for a content creator now is so different,

**01:04:37** just like structurally. I'll say this as a preview. I think you are right. But I disagree

**01:04:44** with you on the reason. We'll leave that for next time. Yes. Next time, which is themes,

**01:04:48** by the way, in case people are wondering, we moved episodes around this year. I was seeing some

**01:04:54** people like, Oh, stay at the apps. That means themes is next. And I'm like, no, it doesn't.

**01:05:00** No, thanks to our content calendar, we have actually planned ahead to not have two

**01:05:05** absolutely backbreaking episodes right next to each other. We have instead Gray talks about his

**01:05:12** completely life destroying project in the middle of the two biggest episodes.

**01:05:16** But isn't that better though? Because like our, we were really brushing up against the start of

**01:05:23** state of the apps when you were finishing this. Yeah. Which was like a worry. Like we had to

**01:05:27** keep moving it. And I'm like, Oh, it is the most listened to episode of the year. And it takes

**01:05:33** maybe the most preparation. I feel like I am just constantly causing my stress and problems and a

**01:05:40** bunch of different ways. Like this is one of them, but this was also like, I think you could sense

**01:05:47** that there was something different from me because as I was trying to close down this project,

**01:05:52** just like when I was creating the map while I was on the graycation, it's like I had to keep all of

**01:05:57** this in my head. The moment I started putting this stuff up on YouTube, I was extremely aware of,

**01:06:05** I cannot stop. I have to, now that I have begun, roll through and do just this all at once,

**01:06:16** because the moment I take a break from it and try to come back, it's like I will have dropped these

**01:06:22** hundred plates that I'm trying to carry from one place to another. So this is why I was like,

**01:06:27** we do need to move things back. And this is not an option because if I take a break from this,

**01:06:33** I will have to start over from the beginning. And yeah, it was that that was part of what made it

**01:06:40** really brutal. There was one thing I don't remember what it was, but it was if I needed something from

**01:06:46** you. I don't remember. I think it might have been the edit, something to do with the edit. I don't

**01:06:50** remember. But I remember feeling frustrated that we weren't moving it forward. And there was a moment

**01:06:57** where I was like, I know this feeling. I have not had this feeling for a really long time.

**01:07:04** And then I was like, it kind of clicked for me of like, this one's different.

**01:07:12** I knew the project. I didn't understand the scale of the project. I feel like, honestly,

**01:07:18** until I saw that map, you know, like you kind of need to see that to understand how big it was.

**01:07:23** But yeah, like you are not constantly causing me problems. You used to constantly cause me problems,

**01:07:30** but you don't anymore. Oh, good. I'm glad to hear I've improved. But like this one,

**01:07:34** it just had a different feeling in its scope and size. Yeah. What you said there is also why,

**01:07:41** like I'm very happy for you to put this like behind the scenes stuff in the show notes,

**01:07:44** because I think even the people who have clicked around, it's difficult to understand

**01:07:49** the scope of the project until you see a map of it. Also, one of the other things that was just

**01:07:57** absolutely delightful from my perspective and was a real confirmation of how people were really

**01:08:04** just loving it is the number of people who made their own versions of this map was just crazy high.

**01:08:13** The number of people I saw either manually trying to draw it out, right? People who were making

**01:08:19** maps of like, where does this click over here? There were so many different versions of that.

**01:08:23** My absolute favorite one was someone who just took a ton of pieces of paper and by hand with

**01:08:31** pencil tried to draw out the entire thing. Oh my God. They did the always sunny meme.

**01:08:38** Yeah. Yeah. They were that person. Again, whenever you make anything and you put it on the internet,

**01:08:42** you're always kind of vulnerable to this. Like how are people going to react? And this one in

**01:08:46** particular, I was really hoping like, I just want some portion of the audience to absolutely love it.

**01:08:55** And that was the confirmation for me of seeing like people are spending hours and hours

**01:09:01** building a custom website to try to list out like what are all of the videos and you can click on

**01:09:05** any of them to see the different things. So like drawing by hand and rearranging on paper,

**01:09:10** where do all of these videos connect to each other? That to me was just the ultimate confirmation

**01:09:15** of people just love this. Some of those people will know I was removing some of those from the

**01:09:21** subreddit, but just on the very first few days. It's like, I don't want spoilers. And this was

**01:09:26** basically like the ultimate spoiler. So those are getting approved now, but anyone who made one of

**01:09:32** those things, like I did take them off the first few days and I was trying to send messages to

**01:09:37** people like, Hey, I totally love that you did this. I just want to try to keep spoilers off

**01:09:43** for a little bit. I've got to assume people understand that everyone was on board with that.

**01:09:47** Like I did just feel kind of bad because it's like, Oh, this is such an outpouring of enthusiasm.

**01:09:52** But also like, you know, again, like I'm trying to give people a certain kind of

**01:09:56** feeling with this and the fun is the exploration. And so if you just see the map, it kind of pops

**01:10:05** that fun instantly. Yes. Cause you shouldn't know how big it is. Yeah. That's the whole thing.

**01:10:12** You shouldn't know that there's a whole second run. Like you shouldn't know these things. Oh,

**01:10:18** by the way, I guess spoiler alert, if you haven't done it, but like, I feel like if you're this far

**01:10:24** into the episode, you've at least paused the podcast and gone and watched the video. Right?

**01:10:29** Like I'm just going to have to naturally make that assumption about the listener.

**01:10:33** I mean, you know, look, we always find the outliers, but I feel like surely almost everyone

**01:10:38** who's listening to this podcast has played the game. Well, I mean, even if they hadn't

**01:10:44** at least 20 minutes into this episode, they're like, you know what? I should probably go watch

**01:10:47** this video. So I know what they're talking about. I now look forward to the comments of the people

**01:10:53** who said they didn't do that. But tip of the hat to those people, because I do this, right? Like

**01:12:58** getmoretechs.com. I want to talk about audience, right? Because I assume that there's a bunch of

**01:13:06** things going on here too. So obviously spoilers, you wanted to try and avoid those as much as

**01:13:12** possible. Did you do any like pruning of the comments? I actually didn't need to do as much

**01:13:18** of that as I thought. Like there was- You'd locked them to start, right? I think was the-

**01:13:23** Yeah, yeah. Which was the right call, I think. I don't think this really affected people,

**01:13:27** but I was so annoyed because there used to be an option on YouTube to hide the view count of a

**01:13:35** video. And I wanted to have all of the secret videos have no view count because I thought that

**01:13:45** is a different kind of experience for the viewer to just to not know how many other people have

**01:13:53** seen this thing. And it's like that used to be a thing you could do. I don't know when they took

**01:13:57** it away. But I think in my head, I always thought it was there because I knew there's the option to

**01:14:03** close the comments. And what's also now like basically ridiculous is the option to hide the

**01:14:10** like number, which is like what an appendix of an option now that they've gotten rid of the dislike

**01:14:15** button. Hashtag never forget. Like I can't conceive of why anyone would want to do that.

**01:14:19** It's like I want to keep the views, but I got to hide the likes. I don't want people to think

**01:14:23** that anyone liked this video. It's totally bizarre. But I think because I saw those two options there,

**01:14:29** because the hide the like is incredibly dumb now, like I was photoshopping in the hide view count

**01:14:36** option, which used to be there, but they got rid of it. And I only discovered that I'd done a bunch

**01:14:41** of tests to make sure all of this could work beforehand. But I hadn't tested hide the view

**01:14:47** count. I mean, look, this is one of these things where it is probably best that I didn't discover

**01:14:53** that during the testing phase, because I actually would have rewritten a bunch of the videos knowing

**01:14:58** that that was the case and instantly doubled the workload. So I didn't realize until everything was

**01:15:05** exporting. I was so frustrated at that point in time. But it was like, whatever, I just have to

**01:15:12** deal with this. Because I guess what you're saying is if you would have known that you would have

**01:15:16** maybe written things in the idea of knowing that people know that there are people that are actually

**01:15:22** doing the run through who are not being honest, which is obvious. Yes, exactly. Like I would have

**01:15:27** written it in a way that sort of acknowledges what's happening with the view count, but whatever,

**01:15:31** like it's not going to rework 113 videos. So again, I'm kind of glad I didn't discover earlier

**01:15:39** in the process. But yeah, so one of the other things I was really worried about is spoilers.

**01:15:44** So that's why like the comments are just hidden on a ton of these videos, because

**01:15:49** logistically, it's just impossible to try to keep track and make sure no one is spoiling what the

**01:15:54** correct answer is at each step. So it's like there's comments on the first video. And then

**01:16:00** there's comments on all of the endings, except for one, I did turn off comments on that final

**01:16:09** video where I talk about the end of the human race. And I know that people are frustrated with that,

**01:16:16** because people are like, oh, like I got to the end, like I want to leave a comment, I want to talk

**01:16:20** about it. But this is me being the RD creator, right? It's like, no, no, I want to force you

**01:16:28** to just sit with that thought for a little bit and have nowhere to express it. This again is kind

**01:16:35** of the thing, I think when people watch something, there's a way they can pop their own bubble of

**01:16:41** thoughts by just immediately reading the comments and then leaving a comment themselves. It's like,

**01:16:47** no, no, no, just for that final ending, the important video I've turned off the comments,

**01:16:52** because I want you to just have to think what you think about that without being able to just

**01:17:01** read everybody's take on existential threats and humanity. So yeah, so there's comments enabled in

**01:17:08** different spots. It's mostly like having comments for a big part of the run would have ruined it.

**01:17:16** I had to worry about spoilers. And also, I think telling people now that like,

**01:17:20** I was planning that no one would even know the view counts also explains why it's like I was

**01:17:27** going to have no comments, no views. I guess this is the only case actually, I'm suddenly realizing

**01:17:33** where I actually would have wanted to click the no likes button because I would want to hide that

**01:17:37** too. So you'd have no information. So yeah, in case people you leave breadcrumbs, you know,

**01:17:42** they've been here. I wish I could have been abused. This is you don't get to control it,

**01:17:52** right? They do whatever they want. Yeah, you got you got to work with the system,

**01:17:55** but the system still let me make this crazy thing. This episode of Cortex is brought to you by

**01:19:00** super simple for them to connect their accounts. And they had a very clean and clear view of all

**01:19:04** of the services that they were subscribed to. It was incredibly easy for them to cancel what they

**01:19:09** didn't want to be paying for. It was as simple as tapping some buttons in the app and rocket money

**01:19:14** took care of all of those cancellations for them. This feels like magic, but also the way that things

**01:19:19** should be done and rocket money takes care of it for you. Now they're paying less. It's a no-brainer.

**01:19:48** show and relay a fan. Something that I saw in a bunch of places that was very confusing to me

**01:19:54** to why people were reacting this way was the question of what do I do if I draw when it was

**01:20:02** so obvious like to me like this is maybe one of those things where like if it's obvious to you,

**01:20:09** you don't know why people don't understand it. Yeah, that's exactly what's happening. It was on

**01:20:13** the screen. You would show the hand movements. When was this a lose was the other two and I guess

**01:20:21** in a perfect world you'd have three end cards so you could have draw right. But then that's probably

**01:20:25** good because you would have done an extra branch of what if you draw for one in a million you draw

**01:20:30** every round. So I am actually happy that they don't have three end cards because it would have

**01:20:35** added even more work onto your plate. First, I mean just conceptually playing a thing. It's sort

**01:20:41** of easier for the player to just have two options, but I was aware and I did know I am going to cause

**01:20:48** confusion with some number of people over this issue of the draw. It is also why I'm not surprised

**01:20:57** that the algorithm is just giving this video far fewer impressions than other videos because I do

**01:21:04** expect that that kind of confusion is something that like the algorithm can basically derive from

**01:21:11** the viewers of like what's happening here, right? Maybe people are just taking a longer time before

**01:21:16** they go on to the next video or like whatever it is, but I fully expect that like the algorithm

**01:21:21** actually can pull out some kind of concept like user confusion at location. So I just like I just

**01:21:28** knew that I was going to take a hit on I can't give people three options. I'm going to need to

**01:21:35** compress it down to two and I'll just I'm going to take that hit. But mathematically the reason why

**01:21:42** is because if you think about it for a second, the problem is with the statistics here that

**01:21:48** if a player draws well in rock paper scissors you go again and see then who wins or who loses.

**01:21:56** But you can draw a second time, right? Like just like you said you can keep drawing a bunch

**01:22:02** and the answer to if you are going to try to resolve the draw, how many videos do you need

**01:22:10** to do that? The answer is literally an infinite number of videos. It is not possible to guarantee

**01:22:19** you can resolve a draw in a finite number of steps. And so that's why it's like well this isn't even a

**01:22:27** thing I get to make a decision about. It's literally impossible within the YouTube system

**01:22:33** of you can only link to pre-made videos to successfully resolve draws. So I just I just

**01:22:40** had to be like okay draws are going to count as losses and I did that because it just makes the

**01:22:45** game shorter than if you count draws as wins. But in my first version I actually was writing it as

**01:22:50** draws or wins but I realized it made the project significantly larger and it was just too big so I

**01:22:56** changed it so that draws or losses. Like what it felt like to me was and hey look if you're one

**01:23:02** of these people I'm sorry if I'm putting you in a bucket. It felt like to me people were reacting

**01:23:07** to a thing before they'd paid attention to it. I mean maybe I have a lot of sympathy here for

**01:23:11** two reasons. One of which is just in the video itself I never explicitly say draws count as losses.

**01:23:19** Right? What I actually did is this is one of these things that just happens when you're writing a

**01:23:24** script right. There are some points in the script where you spend a lot of time trying to select

**01:23:30** exact phrasing. Yeah. But those places are not at all obvious to the viewer. There's no reason that

**01:23:36** they should be. Yeah. That's a good point. So my language around the concept of fail is extremely

**01:23:42** careful because I'm trying to be inclusive of loss and draw are both failures to win. So I spent a

**01:23:51** lot of time on that but the viewer doesn't know that right. That's a line that just goes by real

**01:23:56** fast. So I never explicitly say draws are fails. That's partly my fault. Like I had longer versions

**01:24:04** where I was explaining stuff more and I basically made the decision of like this is too boring. I

**01:24:10** really wanted to get that first video under three minutes. In an ideal world I would have gotten it

**01:24:15** under two but that was just compressing it too much. So draws count as fail is part of the thing. So

**01:24:22** right there since I have not verbally said it I immediately give a huge pass to a large number

**01:24:29** of people for being confused at the end. And then secondly it is a very hard earned lesson

**01:24:36** from being a teacher that no matter how clear you think instructions are they could always be clearer.

**01:24:45** And I don't think I did an amazingly clear job of explaining the concept that draws are failures

**01:24:51** in the end. Okay. I will take back on my criticism of people. Like it was clear to me but it is fair

**01:24:57** to say like it's not necessarily something is clear to everyone. Yeah. But here's the thing like

**01:25:00** I also feel like no but it is very clear right. The thing to me that is funny that you could miss

**01:25:07** something and then you go to like a social media like you have to write it or something to say

**01:25:12** like what do I do. It's like you've spent so much energy to go and do the other thing. Like it's the

**01:25:19** answer is there. But hey you know I can't understand everyone. That was kind of sad but also expected.

**01:25:26** And again that's also why I was like oh there's a bunch of things that are just working against

**01:25:30** this video and that is one of them. But let me Mike let me tell you what is my real heartbreaker

**01:25:35** about this video. Right. Just that like I go oh I never would have expected it. I could not

**01:25:42** have predicted it in a million years but it just kills me. What ended up being the most work and

**01:25:52** the hardest part of this video is what I mentioned before doing this anti-lucky streak. What happens

**01:25:59** if you keep failing. And there were some points where I was seriously considering cutting that

**01:26:04** whole part but I thought no no no no like this is interesting. You got to do it man. Like sometimes

**01:26:09** stuff is just hard and you need to push through. And I'm really pleased with the way it came out.

**01:26:14** And it makes me want to cry how many people had the experience of they lost and they just stopped.

**01:26:25** They didn't click the lose button. Yes. And I was like oh right because it's like guys no no no you

**01:26:32** don't understand. I've given you so many chances. Right. Like there's a whole world to be explored

**01:26:39** here. You just have to click the button. But people were like oh I never would think to do that.

**01:26:47** Like I got comments where people like oh I lost so it was just over. It's like no click the lose

**01:26:53** button. Like dude I'm here for you. Right. I've I've made so many interesting things for you.

**01:27:00** We have a whole maze to explore but you don't know if you just haven't clicked the like what

**01:27:07** happened button. So keep in mind rock paper scissors. There's three things that can happen.

**01:27:15** Two thirds of the people who watch that first video should click the fail button. Yeah. And I'm

**01:27:23** I think maybe half of them just stopped because they thought the game was over and they had just

**01:27:31** lost. And that to me was the sound of my heart breaking into a thousand pieces. But like I guess

**01:27:38** this is one of those things where like you just can't know. You just can't know. But like people

**01:27:42** are so different because like to me I'm like I want to see what this video is because like I know

**01:27:48** there's another video there. Right. And so like I'm just interested in like what's he gonna tell me.

**01:27:54** You know. But I see the thinking. I would never have assumed it but I see the thinking of well

**01:28:00** it's over. Right. But it's not over. There's so much more.
