# Cortex - 120: Episode Out of Time: Rio Heist
**00:00:00** It's an episode out of time.

**00:00:01** Yeah, it is an episode out of time.

**00:00:03** If you're new to Cortex, what it means is we recorded this episode in advance,

**00:00:09** much more in advance than we usually do.

**00:00:11** We'll get into why later on, but what that means is things get a bit weird.

**00:00:16** It's what happens, because there's especially where we are right now,

**00:00:20** there's like stuff coming up, and this episode will be released

**00:00:24** either after or during those things, and it would make sense

**00:00:27** that we would talk about them on the show, but we can't because we needed to record

**00:00:31** this one a couple of weeks earlier than usual.

**00:00:34** Yeah, episode out of time to me is defined by the future past tense of speaking.

**00:00:40** Yeah, right. We will have.

**00:00:42** All right. That's what that's what an episode out of time is.

**00:00:45** We will have had done this thing.

**00:00:48** Well, here we go, then if you want to get into this,

**00:00:53** we will have had an incredible poster made for this episode.

**00:00:58** Yeah, well, maybe.

**00:01:00** So it's actually the imperfect future past tense.

**00:01:02** Maybe we will have had an incredible poster made.

**00:01:05** We don't know because the poster will have to relate to the contents of the show,

**00:01:10** which as we're recording, we have no idea what that's going to be.

**00:01:14** And if the poster will come out well, incredible artists,

**00:01:17** C.D. Roland, who I've used before for my podcast posters.

**00:01:21** Yeah, he's working.

**00:01:22** We'll be working have worked on this art for us,

**00:01:27** but cannot start for another three days from today.

**00:01:31** So we have no idea what it's going to be like.

**00:01:34** But I expect it's going to be great.

**00:01:37** The poster is going to be an awesome real heist.

**00:01:40** I'm looking forward to seeing it.

**00:01:41** And it is one of these funny things of like, oh, yes,

**00:01:45** we will be trying this out and seeing if we can make a fun poster for the episode.

**00:01:49** And we don't know.

**00:01:51** Although, of course, if you're hearing this now, future us has decided

**00:01:55** to keep this part in, so there definitely is a link.

**00:01:57** But if you're hearing this, it has happened or will happen.

**00:02:00** Or it will happen.

**00:02:01** If it doesn't happen, this won't be in the show.

**00:02:03** And if you are still hearing this, it's because you're spying on us in some creepy way.

**00:02:08** Yeah, that's episode out of time.

**00:02:10** Real heist.

**00:02:15** So why are we doing this?

**00:02:16** Why have we created this terrible time paradox for us?

**00:02:19** I think it's mostly my fault, but also you are very willing to go along with it.

**00:02:25** Yeah, this is one of those classic gray has a problem.

**00:02:28** Mike is very happy with the solution.

**00:02:30** Yeah.

**00:02:30** So you are in the world of podcast-a-thon planning.

**00:02:35** That's that's what your life looks like right now.

**00:02:37** Oh, there's there's like, I mean, needy podcast-a-thon planning with an at the time

**00:02:42** of recording imminent announcement of an iPhone event.

**00:02:46** Right.

**00:02:47** Which looks most likely to me right now to be occurring in the week of the podcast-a-thon.

**00:02:53** Perfect timing.

**00:02:54** Is it?

**00:02:55** It feels like a tough time.

**00:02:57** It's a rough, tough time for me.

**00:02:59** But hey, we're going to make it work and it will help content for the podcast-a-thon anyway,

**00:03:03** because we'll have iPhones to talk about.

**00:03:04** But we in the coming days, I'm going to start breaking down my studio to start setting up the

**00:03:12** gazebo again, the balloon room and also setting up kind of a new and improved video

**00:03:18** recording set up for this year's podcast-a-thon.

**00:03:21** So that that's kind of what I've got on my radar right now.

**00:03:24** What's new and improved?

**00:03:25** What are you doing?

**00:03:26** I have better lighting and better cameras and stuff like that than last year, just which is

**00:03:31** basically all stuff that I've amassed over the last year of doing Twitch streaming and stuff.

**00:03:35** Ah, OK.

**00:03:36** I'm able to repurpose all the gear that I've been like using to make my Twitch streams better

**00:03:41** into this.

**00:03:42** And I've got my big fast gaming PC, which is going to help big time.

**00:03:45** I'm in a better kind of like equipment space than I was last year, because plus, if you

**00:03:50** remember, trying to buy lights in July and August of 2020 or cameras was really hard.

**00:03:58** Oh, right.

**00:03:58** Yes, of course.

**00:03:59** Because everyone was buying them for their home working Zoom situation.

**00:04:03** There were no extension cords to be found anywhere.

**00:04:05** It was so difficult.

**00:04:06** So I had significantly overpaid just for a Logitech webcam because I needed one.

**00:04:11** So all of that stuff, it's a bit easier to procure this time and get everything set up.

**00:04:16** And I've been kind of like adding to my knowledge of how to do good video streaming or halfway

**00:04:21** good video streaming stuff over the last year.

**00:04:23** So I think I should be in a much better position.

**00:04:26** I got a ring light.

**00:04:27** Oh, wow.

**00:04:28** You're a real beauty vlogger now, Mike.

**00:04:30** I know.

**00:04:30** It's going to be amazing.

**00:04:31** I look forward to seeing that ring of light in your eyes.

**00:04:34** I know.

**00:04:35** It's going to be beautiful.

**00:04:36** I get some real Zooms going on.

**00:04:38** Yeah.

**00:04:38** So we're we got a lot going on the podcast.

**00:04:41** I thought in case you don't know what that is, it is an eight hour stream that we're going

**00:04:46** to be doing to raise money for St.

**00:04:47** Jude's Children's Research Hospital.

**00:04:49** We'll talk about that a little later on in the episode, but the podcast itself is going

**00:04:52** to be occurring on the 17th of September from 12 to 8 p.m.

**00:04:59** Eastern time.

**00:05:00** We got a lot going on there and so twitch.tv.

**00:05:02** So really FM.

**00:05:03** So I'm setting up for that.

**00:05:04** And just in general right now, my schedule is bananas.

**00:05:08** We're doing a bunch of like extra streams and stuff as we hit fundraising goals

**00:05:12** throughout the campaign.

**00:05:14** So I'm doing one basically as soon as we finish recording today, which I'm sure is

**00:05:19** going to go great.

**00:05:20** You've got a long day ahead of you.

**00:05:21** I feel rough for you after, you know, doing a Cortex episode and then going right into

**00:05:26** a live stream.

**00:05:26** I couldn't I couldn't do it.

**00:05:28** You're a real hero.

**00:05:29** I actually feel like I'm a little horse today.

**00:05:31** Like I feel like I can hear it in my voice a little bit.

**00:05:34** This is just a busy time.

**00:05:36** There's definitely been some better like planning this year because we would usually

**00:05:41** be coming straight off of our member specials in August.

**00:05:44** Right.

**00:05:45** So this is one of the reasons we moved those earlier.

**00:05:47** And I will tell you right now, I am feeling the benefit of that.

**00:05:50** Yeah.

**00:05:51** The only way that this month could be worse is if you move the member episodes into

**00:05:55** September.

**00:05:55** If you said, oh, we're going to do member episodes.

**00:05:57** Some of them work.

**00:05:58** Because they take, you know, some of them would take a while to make.

**00:06:00** I was definitely doing some in September in previous years.

**00:06:03** So.

**00:06:03** Yeah.

**00:06:04** Yeah.

**00:06:04** So we spaced things out a bit, but as is very normal, we gave ourselves more space

**00:06:09** and then put more stuff in.

**00:06:10** So, you know, that is always what happens.

**00:06:13** We just got a lot going on.

**00:06:15** September is Mike's busy season.

**00:06:17** So I think that that's part of the reason when I suggested to you, Hey, can we

**00:06:22** record as early in the month as we possibly can?

**00:06:26** You were, you were very on board with that.

**00:06:28** Oh yeah.

**00:06:29** Cause this is at the moment, this is me at my best.

**00:06:33** You're getting me at my best, even though it's not as good as normal.

**00:06:36** This is the, you're getting me at the best I can give you.

**00:06:41** Oh, thank you, Mike.

**00:06:43** Appreciate that.

**00:06:44** But there was an inciting event though, right?

**00:06:46** Like you, you're doing something.

**00:06:48** Yeah.

**00:06:49** My inciting event is that I am finally going to be traveling internationally.

**00:06:55** And so I view this as the end of my horrible summer swamp of uncertainty that

**00:07:02** has been really miserable for the past several months of playing this game of

**00:07:07** trying to delay travel or like time travel to be in between COVID waves.

**00:07:14** Time travel.

**00:07:16** If you can time travel around COVID, my friend, I would appreciate it.

**00:07:23** Really lean in into the lore of this episode.

**00:07:25** I would say, great time travel.

**00:07:28** I have no idea.

**00:07:30** I was just talking and you say weird words sometimes.

**00:07:34** That's so good.

**00:07:35** I was trying to time the travel between COVID waves, but whatever.

**00:07:40** See now we're leaning into the creation of the poster now.

**00:07:43** Right.

**00:07:43** Okay.

**00:07:43** This is how that works.

**00:07:44** Okay.

**00:07:45** So time travel can be a theme of fantastic.

**00:07:50** But yeah, so like I said, what, what feels like a lifetime ago, I think maybe the last

**00:07:56** themed episode, I was like, I will not let this year go without seeing my family.

**00:08:01** Like I just refuse.

**00:08:02** So this is part of what's, what's ending up happening is I'm going to travel to see

**00:08:07** some friends with a thing that we've arranged.

**00:08:09** Took us months and months to try to arrange.

**00:08:12** And then after that going to America and I'm going to see my family and very

**00:08:17** quickly that ends up just taking a, an entire, like the last three weeks of the

**00:08:22** month up.

**00:08:23** And I was like, sure.

**00:08:25** I can theoretically podcast from the road, but I would just really rather not if

**00:08:31** there's any way that we can do it in the first week.

**00:08:34** Uh, and so that that's why I was like, I know, I know normally we would do it later,

**00:08:37** but I don't want to be trying to set up a podcast little studio at my parents'

**00:08:42** house if I don't absolutely have to.

**00:08:43** We've done it before many times, but not for a long time.

**00:08:46** Yeah.

**00:08:46** And also plus this is one of those cases where especially now I'd rather not take

**00:08:52** an afternoon out while I'm with my parents for a cortex recording.

**00:08:56** If it doesn't really need to happen since I haven't seen them in so long at this

**00:09:02** point in time, I would feel pretty guilty requesting that you take time away from

**00:09:07** your family during that.

**00:09:09** Like I would feel pretty rough if I, come on, I really need to record the show.

**00:09:16** Yeah.

**00:09:16** So I wouldn't feel good about that.

**00:09:18** Yeah.

**00:09:18** So it worked out for both of us that were able to record it, but it does make it a

**00:09:22** bit weird because you have all of the biggest events in your whole year, which we

**00:09:27** would normally talk about.

**00:09:28** I'm going to be releasing a video very soon and it's like, Oh, we would normally

**00:09:32** talk about that, but it's not like it hasn't actually happened yet.

**00:09:35** So it's our episode out of time, which I feel like we do just about every year.

**00:09:39** This is at least one.

**00:09:40** So it was around this time of year, summer of gray, you know, this is how it goes.

**00:09:45** Uh, how are you feeling about making the big trip to America?

**00:09:51** Um, I'm a little uncertain.

**00:09:54** Uh, I've definitely have had this feeling of I don't have any idea what even to pack

**00:09:59** anymore.

**00:10:00** Yeah.

**00:10:01** I'm going to be trying to do a gear minimum version of this trip, which is also why I

**00:10:05** didn't want to record a podcast on the road if I didn't have to.

**00:10:08** But yeah, I think, I guess maybe the way it feels is I think I used to be a lot more

**00:10:17** anxious about travel.

**00:10:19** Years and years ago.

**00:10:21** And then as the amount of travel in my life increased, I got less anxious about it and

**00:10:25** it became more of a routine sort of thing.

**00:10:29** And I think now I'm, I'm feeling like I did years ago with just the uncertainty of

**00:10:35** everything, especially with all of the COVID restrictions.

**00:10:38** Like it could very well be that all of this gets canceled if a COVID test goes wrong.

**00:10:43** And I feel like I hate that kind of stuff.

**00:10:46** Yeah.

**00:10:46** That there is a little swab that decides whether all this is happening or not.

**00:10:51** And the outcome of that swab at any point during the many times you need to take one

**00:10:56** could change everything.

**00:10:58** Yeah.

**00:10:58** I think I, I, according to the current plan, I need to do three COVID swabs or four

**00:11:06** before I can have the full green light to see my parents with the way the travel's

**00:11:10** working out.

**00:11:11** And I just hate that.

**00:11:12** I really hate the uncertainty of that.

**00:11:13** It's rough.

**00:11:14** I haven't done the first test yet.

**00:11:15** I think I'm, I think I'm doing it in a couple of days, but yes, I feel like this

**00:11:19** has brought back in all of this feeling of uncertainty around travel that I just

**00:11:23** don't like.

**00:11:24** So I felt this, I felt this too.

**00:11:27** So we, we spoke a little bit in the last More Techs episode about the fact that I

**00:11:32** had taken a trip to see some family in Bucharest and the way that you're

**00:11:36** explaining this now too, it's, it's kind of hit on a thing for me.

**00:11:39** Now, you know, me and you were business travelers, right?

**00:11:41** We would travel many times a year for business, right?

**00:11:45** And in doing that, you establish rhythms and you become comfortable with it.

**00:11:51** I think what COVID has done, I expect for many people who are in similar situations

**00:11:55** to us is knock away all of the benefit.

**00:11:59** Like I remember what it was like when I used to travel before I traveled

**00:12:02** regularly and how like I was uncertain about everything.

**00:12:06** I was nervous about everything.

**00:12:07** I didn't know how it was going to go.

**00:12:09** What papers do I need to bring?

**00:12:10** I'm back in that what COVID has done.

**00:12:13** The amount of time it's been since we traveled frequently and we've just

**00:12:16** added uncertainty has basically removed all of the benefit that I'd

**00:12:21** gained for being a frequent traveler.

**00:12:23** Yes.

**00:12:23** Yeah.

**00:12:24** 100%.

**00:12:25** And I'm now back to where I was in 2014 or whatever.

**00:12:30** Yeah.

**00:12:30** Like, like I've had this anxiety about this stuff is, is so in the UK, you need

**00:12:36** to get this international pass for proving that you've been vaccinated.

**00:12:41** And I have spent three weeks attempting to get this pass in time of like, oh,

**00:12:48** you can order it and they'll send one to your house and it doesn't, or you can

**00:12:51** try to verify it through your phone and you can get a copy, but the

**00:12:54** verification doesn't work.

**00:12:55** And so I've, I've had this like slowly increasing level of anxiety of, oh,

**00:13:01** I'm doing this three weeks in advance.

**00:13:03** So I've got plenty of time to get this, this one like Soviet style travel

**00:13:08** document that I need to leave the country.

**00:13:11** Papers, please.

**00:13:12** Yes, exactly.

**00:13:13** I'm like, oh great.

**00:13:13** I've got plenty of time.

**00:13:15** And it's like, oh, a week later it hasn't arrived.

**00:13:16** Okay.

**00:13:17** Well I'll submit it again.

**00:13:18** A week later it hasn't arrived.

**00:13:19** Okay.

**00:13:19** I'm going to try to do it this other way.

**00:13:21** And as I've mentioned before on the show, there is some problem with my particular

**00:13:25** NHS records that constantly flags up these weird issues.

**00:13:29** And so I was trying to do everything just purely electronically and getting

**00:13:33** these bizarre messages where they're like, Oh, you don't seem to be registered

**00:13:36** with the NHS.

**00:13:37** I was like, Oh my God, please just give me this piece of paper so I can travel.

**00:13:43** I actually just got it yesterday, but I was literally minutes away from

**00:13:50** resorting to begging on Twitter.

**00:13:52** Like, is there anyone in my followers?

**00:13:54** Oh boy, it got bad.

**00:13:56** That's what you know, it got really bad.

**00:13:59** But I was like, I am very close to, to doing this, to be like, does anyone on

**00:14:05** Twitter work at the NHS technical support to like fix whatever this problem

**00:14:10** is so that I can fly out in three days?

**00:14:13** Like I've spent three weeks trying to get this stupid piece of paper and

**00:14:17** I've just run into all of these.

**00:14:19** Like that to me is really what travel used to feel like.

**00:14:23** Everything is this one-off.

**00:14:25** You don't know how it's going to go.

**00:14:27** And also with travel, it's like, it's why you get to the airport way early because

**00:14:32** you never know what the variance and delays are going to be like.

**00:14:36** And this is what this felt like of like, Oh great.

**00:14:38** I started three weeks ahead of time.

**00:14:39** I thought I had more than enough time and I actually made it with three days

**00:14:44** despair, which is way too close for comfort to get this piece of paper.

**00:14:48** Like I agree with all of the reasons for having this documentation, right?

**00:14:53** Like I think proof of vaccination for travel, I think makes a lot of sense.

**00:14:58** And it can help make things easier for you on the other side, right?

**00:15:01** But it doesn't take away the fact that it is an increasingly, an

**00:15:07** incredibly complicated procedure.

**00:15:09** Yeah.

**00:15:09** And when it doesn't work right, then what are you going to do?

**00:15:12** Right?

**00:15:13** Yeah.

**00:15:13** And you know, the other level of anxiety is, you know, so I'm going to Europe

**00:15:17** first before I'm then traveling straight to America and just trying to work the

**00:15:21** logistics of getting a COVID test in time to be able to take the flights.

**00:15:27** And it's like, Oh, I'm in a slightly remote area.

**00:15:29** So this is difficult.

**00:15:30** It's, it's, you know, it's, it's all very anxiety producing.

**00:15:35** So I cannot say that I am loving getting ready for travel.

**00:15:40** Yeah.

**00:15:41** I still not sure why you're doing this on like medium to hard mode.

**00:15:44** You know, like I know that there's things you want to do, but stacking trips

**00:15:48** together just seems like you're making things way harder for yourself.

**00:15:51** I know that I am, but it's, there's two things here.

**00:15:54** One of which is stacking trips together allows me to go to America sooner.

**00:15:59** So that's something I would like to do.

**00:16:00** Fair enough.

**00:16:01** The other thing is I just want to try to minimize time at airports.

**00:16:04** So that's my main thing.

**00:16:07** It all seems fair.

**00:16:08** I mean, I get, I get it, but it's still like, it's harder.

**00:16:12** It is harder.

**00:16:13** Um, I'm not, again, I'm not that worried about being on the actual plane.

**00:16:17** That's not my primary source of concerns, but just think if I can just spend less

**00:16:20** time at the airport, that would be fantastic.

**00:16:24** But this is also where I, you know, I don't know what odds to give it, but.

**00:16:30** I don't know.

**00:16:30** I would say, I would say there's like maybe a 50 50 chance that I have to come back to

**00:16:36** the UK anyway, before going back to America.

**00:16:39** I don't know.

**00:16:40** So like we'll, we'll have to see, but that's exactly the kind of stuff you

**00:16:43** just don't want with travel, travel.

**00:16:45** I want it nice and certain.

**00:16:47** So you don't have to worry.

**00:16:48** That's, that's where I currently am.

**00:16:50** I will feel much better when I get four, three or four green lights from COVID

**00:16:55** tests and I'm able to fly to America.

**00:16:59** Good luck.

**00:17:01** Thank you.

**00:17:04** I feel like I'm going to need it.

**00:17:06** This episode of Cortex is brought to you by SetApp.

**00:17:09** Getting things done.

**00:17:10** It's a challenge that we all struggle with.

**00:17:12** One way to tackle it is to make sure that you have the right tools for you and your

**00:17:16** computer, and this means having the right apps.

**00:17:18** This is something that every Cortex listener can understand.

**00:17:22** SetApp is on a mission to help users get more done.

**00:17:25** With SetApp, there's no more worrying about having to search for apps to solve a

**00:17:28** problem because SetApp packs over 200 apps for your Mac and your iPhone into one.

**00:17:35** That's an app for almost any tasks.

**00:17:37** So you can stay in your flow and finish what you started.

**00:17:39** So you can think about your tasks, not having to search the whole

**00:17:42** internet to find certain apps.

**00:17:44** What I love about SetApp is that it includes, it is a bundle of a bunch of

**00:17:49** your very favorite applications.

**00:17:51** Some of mine like Bartender, Timing, MineNode, and CleanShotX, they're all

**00:17:57** available with a SetApp subscription.

**00:17:59** So you can go in, they categorize everything really easily, and you can just

**00:18:03** choose what apps you want to download and you have access to them.

**00:18:06** And apps that have companions for iOS, you get access for those as well.

**00:18:10** It really is a fantastic value and it's also incredibly convenient as well.

**00:18:14** Instead of paying for hundreds or even thousands of dollars for separate

**00:18:18** licenses for applications, there's just one flat monthly fee.

**00:18:21** New apps are added to SetApp regularly.

**00:18:24** Updates are free and they're all the full featured pro versions of those applications.

**00:18:33** Go to SetApp.com and you can try SetApp out for free for a week.

**00:18:37** If you like it, it's just $9.99 a month and you get access to those

**00:18:41** hundreds of applications.

**00:18:43** That's SetApp.com.

**00:18:46** SetApp.com.

**00:18:47** A thanks to SetApp for the support of this show and really FM.

**00:18:51** Thinking Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman.

**00:18:54** Let's do it again.

**00:18:55** Come on, let's do it again.

**00:18:56** I want to do it again.

**00:18:57** Oh yeah.

**00:18:58** You want to have that conversation?

**00:18:59** I want to do over.

**00:19:01** We really worked ourselves up in that conversation.

**00:19:04** That was a funny one to listen back to in the editing bay.

**00:19:07** We got upset, huh?

**00:19:09** Yeah, I was really surprised at how worked up I got during the show.

**00:19:11** We were, I mean, the thing was we were riling each other up because we both

**00:19:15** hit upon things that we didn't like about the book and then finding somebody

**00:19:19** else to complain about.

**00:19:20** We were just like, we were whipped up into a storm.

**00:19:24** With one of those things where, you know, you always say this and I, and I get it

**00:19:27** sometimes, but this was definitely an episode where I'm listening back and I'm

**00:19:29** like, I'd love another go on that because I could feel my point in some of the

**00:19:34** stuff that I was trying to say, but I know I didn't get it across just right.

**00:19:38** But not in such a way that honestly, I feel like it's necessary for me to

**00:19:42** clarify now I'm happy with the episode, but there are just points where it's

**00:19:46** like when you hear yourself say it, I wish that everybody that was going to hear

**00:19:51** me say this thing, I could see their faces when I said it.

**00:19:53** Right.

**00:19:54** Right.

**00:19:54** So I could gauge if my point had been understood and that's just the risk that

**00:19:59** you make when you create things for people to hear.

**00:20:03** Yeah.

**00:20:03** Well, and also I think it's very clear that we also sound riled up, right?

**00:20:07** Like, like you could just hear the riling up increasing.

**00:20:10** And so I do think that helps in people's listening.

**00:20:13** It was just very funny.

**00:20:14** Like I didn't realize how annoyed I was at the book until we started talking to

**00:20:17** each other and they were like, rah, this is terrible.

**00:20:21** But one thing I do just want to say at first, I feel like there was just a

**00:20:24** fantastic discussion in the Reddit about that episode.

**00:20:27** I feel like it was a really great discussion on all parts.

**00:20:30** I greatly valued it.

**00:20:31** Yeah.

**00:20:31** Yeah.

**00:20:31** It was very interesting to read.

**00:20:33** I think it was also just a great case where people clearly disagreed with each

**00:20:38** other, but everyone was being civil about it and it's like, Oh, you know, but this,

**00:20:43** we're arguing it from this side or from that side.

**00:20:45** So I really enjoyed the conversation in the Reddit from that last episode.

**00:20:48** I greatly value when somebody can disagree with me and I can be frustrated

**00:20:54** that they disagreed with me, but know that they're right.

**00:20:56** Yeah.

**00:20:57** You know, like, is this like, no, you didn't, you didn't understand this

**00:21:00** point correctly or like, I understand that you're upset, but you have

**00:21:04** misunderstood the fundamental issue of what he was trying to get across.

**00:21:06** And it's like, I'm still annoyed at what I've read, like in the book, and I'm

**00:21:11** annoyed that someone has been able to show me where I'm wrong, but I appreciate

**00:21:15** it because I can understand it, you know, and it's cause there was like a lot of

**00:21:18** people were saying like, well, some of the stuff I was getting the most upset

**00:21:21** about was exact examples of what kind of I'm just trying to point out.

**00:21:25** My system one was making me mad and that was the point.

**00:21:29** And I still stand by the fact of like, okay, I understand that, but I don't

**00:21:33** think he explained himself very well.

**00:21:35** And so, you know, I get, this was the kind of conversation that was

**00:21:38** going on in the subreddit.

**00:21:39** I know that we both really enjoyed it.

**00:21:40** And I loved how many people you got to introduce the replication crisis.

**00:21:46** I have had people like in my life tell me about that, like that they first heard

**00:21:50** about it on the show, like in this last episode and it's freaking them out.

**00:21:52** Oh yeah.

**00:21:53** Yeah.

**00:21:53** Yeah.

**00:21:53** Yeah.

**00:21:54** Me and my wife, we didn't had a great discussion about it because I was telling

**00:21:58** her about it on the night we were recording and not doing a very good job of

**00:22:01** explaining the point and she was like, man, I don't know what you're talking about.

**00:22:05** And then when she heard the episode, she was like, Oh yeah, no, this sounds terrible.

**00:22:10** You know, cause she was in the camp of like, no, there's no way.

**00:22:14** There's no way.

**00:22:14** What?

**00:22:14** Like, what does she mean by there's no way?

**00:22:16** As in like, there's no way that journals would publish stuff that wasn't

**00:22:20** thoroughly researched, you know, just because our brains, I think like to believe that

**00:22:26** there's just no way that would happen.

**00:22:27** Yeah.

**00:22:28** I think there's, um, I don't know how to express this in a way.

**00:22:33** I can, I think I said this in the last episode.

**00:22:36** I'm very cautious about.

**00:22:39** You don't want to encourage people to become cynical about everything.

**00:22:43** I think a cynical and reflexive disbelieving in things is worse than a

**00:22:50** credulous believing in everything.

**00:22:52** Like, I think there's a way in which that can be much worse.

**00:22:54** And sometimes when you talk about these things, it's very easy to give the

**00:22:58** impression that everything published is totally wrong.

**00:23:01** And that's, you know, that's not what I'm saying here, but I say that as

**00:23:04** preface to the sentence where partly because of replication crisis and partly

**00:23:09** because of the work that I do on videos and things, I want to kind of express

**00:23:13** this idea very delicately that things like books and journals for me have

**00:23:20** totally lost a certain shine that they used to have when I was younger.

**00:23:26** Or you'd be like, Oh, this book, it's full of knowledge.

**00:23:31** And now my feeling is a lot more like, Oh, this book, it was written by a person,

**00:23:36** you know, like a person, all these books were written by a person.

**00:23:40** And it's not like the book is this thing that has knowledge.

**00:23:43** Like, no, no, like a person wrote this book.

**00:23:45** I know people who write books and I just look at it very differently in this way.

**00:23:49** That's a little bit hard to articulate.

**00:23:51** And that also translates to these papers and journals that get published.

**00:23:55** It's like, yes, it's a scientist who's publishing this or a social scientist

**00:24:00** who's publishing this, but they're a person, right?

**00:24:03** It's not true.

**00:24:04** It's not automatically true that this is, this is the case, but I'm sometimes just

**00:24:09** hesitant to express this idea too much because I think people can trip

**00:24:12** over into cynicism too fast.

**00:24:14** I think we put weight in the idea of something sometimes too heavily.

**00:24:20** Like, yeah, this is science.

**00:24:24** Okay.

**00:24:25** Right.

**00:24:25** Like, you know what?

**00:24:25** Like this is science.

**00:24:27** So it must be true.

**00:24:28** It's science.

**00:24:30** Yeah.

**00:24:30** I really like, I don't want to get off on a tangent on this, but I feel like over

**00:24:34** the last 10 years, I've just gotten really sad with the way people use the word

**00:24:38** science.

**00:24:39** I've heard this word to describe it, which is like scientism, which describes

**00:24:45** the way that people talk about science.

**00:24:48** As someone who did a bachelor's in physics a long time ago, it's just, I don't

**00:24:52** know, there's something about it that really breaks my heart in the way that

**00:24:56** it's just become another one of these.

**00:24:57** Like you have to believe what I'm saying.

**00:24:59** Like this is science.

**00:25:00** Like, oh, she was like, did you look at that paper that you're pointing to?

**00:25:04** It's terrible.

**00:25:07** You know, this isn't a word that just wins an argument that says that you're right.

**00:25:11** But it's like, how do you express that idea without also unintentionally tearing

**00:25:16** down the entirety of our knowledge making institutions?

**00:25:20** I don't know a way to properly thread that needle sometimes.

**00:25:24** And also, like I was trying to express last time, that it's very different depending

**00:25:28** on which fields you're talking about.

**00:25:30** It's not equally applicable to everything.

**00:25:32** There's more problems in some areas than in other areas.

**00:25:35** But yeah, so the other thing that I thought was just interesting timing on the part

**00:25:41** of the universe was between when we recorded that episode and when we published

**00:25:47** that episode, there was another huge researcher who got wrapped up in the

**00:25:54** replication crisis, which is Dan Ariely.

**00:25:57** And he's been doing work for 10 years about honesty and like a bunch of studies

**00:26:03** about honesty in the social sciences.

**00:26:06** And it came out while we were editing this, like, let's just put it this way.

**00:26:10** There are some doubts about the veracity of this data about honesty.

**00:26:16** So it's really kicked up a lot of conversation again about the replication crisis

**00:26:20** and what's going on.

**00:26:22** I know you were particularly excited to send me that link.

**00:26:26** Like, I could feel it.

**00:26:27** It's happening again.

**00:26:28** You know, well, you know, it's just it's further example, Mike, that my attention

**00:26:32** directs the actions of the universe.

**00:26:34** It's like, oh, of course, this happens right now.

**00:26:36** Why wouldn't it?

**00:26:37** Interesting view to have.

**00:26:38** I think a lot of this stuff we'll get back to it in a minute, but like a lot of this

**00:26:42** stuff, it underlines like a thought that I've had since I was kind of like a late

**00:26:46** teen and not enjoying math anymore.

**00:26:49** I think it's a struggle with quite a bit and I still do it to an extent, which is

**00:26:54** everything we know has been explained by and codified by other humans.

**00:27:03** And humans make mistakes.

**00:27:08** Sometimes purely based on.

**00:27:12** The maximum amount of technology they have available to them.

**00:27:17** And as technology develops, we learn new things which invalidate the previous way

**00:27:24** that we thought about something.

**00:27:27** So if we base our truth on other human discoveries, it's only waiting until the

**00:27:32** next discovery is made to invalidate that previous truth.

**00:27:38** And I find that very troubling as a thought.

**00:27:42** Yeah.

**00:27:42** Like I think about the best example for me is like medicine and the way that we

**00:27:47** treated things 100 years ago, 20 years ago, to the way that we treat certain things

**00:27:53** now.

**00:27:55** And that's the kind of stuff where it's like, well, we thought we were doing the

**00:27:57** right thing because that was what we had discovered.

**00:28:01** But it turns out that there was a different thing or it was the wrong thing

**00:28:03** the whole time.

**00:28:04** Yeah.

**00:28:04** I mean, I have a little bit of a different take on this.

**00:28:07** And this is that idea that you're expressing is actually the idea that I am

**00:28:12** concerned about being too deep in people.

**00:28:15** Yeah.

**00:28:16** And it's because again, I know the social science people hate this, but you

**00:28:21** have to suck it up for a minute that your field is terrible and doesn't replicate.

**00:28:25** And medicine has a bunch of particular problems.

**00:28:29** But in general, the path of knowledge, the more you get down towards the

**00:28:35** fundamental pieces of the universe, the more it is like we are approaching

**00:28:40** building a model that represents what the universe is like.

**00:28:45** And this is why physics is really at the bottom of this, where you can look at the

**00:28:49** history of physics and go, oh, there was the, there's the Copernican revolution.

**00:28:54** And then there's the Newtonian revolution.

**00:28:56** And then there's the Einsteinian revolution.

**00:28:59** And I think it's easy for people to get the idea in their heads that, Oh,

**00:29:05** everything was wrong.

**00:29:06** And then Einstein came along and now we think everything that Einstein said was

**00:29:10** right, and we're just waiting for the next person to come along.

**00:29:13** And then it's all going to get turned over again.

**00:29:15** But in the physical world, when we're talking about those kinds of changes in

**00:29:19** science, what we're actually talking about is very small changes in increasing

**00:29:26** edge cases of how does the physical universe work.

**00:29:31** And so, you know, Einstein comes along with his theory of general relativity.

**00:29:35** And sure, there's a way that you can say, Oh, Newton's formulas of motion, they

**00:29:42** are now wrong, but they're only wrong for objects that are approaching the speed

**00:29:48** of light, right?

**00:29:49** Which is something that Newton just totally couldn't have known about.

**00:29:53** And so Einstein and Newton completely agree on the physics of how do objects

**00:29:59** move at everyday speeds and everyday sizes.

**00:30:02** There's like a refinement that's gone on there, but lots of sciences are not like

**00:30:08** the physical sciences.

**00:30:09** And that's where there is this, this difference.

**00:30:11** And I think medicine is a particularly interesting case because for a huge

**00:30:17** period of history, basically until the Spanish influenza in about 1912, you

**00:30:23** could kind of say that all medicine was just random ineffective guessing, like

**00:30:30** for the most part, medical treatment was just a total roll of the dice before 1912.

**00:30:38** And in 1912, we then learned some very basic things about hygiene and the germ

**00:30:45** theory and communicable diseases and sanitation.

**00:30:49** And we've reaped huge rewards from that over time.

**00:30:54** And it's like, why did we reap awards from that?

**00:30:56** Because what we learned about medicine represents the physical way that the

**00:31:02** world works, like we have a better understanding of that.

**00:31:06** But some of the modern medicine stuff doesn't work out as well because you're

**00:31:10** trying to measure like very small effect sizes across large populations.

**00:31:15** Medicine is just an intrinsically messier field.

**00:31:18** It's a lot, it's a lot harder to know certain kinds of things.

**00:31:23** The joke about this is always like, are eggs good for you or eggs bad for you?

**00:31:27** Right.

**00:31:28** But if we were to discover, oh, there's, there's definitely a measurable

**00:31:32** effect that eggs are bad for you.

**00:31:34** It doesn't like overturn, but we know washing hands is good.

**00:31:39** Like it's incredibly unlikely that we're going to discover at some point, oh, we

**00:31:44** were just making a mistake about washing hands.

**00:31:47** And the reason it's unlikely we're going to make a mistake about that is because

**00:31:52** it's built on a physical model of how does the world work.

**00:31:55** Like we have evidence that germs exist.

**00:31:57** We, we know the physics of why does soap kill germs?

**00:32:02** Why does it break cell walls down?

**00:32:04** Like we know all of these things.

**00:32:05** So you should be building up a stronger and stronger knowledge of how

**00:32:08** does the physical world work.

**00:32:10** But the further you get away from the physical world, the more you can be

**00:32:16** certain that the knowledge is uncertain.

**00:32:19** And that's what brings us to the social sciences, which are trying to study

**00:32:23** the interactions between humans, which while yes, at core, humans are just

**00:32:32** made of atoms and atoms follow physical rules.

**00:32:35** It's like, yeah, that's great.

**00:32:36** It's technically true, but it's totally useless for the people who are

**00:32:39** useless for talking about humans.

**00:32:41** So the way that we actually have to talk about how are humans under these

**00:32:46** circumstances, when do humans lie?

**00:32:49** When do humans act greedy?

**00:32:50** When do humans cheat each other?

**00:32:52** Like all of these things that we study, the uncertainty there is just huge

**00:32:57** because you're not really dealing with a physical world system.

**00:33:02** And it's why it's sort of brutal to say, but particularly in the social

**00:33:07** sciences, it's like, oh, if Einstein went back in time and could talk to Newton,

**00:33:15** he could teach Newton a lot about physics that Newton would understand and

**00:33:18** go, wow, that's amazing.

**00:33:20** But if social scientists go back in time, they're really just going to have

**00:33:25** like an ideological argument with their predecessors.

**00:33:29** They they're not going to have so much like a, here's the improvement we have

**00:33:34** made in the physical model of the universe argument.

**00:33:38** So I do believe that there is great value to be found in this kind of work,

**00:33:46** but it's the way that the conclusions are presented is the important part, I think.

**00:33:50** Yeah.

**00:33:50** So yeah, part of the problem here as well is when you talk about the social

**00:33:53** world is it's people talking about the results.

**00:33:56** So one of the things that I got a bit of criticism on on the last episode was why

**00:34:03** do you not get this angry at people for the business books that you read?

**00:34:09** Now, one, I feel like we do get angry with the business books, but maybe don't try

**00:34:13** and like fundamentally disagree with them and say you have no proof of this.

**00:34:19** The reason that the thinking fast and slow specifically perturbed me is that

**00:34:26** everything that was being posed in this book was being posed as science.

**00:34:31** Mm hmm.

**00:34:32** Where typically in the books that we read, they are posed as somebody's

**00:34:35** opinion or things they have observed.

**00:34:38** Yeah.

**00:34:38** And they say from these observations, I have drawn this conclusion, but they are

**00:34:42** not trying to suggest to me that it was done through a series of scientific

**00:34:48** experiments, and that makes a difference for me because now we're talking about

**00:34:54** in the effective executive is like, here's a bunch of ideas that I've come from my

**00:34:59** experience, which I like that kind of thing on a general level.

**00:35:03** But in thinking fast and slow, Kahneman saying to me, I have scientifically

**00:35:07** observed this here is truth.

**00:35:09** Yeah.

**00:35:09** And that distinction is important to me.

**00:35:12** Yeah, I think it's like listening to people talk about productivity.

**00:35:15** Like it's something I enjoy doing, listening to how people work.

**00:35:18** But people, when they talk that way, like when we talk about that, the sentence

**00:35:22** never ends with, and that's why everyone should work the way I do.

**00:35:26** I feel like we're pretty good with that.

**00:35:28** Like we talk about what we like and what works for us, but I don't think we've ever

**00:35:32** said like, this is the way to do it.

**00:35:35** Like this is the app.

**00:35:36** This is the system.

**00:35:37** If you're not doing it this way, except for the theme system, of course, if you're

**00:35:41** not doing it this way, it's all a mess for you and you won't make it work.

**00:35:45** But even the theme system is very flexible, right?

**00:35:47** On purpose.

**00:35:47** That's the point of it, right?

**00:35:48** For this reason, because of, because of our tastes, right?

**00:35:51** Which is why we don't, we have never defined like, uh, in this box, you write

**00:35:55** this in this box, you write this because that's not how we work.

**00:35:58** Like that's kind of the whole point because I bristled at so many of those

**00:36:02** things out there because they were trying to put me in boxes, as to say, like your

**00:36:06** life will improve if you do it the exact way that we want you to.

**00:36:09** And I don't like that kind of stuff.

**00:36:12** But, and like, and I feel like as well, like we have, I believe shown over time

**00:36:15** with the way that we get our work done.

**00:36:18** That we change.

**00:36:20** So we would never say like, this is the only way to do it.

**00:36:24** And that's, I think the main thing that frustrated me because I do feel like, as

**00:36:28** I said, I feel like there is value in the social sciences, but we need to understand

**00:36:32** that they are, that they are flexible and much more opinionated than physical sciences.

**00:36:38** Yeah.

**00:36:39** I mean, I can't quite get behind that sentence because I feel like that's

**00:36:41** a sentence if you write it down, I go, what does that, what does that sentence

**00:36:44** mean?

**00:36:45** What does that sentence try to say?

**00:36:46** What I was trying to say there is I feel like, I feel like at least from my

**00:36:50** limited experience that say some of the stuff in thinking fast and slow, he will

**00:36:56** observe something and then say, I believe it means this basically, but the, I

**00:37:01** believe part is taken away.

**00:37:02** I'll give you a sentence that I highlighted last time when I was, I was sad

**00:37:05** that we missed over it.

**00:37:06** Okay.

**00:37:07** Kahneman has an amazing sentence.

**00:37:08** I think it's at the end of chapter four where he says, disbelief is not an option.

**00:37:15** These results are not made up, nor are they statistical flukes.

**00:37:19** You have no choice, but to accept that the major conclusions of these studies are true.

**00:37:25** I hate that so much.

**00:37:26** Like that is the reason that really stuck out to me is I thought, you know, I've, I've

**00:37:34** had the experience of working with physicists who would not make a sentence.

**00:37:37** That's right.

**00:37:38** It's like, if you tell me this, I am not going to believe you.

**00:37:42** You have no choice, but to accept that the major conclusions of these studies are true.

**00:37:48** It's really, it's quite, it's amazing.

**00:37:52** And considering everything that's happened since that sentence is extra

**00:37:55** amazing for a bunch of reasons, but it's, it's like, we weren't just pulling out of

**00:38:00** nowhere Kahneman is telling you like these things are true.

**00:38:03** You, you have no choice, but to just go along with it.

**00:38:06** He literally says disbelief is not an option.

**00:38:10** It's just like, I've been in churches that wouldn't make that sentence.

**00:38:14** Right.

**00:38:14** It's crazy.

**00:38:16** Again, it's just like, what annoys me is I've, I've really taken some thing away from

**00:38:21** system one and system two, like over the last few weeks, it's been popping up.

**00:38:24** Like I've done a thing and I'm like, that was system one way of doing things.

**00:38:28** Like I just reacted in immediately without thinking, you know, and like, so that I

**00:38:33** genuinely believe that there is value in this book.

**00:38:37** It just wasn't presented to me in a way that I was comfortable with.

**00:38:41** Yeah, it wasn't.

**00:38:42** And then you made it worse.

**00:38:44** And then I made it worse.

**00:38:45** So I do with the replication crisis, I do just want to follow up just a couple of

**00:38:50** things that I think were interesting for like after the show and what happened

**00:38:53** about the book, not just that, oh, now the universe is tossing up the replication

**00:38:58** crisis again.

**00:38:58** And so a bunch of like writers and podcasters I follow are also talking about

**00:39:02** it because of the Dan Ariely thing, which I can just say is an interesting case of

**00:39:07** there's a question of did this major researcher fabricate data?

**00:39:11** And who knows if it's true?

**00:39:13** I don't know if it's true.

**00:39:14** I haven't looked into it that much, but it doesn't matter to me because it still

**00:39:18** gets to the heart of the replication crisis where one of the most high profile

**00:39:22** researchers, no one tried to replicate his results for 10 years.

**00:39:27** And it just stood as a thing where people are like, Oh, it's true.

**00:39:31** Yeah, it must be true.

**00:39:33** And it's also like, it doesn't matter whether he lied.

**00:39:36** Someone will.

**00:39:38** Yes.

**00:39:38** Someone, you know, somebody's going to because they're human beings.

**00:39:42** Yeah, exactly.

**00:39:43** You have to know that when people's careers depend on publishing papers that

**00:39:50** other people cite, there is going to be an incentive to make interesting,

**00:39:55** sightable papers, which does not always align with the incentive of accurately

**00:40:00** describing how the world works.

**00:40:02** So if you can write a paper that you know will one, get a lot of attention and that

**00:40:07** two people in your field will love and want to link to, there's a big incentive

**00:40:12** to write that paper, even if it's not based on anything.

**00:40:15** But so just a couple of little things I just want to mention that happened

**00:40:18** since the book was published that I just, I think are great and that we could just

**00:40:22** kind of close this forever.

**00:40:24** But so where is the link?

**00:40:27** I stumbled upon, there's a great blog post that tries to summarize a whole bunch of

**00:40:33** the replicability of Kahneman's work.

**00:40:37** Oh yeah, there it is.

**00:40:38** So it's this replication replicability index.com.

**00:40:42** Wrote this article a couple of years ago called reconstruction of a train wreck,

**00:40:48** how priming research went off the rails.

**00:40:51** Oh my God, that title.

**00:40:53** So it's an interesting article.

**00:40:55** I won't, we'll put it in the show notes.

**00:40:56** I won't go through all of this, but just a couple of things that are

**00:40:59** interesting to point out.

**00:41:00** So the title actually comes from Kahneman.

**00:41:03** So my guess about this book being published right at the end of when it was

**00:41:08** possible to publish this book looks like it was correct.

**00:41:12** Because the year after it came out, when people had lots of suspicions about these

**00:41:17** sorts of studies being replicable Kahneman wrote an open email to his colleagues who

**00:41:23** had done a bunch of this work.

**00:41:25** And I think this quote from this email is astounding.

**00:41:27** So I'm just going to read this.

**00:41:29** This is from Kahneman in an open email.

**00:41:31** As all of you know, of course, questions have been raised about the

**00:41:34** robustness of priming results.

**00:41:37** Your field is now the poster child for doubts about the integrity of

**00:41:41** psychological research.

**00:41:43** People have now attached a question mark to the field and it is your

**00:41:46** responsibility to remove it.

**00:41:48** All I have personally at stake is that I recently wrote a book that emphasizes

**00:41:53** priming research as a new approach to the study of associative memory.

**00:41:57** Count me as a general believer.

**00:41:59** My reason for writing this letter is that I see a train wreck looming.

**00:42:03** So that's where the title of this article comes from.

**00:42:05** Do you not think it might have been your fault then?

**00:42:08** I mean, I think that is a very interestingly worded open email.

**00:42:14** And it is worth, I think the quote here, it looks like it has been in this blog

**00:42:18** post because there's a lot of ellipses has been like chopped up.

**00:42:21** Yeah, it is.

**00:42:22** It is a chopped up quote, which is fair to say, but I still think like the basic

**00:42:25** sentences there are conveying a certain idea that Kahneman has reinforced at

**00:42:31** later points in time.

**00:42:32** But so it's this really interesting thing that goes through and tries to talk about

**00:42:36** what is the replicability of the studies that are in the book.

**00:42:39** And the bottom line is the researcher comes up with this score of a

**00:42:44** replicability index where you can say, oh, if a paper scores below 50, it means

**00:42:48** that it was probably the result is by chance.

**00:42:51** And the average score of the studies cited in the book is 14.

**00:42:56** It's a one to 100 scale.

**00:42:59** It's brutal.

**00:43:00** Like some of the specific studies are scored at like six, which is like, you

**00:43:06** can say, oh, it's almost certain that this will never replicate.

**00:43:10** Okay.

**00:43:11** This is, this is a little complicated, I think, for me to get my head around, but

**00:43:15** basically what you're saying is you have a score of up to a hundred, right?

**00:43:20** Imagine it's like a math test or whatever.

**00:43:23** And Kahneman's work scored 14 out of a hundred.

**00:43:26** Yeah.

**00:43:27** Well, again, it's not his work.

**00:43:28** It's, it's the things that are being cited in the book.

**00:43:31** The things that he is showing in thinking fast and slow.

**00:43:34** Yeah.

**00:43:34** Is that what he's saying?

**00:43:35** Yes.

**00:43:35** You're trying to do a statistical analysis, which says you can use a combination

**00:43:38** of things, you can say, what is the strength of the effect that you're trying

**00:43:42** to measure?

**00:43:43** So if an effect is very strong, you should be able to measure it with fewer people.

**00:43:47** And then they're saying, you know, what is the number of people that you

**00:43:49** studied this effect on?

**00:43:52** So you can use those numbers to come up with a rough, how replicable might this

**00:43:57** be at all kind of score.

**00:44:00** And so this is a little bit of what I was talking about last time, where you just

**00:44:04** like people who are not good at math, don't make it in the physical sciences,

**00:44:10** but you can make it in the social sciences.

**00:44:13** It's really interesting.

**00:44:13** So anyway, this article goes through this whole thing.

**00:44:15** It is, there's no other way to describe it.

**00:44:18** It's brutal.

**00:44:18** Like the description of the studies and the likelihood of them

**00:44:21** replicating is brutal.

**00:44:23** The number of them that have never been attempted to be replicated.

**00:44:25** It's, it's absolutely awful.

**00:44:27** But what's really interesting is that Kahneman himself actually replied to this

**00:44:33** thing, he leaves a comment at the bottom.

**00:44:35** And so here's his remark on it.

**00:44:38** What this blog post gets absolutely right is that I placed too much faith in

**00:44:43** underpowered studies, as pointed out in the blog, there is a special irony in my

**00:44:48** mistake, because the first paper that I published was about the belief in the

**00:44:52** law of small numbers, which allows researchers to trust the results of

**00:44:56** underpowered studies with unreasonably small sample sizes.

**00:45:01** I failed to internalize this message.

**00:45:04** So Kahneman here does admit and does say that like, Oh yeah, tons of the studies

**00:45:11** have tiny sample sizes, so they can't possibly be measuring, measuring what

**00:45:14** they claim to be measuring, but it still ends in this weird way.

**00:45:20** So he's now talking about chapters three and four.

**00:45:22** He says, clearly the experimental evidence for the ideas I presented were

**00:45:26** significantly weaker than I believed when I wrote it.

**00:45:29** This was simply an error.

**00:45:31** I knew all I needed to know to moderate my enthusiasm for the surprising and

**00:45:35** elegant findings that I cited, but I did not think it through.

**00:45:39** I am still attached to every study that I cited and have not unbelieved them.

**00:45:45** I would be happy to see each of them replicated in a large sample size.

**00:45:49** The lesson I have learned, however, is that authors who review a field should be

**00:45:53** wary of using memorable results of underpowered studies as evidence for

**00:45:58** their claims.

**00:46:01** So I just think it's like, Oh,

**00:46:03** here's what I don't understand.

**00:46:06** So this was in 2017.

**00:46:09** Why is the book still being sold unaltered?

**00:46:12** That's what I want to know.

**00:46:14** If he believes this now, why is there now not at least an updated

**00:46:18** forward from Kahneman where he explains that where it's like, this is the book

**00:46:23** that I wrote then since then.

**00:46:25** Some of the examples have been caught into doubt.

**00:46:28** I still believe everything that you're about to read.

**00:46:32** You know what I mean?

**00:46:32** Like, cause he's saying here, he stands by it, which respect to him, right?

**00:46:35** Stand by your work if you believe in it and you still want to make money from it.

**00:46:39** Right.

**00:46:39** Like if you think it should be sold still, you have to stand by it and he's

**00:46:43** doing that and that's fine.

**00:46:44** Right.

**00:46:45** But I didn't know any of this when I started reading, thinking fast and slow.

**00:46:49** So I'm buying the book and believing what he has to say.

**00:46:53** And it wouldn't bother me if he did that.

**00:46:56** Right.

**00:46:56** Like if there was a new forward and it was like, this was written a long time ago.

**00:47:00** This is what I knew back then or believed in it back then.

**00:47:02** I stand by everything.

**00:47:04** But the validity of some of these experiments has been called into question.

**00:47:10** Yeah.

**00:47:11** You know, because this is what I'm, what I wanted to get across.

**00:47:14** Like I have no issue if that's the case because it doesn't bother me.

**00:47:21** And what I would prefer is if he just explained these things that he believes,

**00:47:25** these conclusions that he's drawn in a human to human way.

**00:47:31** But the problem with the book, I'll say it again.

**00:47:34** All he wants to do is tell me about the experiments, the science of what he's

**00:47:39** done as a way to prove the conclusions that he draws.

**00:47:46** And so I'm only more annoyed now because in 2017 he was like, oh, I'm not so sure

**00:47:54** about this anymore, but it's 2021 and I can still give him money for his book.

**00:48:00** Yeah.

**00:48:00** That that's the thing that I, uh, going through this and reading his responses,

**00:48:04** they're carefully worded sentences, but I was surprised that the current editions

**00:48:10** of the book make absolutely no reference to this.

**00:48:14** And like, I am not like, I'm not saying the book shouldn't be sold, right?

**00:48:18** Like, Oh, burn the book, take it off the shelf.

**00:48:20** I'm not saying that either.

**00:48:21** Yeah.

**00:48:21** But I feel like there should be some kind of reference to this.

**00:48:29** That just seems so strange to me that the author publicly says it.

**00:48:33** That's the part that's weird.

**00:48:35** People saying like that blog post existing doesn't make me feel like

**00:48:40** Kahneman needs to update the book.

**00:48:42** Right.

**00:48:42** But if Kahneman will say it, if you ask him, right, why doesn't he tell me?

**00:48:48** Right.

**00:48:49** This is the interesting thing.

**00:48:49** Like people can criticize other people's ideas all the time.

**00:48:52** And the originator of the ideas cannot necessarily agree or whatever.

**00:48:57** But this is a case where it's like, Oh, this brutal take down of the work.

**00:49:02** And the author's like, I agree.

**00:49:04** Although comma, I don't unbelieve my ideas still.

**00:49:08** And I would love to see them replicated.

**00:49:10** Like, yeah, of course you would love to see them replicate them as much as you like.

**00:49:15** Right.

**00:49:16** Yeah.

**00:49:17** But to conclude with like the lesson I have learned is that authors who review

**00:49:20** a field should be wary of using memorable results of underpowered studies as

**00:49:23** evidence for their claim and that clearly the experimental evidence for the ideas

**00:49:27** I presented in the chapter were significantly weaker than I believed when I wrote it.

**00:49:31** Like maybe take out that sentence of disbelief is not an option.

**00:49:36** The results are not made up, nor are they statistical flukes.

**00:49:39** You have no choice but to accept that the major conclusions of these studies are true.

**00:49:44** It's true.

**00:49:44** Got him.

**00:49:45** Like, got him.

**00:49:47** It's brutal.

**00:49:49** That is incredible to put those two things next to each other.

**00:49:52** And again, it's like, this wouldn't be fair.

**00:49:56** I feel like it wouldn't be fair if we were taking this from like a blog post he wrote in 2015 and said like, hey, look, you said this back then.

**00:50:06** How can you because I like I believe people can change their views.

**00:50:10** But if you've changed your view and you sell a product, you've got to you got to change.

**00:50:16** You've got to make an amendment to the book.

**00:50:18** Yeah.

**00:50:18** Like I've been seeing this book in every airport I've ever gone to in a prominent place for years.

**00:50:24** I'm sure I'm going to see it when I get to the airport in a couple of days.

**00:50:28** Like it's going to be thinking fast and slow.

**00:50:31** That's why we did this book.

**00:50:33** We had to pick one and we've seen it everywhere forever.

**00:50:37** Exactly.

**00:50:38** And considering he just published a new book, you've got to assume that they're reprinting this one.

**00:50:45** Yeah, that's why that's this.

**00:50:47** This is wild to me.

**00:50:48** This is wild to me.

**00:50:50** You know, we're not trying to do it.

**00:50:52** Take down here of someone.

**00:50:54** Again, it's such a weird position to be in because if we keep saying like I actually agree with the fundamental thesis of the book on like in almost every general way.

**00:51:02** System one and two is so good.

**00:51:05** It's so good.

**00:51:06** It's so clever.

**00:51:08** It's like just a great way of encapsulating something.

**00:51:11** And if like this was thinking fast and slow by like Steven Levy, right.

**00:51:16** Or he's not pretending to be a scientist.

**00:51:18** We would have come away from it and been like great.

**00:51:21** Yeah.

**00:51:21** Right.

**00:51:23** So it's just it's such a weird thing of like, oh, there's a lot of work that says humans aren't perfect economic rational decision makers.

**00:51:30** Like, yeah, right behind you on that dude.

**00:51:33** Having done a lot of research, it sure seems like Kahneman is right at the heart of this replication crisis and it's like sort of going along with it.

**00:51:42** Yeah, weirdly chooses to be as well.

**00:51:45** It makes choices in his life to be a part of it, which is very peculiar to me.

**00:51:52** Yeah, it's the whole thing is very strange.

**00:51:54** So anyway, I felt like because we had such an impassioned conversation about that book and because all of this stuff happened and then like finding out the author's own comments on afterwards, it just felt like it had to be brought up again as boy, you could do a lot of interesting reading about thinking fast and slow after you read the book, thinking fast and slow.

**00:52:14** It's very strange.

**00:52:16** And I guess we'll see how this this conversation goes on.

**00:52:19** I guess.

**00:52:22** Yeah, see you on Reddit.

**00:52:23** Man, I wasn't expecting us to get this fired up again.

**00:52:27** This book, man, is going to be the bane of our existence.

**00:54:12** OK, so we are still in September.

**00:54:14** Do we know that to be true?

**00:54:15** In our out of time time, September is Childhood Cancer Awareness Month.

**00:54:19** And for the third consecutive year, Relay FM is supporting the lifesaving mission of St.

**00:54:24** Jude Children's Research Hospital.

**00:54:26** And that is finding cures and saving children.

**00:54:29** Why do we do this?

**00:54:29** Well, for almost 60 years, St.

**00:54:31** Jude Children's Research Hospital has been on the front lines of research, care and treatment of childhood cancer.

**00:54:38** Treatments invented at St.

**00:54:39** Jude have helped push the overall childhood cancer survival rate from 20% to more than 80% since opening.

**00:54:46** They just flipped it.

**00:54:48** With one in five children not surviving, though, St.

**00:54:51** Jude is not going to stop until no child dies from cancer, but they need our support.

**00:54:56** So this September, you can help Relay FM surpass over $1 million raised for the kids of St.

**00:55:02** Jude during our third annual Relay FM for St.

**00:55:06** Jude fundraising campaign.

**00:55:07** Honestly, Gray, by the time this episode goes out, we might have gotten there to that million.

**00:55:12** I hope so. It's an incredible number.

**00:55:14** Right now we have raised, we just went up as I opened the page, $174,174.11 is where we are today.

**00:55:24** Right.

**00:55:24** We need to get to 196 to raise a million over the three years.

**00:55:29** So I feel somewhat confident that by the time people are listening to this episode, we have surpassed that

**00:55:36** $1 million.

**00:55:38** And if that is the case, I cannot express how grateful I am to our audience for making that happen.

**00:55:47** A million dollars is just an incredible sum of money.

**00:55:50** And for everyone to come together over these last three years to donate that to St.

**00:55:54** Jude is I genuinely mean this.

**00:55:58** One of the greatest accomplishments of my professional career that I have.

**00:56:02** We consider this like every year to be so important.

**00:56:05** But like I love what I do.

**00:56:08** I love that I get to do this stuff to be able to be a part of.

**00:56:16** Making a change to.

**00:56:19** Donate to an institution like this one.

**00:56:23** It kind of is like a weird way of like makes all of this kind of worth it.

**00:56:30** It gives me these incredible feelings every year.

**00:56:33** It's why we love doing the podcast as well because it's like that is like a focused time.

**00:56:39** Right.

**00:56:39** Like we do this for like a six week period every year.

**00:56:42** But on that day.

**00:56:45** It's all it is.

**00:56:46** You know, like my entire day is talking about St.

**00:56:49** Jude watching videos about St.

**00:56:51** Jude interviewing doctors.

**00:56:52** We interview patients like that's where this this incredible focus is.

**00:56:57** And I mean, last year we raised one hundred thousand dollars during the podcast.

**00:57:02** I have no idea what's going to happen this time.

**00:57:04** I would love to be.

**00:57:05** So by the way, tune in on September 17th at Twitch TV.

**00:57:08** So I should relay FM and like help us beat that.

**00:57:11** Like because we get to compete against ourselves every year while at the same time

**00:57:17** raising an incredible amount of money for an incredible charity.

**00:57:21** Yeah, it's a good way to compete against yourself.

**00:57:23** Yeah, it's pretty.

**00:57:24** I also just think it speaks to the generosity and the caring of the audience.

**00:57:28** Yeah, like it really is just astounding how much is given.

**00:57:32** Like I would never have guessed these kinds of numbers.

**00:57:34** So again, thank you so much to the audience for so much for donating to this.

**00:57:39** It's it's really incredible.

**00:57:41** And if you want to donate and help us continue to set goals and milestones,

**00:57:46** go to St Jude dot org slash relay.

**00:57:49** If you donate more than one hundred dollars in a single gift, you will receive an exclusive

**00:57:53** relay FM sticker, a thanks pack at the end of the campaign.

**00:57:56** And if your company matches charitable donations that can be added into our total.

**00:58:01** So just send us an email.

**00:58:03** Go just email Stephen at relay dot FM as S T E P H E N at relay dot FM

**00:58:09** with just the receipt of your company donation.

**00:58:11** And we can add that into our total as well.

**00:58:13** So that would be great.

**00:58:14** And also, if you didn't know that check if your company matches charitable donations

**00:58:18** because they might.

**00:58:19** And that's more money that goes to St Jude.

**00:58:21** Now double your effectiveness with one question.

**00:58:24** Exactly. Do you charity match?

**00:58:26** That's all you need to ask.

**00:58:28** And then you can double it, which is an incredible thing.

**00:58:31** And it's a big thing for us.

**00:58:33** Like we're lucky to have a lot of people on our audience that work for a lot of tech

**00:58:37** focused companies and a lot of tech focused companies do this.

**00:58:40** And it helps us raise even more money.

**00:58:43** So thank you so much if you have donated and thank you so much.

**00:58:47** If you will go to St Jude dot org slash relay.

**00:58:50** Let's cure childhood cancer together.

**00:58:53** You're a busy man, Mike.

**00:58:57** Yeah, every every September I feel the same way.

**00:59:00** I just I don't know how you do all the things that you do.

**00:59:05** Yeah, I mean, I feel it.

**00:59:08** Especially like I've got this little thing in the back of my mind, which is like

**00:59:12** yearly theme.

**00:59:14** Yeah, no, yearly themes are coming up.

**00:59:16** I feel that way, too.

**00:59:19** I've started an Apple note and I started writing some things down.

**00:59:22** I mean, I feel like I always get to this point if I start it right now where I'm

**00:59:26** like.

**00:59:27** Less work next year, less commitments, you know, like I write that every time.

**00:59:35** But when I then sit down to actually think about it, I'm like, I can't let go of

**00:59:40** anything. Who knows what's going to happen next year?

**00:59:42** No spoilers.

**00:59:43** But that's coming up soon.

**00:59:46** Right.

**00:59:47** Like we have three more episodes this year after this one and state of the apps in

**00:59:53** November, which I'm excited about.

**00:59:56** I'm actually really excited about state of the apps this year because I've been doing

**00:59:59** a lot of things differently that I haven't spoken about and I've been holding it and

**01:00:03** people keep asking me, what is that app on your iPhone?

**01:00:06** Like if I share my home screen, I'm like, I'm not telling you because I'm waiting for

**01:00:09** state of the apps.

**01:00:10** Very exciting.

**01:00:11** And yearly themes.

**01:00:12** Obviously, I'm excited about that.

**01:00:14** But like I'm preparing for those now.

**01:00:15** Like the other day I re-download the episodes because I like to listen to previous

**01:00:19** years. I'm getting ready.

**01:00:21** So it is kind of wild to think that like there's three more episodes for the year.

**01:00:27** I can't believe how the fastest year has gone.

**01:00:31** No, it's absolutely shocking.

**01:00:32** It's also why I've had yearly themes whispering in the back of my brain too, because it

**01:00:36** feels like, wait, didn't we just did that?

**01:00:39** Has it been a year?

**01:00:41** No, it can't possibly have been.

**01:00:42** You're finally going to set a theme around the same time as me because usually you get

**01:00:46** them in the summer, but this one's creeped up on you.

**01:00:48** Yeah, what summer?

**01:00:49** There was no summer.

**01:00:52** Yeah, it's just that swamp I've been trudging through miserably.

**01:00:57** But obviously, with yearly themes, one of the other things I'm working on right now is

**01:01:02** preparing for journals.

**01:01:06** I mean, our expectation is yearly themed setting time will always be our biggest time of

**01:01:15** the year for journals.

**01:01:17** Yeah.

**01:01:17** That's how it's been so far.

**01:01:19** I mean, we can assume it's probably going to be that way.

**01:01:21** That is the expectation.

**01:01:23** That is the assumption.

**01:01:24** But it doesn't help when once again, we have to have conversations about.

**01:01:31** But how much are you willing to bet on that?

**01:01:35** We had our meeting before the show today.

**01:01:37** Yeah.

**01:01:38** We were talking about stock and, you know, it's going over paper shortages again.

**01:01:43** And we have we have right now more in stock than we have sold for this entire year in

**01:01:51** preparation for the beginning of the year, which logically would suggest we're going to

**01:02:00** be OK.

**01:02:02** But we have no way of knowing.

**01:02:04** And that is so terrifying because we're making bets with our money.

**01:02:11** Right.

**01:02:12** Like it's really like this is I find Cortex brand so exciting, but also so intimidating.

**01:02:19** Yes, I completely agree.

**01:02:22** I was I was thinking when we were having our conversation about like, oh, the details about

**01:02:27** stock levels and how much money to spend on various things.

**01:02:31** I realized that with our first product, we accidentally wandered into a seasonal business,

**01:02:37** the most terrifying of businesses to try to run, which is just like it's just the nature of the

**01:02:43** thing that lots more people are going to buy a thing about starting your yearly theme in

**01:02:49** December and January.

**01:02:51** And it's like, oh, my God, for seasonal businesses, you think, oh, it's terrifying having to make

**01:02:58** these decisions.

**01:02:59** Because it takes multiple years to try and understand because like for any patent, you have

**01:03:05** to go through it a bunch of times.

**01:03:06** Right.

**01:03:07** But if your patent is once a year, it takes a long time to understand what's going to happen.

**01:03:15** So, yeah, we're in that kind of kind of mode right now.

**01:03:18** Plus, I mean, plus, I think it's pretty fair to say that we have gotten a little punch drunk in

**01:03:25** the idea of creating products.

**01:03:27** Yeah.

**01:03:29** Yeah.

**01:03:31** I like behind the scenes listeners.

**01:03:33** I messaged Mike like a week ago, like, hey, like, you know, like I woke up.

**01:03:37** Oh, my God.

**01:03:38** Listen, you need to make this thing.

**01:03:39** Here's what we're going to do.

**01:03:41** Because we have learned how to do things like now we can't stop doing things.

**01:03:48** So right now we are worklessly working on our journal stock.

**01:03:52** We have an accessory that we're working on and a brand new product.

**01:03:57** Plus now, as of today, I'm going to start working on another one.

**01:04:04** And we don't really know when these things are going to be available.

**01:04:07** Like, I had hoped I could maybe try and do it all by the end of the year.

**01:04:10** Gray told me that that was the method of a madman.

**01:04:15** Yeah, I was like, veto on that.

**01:04:18** If you think all of this stuff is going to be done by the end of the year, you are a madman.

**01:04:23** Like, and that's a terrible idea.

**01:04:25** No.

**01:04:27** So but I'm work.

**01:04:27** We're working on stuff and I actually want to try something out that we've not done before.

**01:04:32** And this is OK.

**01:04:34** This is weird for us because longtime listeners will know that me, especially Gray, are very

**01:04:40** cagey about talking about things that aren't real yet.

**01:04:44** Right.

**01:04:45** So, you know, like when Gray will talk about a video, he won't tell you what it is until it's done.

**01:04:51** And I'm somewhat similar and have been with these products.

**01:04:54** Right.

**01:04:55** I have been very hesitant to talk about changes that we're making and things that we're working on.

**01:05:00** You know, initially, I was pretty hesitant to talk about how many would sold all that kind of stuff

**01:05:06** because I just I feel like I've that's kind of like the area I've come from.

**01:05:11** Like, you kind of keep it to yourself until you're ready to share it.

**01:05:16** And I think a lot of that stuff comes in like software and technology, you know, which is where I kind of come from.

**01:05:20** Like you don't talk about what you're working on until it is a real thing.

**01:05:26** But in other areas that I follow, people talk more about what they're working on.

**01:05:33** And we've done a little bit of that on the show, but I want to get a bit more kind of visual with it.

**01:05:38** So we have an Instagram account.

**01:05:40** It's at Cortex brand is our Instagram account.

**01:05:44** And I am going to start now posting more behind the scenes stuff of products that we're working on,

**01:05:52** ideas that we have and just see if people are interested in that.

**01:05:56** So if you like hearing us talk about this kind of stuff, maybe you would also appreciate that.

**01:06:01** So it's going to be on the at Cortex brand Instagram account.

**01:06:04** So maybe that accessory new product that I was talking about, you might see some stuff about that.

**01:06:09** It also brings up an interesting point because obviously we're running Cortex brand together.

**01:06:14** And this is one of these cases where people don't always agree on everything.

**01:06:18** And I don't agree with you on this.

**01:06:20** No. So Mike is a big proponent of this idea.

**01:06:25** And as the other person involved in this, I view the Instagram showing the behind the scenes stuff as a total waste of time and energy.

**01:06:36** Fair enough. But I'll tell you why I want to do it because I feel like if I do this, there'll be a couple of things happening.

**01:06:44** One, I will get to talk more and crystallize my ideas more, which I appreciate, which I was value doing when we talk.

**01:06:51** But just in general, the other is if I can get feedback that's valuable before I send something to print, that will be good for me.

**01:07:01** Now, I'll say, like, I will. I'm sure I'm going to get lots of feedback, but I'm not going to consider it all valuable.

**01:07:07** Our products are where they come from our opinions. Right.

**01:07:10** And people want to do things in different ways.

**01:07:13** However, what I do know is Journal Version one to Journal Version two picked up a lot of changes based on feedback from people that used it.

**01:07:22** And I'm wondering if maybe people seeing stuff, they might be like, hey, does it do this or hey, why don't you do that?

**01:07:28** And there might be the occasional thing where I'm like, you know what? Great idea.

**01:07:34** We'll see. Yeah. I like this.

**01:07:35** I like this as well for talking about in the show, because it is rare that we will do something if the two of us don't agree on it.

**01:07:43** But this isn't one of those things where like I'm going rogue.

**01:07:46** Gray doesn't think it's a great idea, but he has no problem in me doing it.

**01:07:50** Yeah. And this is what I mean by I think it's sort of an interesting point about working with someone where it's like, yeah, I do.

**01:07:57** Very strongly think it is a waste of time and energy to do the behind the scenes stuff on the Instagram.

**01:08:04** But it's also not a place where I'm going to go like, I hard veto this.

**01:08:09** Right. Like, this is not your energy.

**01:08:11** Is there either, you know, I waste my energy.

**01:08:16** Yeah, I don't know. I don't have to do it, which certainly helps.

**01:08:19** If I had to be involved in it more directly, I'd be like, no, that's LOL.

**01:08:22** That's not going to happen. I think it's a waste of time.

**01:08:24** But it's also one of these cases where I also have to acknowledge you are way more connected into this world than I am.

**01:08:31** And so it's very possible that I'm wrong.

**01:08:34** And so that's why I'm like, give it a give it a try.

**01:08:38** See if it works. See if you find it effective.

**01:08:40** See if people like it and see if it translates directly into sales.

**01:08:45** Again, I'm doubtful about that, but it's not a strong enough thought that it would make sense to say no.

**01:08:52** And it is also not the area that I am the expert in.

**01:08:56** So I guess if you want to prove me wrong and Mike Wright, go follow Cortex Brand on Instagram.

**01:09:01** I'll be like genuinely curious to see how this goes and what you try to do with it.

**01:09:06** But yeah, I don't know. My default position is still.

**01:09:10** You know, talk about things when you have an action for people to perform, which is like you can preorder it right now at the very least.

**01:09:18** And I don't like talking about stuff before there's an action for the person to take.

**01:09:23** But well, I agree with you to a point, which is that I believe that we have stages of places where we can tell people to do something.

**01:09:36** And like there is more people that listen to the show than will follow the Instagram account.

**01:09:42** Right. Yes. Yeah.

**01:09:43** So my thinking is on the show, we don't really talk about upcoming products until they're ready.

**01:09:50** Yes, because this is the largest audience.

**01:09:53** So and then, you know, even greater, if you promote one of our products on your YouTube channel, it's the biggest possible audience.

**01:09:59** Right. You know, I feel like there's a stage like if you show something on the YouTube channel, it's completed and available.

**01:10:05** Right. On this show, we sometimes tease that we're working on something like we just have.

**01:10:09** But then on the Instagram, we'll actually show you some of it.

**01:10:12** And so it's like this staging of depending on how interested you are, you can tune in at any one of those points and then make to decide to make a purchasing decision.

**01:10:21** Even with your YouTube channel, it's immediately available with our show.

**01:10:26** It's available or it might be coming soon in the Instagram account.

**01:10:30** This might never happen, but we're working on it.

**01:10:33** And maybe in six months you'll get it.

**01:10:35** That's how I think of it.

**01:10:36** Here's the design prototype on the Instagram.

**01:10:38** Yeah. And then it kind of like goes forward from there.

**01:10:41** And it's about how how engaged are you with what we're doing here?

**01:10:47** And you can choose as a listener at any point in that process.

**01:10:52** If you just want to just like, I don't tell me about it until it's done.

**01:10:56** You're in the right spot already.

**01:10:58** But if you are intrigued about what it's like to try and do this stuff, then you can go there and you can get it, which is why sometimes as well, like we've had some of some more detailed conversations in more text.

**01:11:10** Yeah, because people that want to pay for more for the show are naturally more interested, I feel like.

**01:11:17** And so we've had some more details about upcoming stuff in more text.

**01:11:22** So it's like, that's the stage.

**01:11:23** So I guess it would go YouTube channel cortex more text at cortex brand Instagram.

**01:11:29** Right. That's how I view it.

**01:11:31** Tick tock. No, no, no, no.

**01:11:34** You know, if you if you ever played around with tick tock.

**01:11:40** No, I have not looked at the talk and how it ticks.

**01:11:44** So no, I've literally never even seen the app.

**01:11:47** So I'm very out of touch with tick tock.

**01:11:49** But I hear all the kids love it.

**01:11:51** Me too. I.

**01:11:53** Why do you why do you sound so sad about that?

**01:11:55** I'm not sad about it. I'm not sad about it.

**01:11:57** I don't want to to like age myself out, you know, but I do feel like it's maybe just not the not the social network or not the app.

**01:12:08** I need right now.

**01:12:11** So I'm very much like a subscription box person, you know, and that's exactly not what tick tock is.

**01:12:21** What tick tock wants to do is just serve you more content based on an algorithm.

**01:12:26** And I understand the algorithm is very good and like will show you the things that you like because you just engage with what you do and don't.

**01:12:34** I get it, but I'm very much like a I have subscriptions on YouTube and I save the things I want to watch time.

**01:12:42** I watch later. Like I'm very particular about that.

**01:12:45** Like I never watch videos from the YouTube homepage.

**01:12:49** I don't care about the YouTube homepage, you know.

**01:12:51** Right. So no promotions on tick tock then.

**01:12:54** Not yet. I want you know, you never rule it out, but no tick tock for now.

**01:13:28** And every single exercise that's inside of Fitbot has videos from these trainers showing you how they're done.

**01:13:34** This is something I absolutely love.

**01:13:36** When I'm starting a new exercise or a new routine, I want to see someone do it and see how it's done.

**01:13:40** I get instructions, but I also want to see an example so I can compare as to how I'm doing it to your workout program in Fitbot to be tailored exactly to meet your own needs.

**01:13:50** This makes it perfectly suited to your unique body experience, environment and goals.

**01:13:55** Because it can be hard to know exactly how much you should be doing while exercising.

**01:13:58** So Fitbot figures that out for you so you don't have to worry about under or over training.

**01:14:03** And it's also going to mix up your muscle groups, exercises, sets, reps and weight over time.

**01:14:08** It's going to keep you in top form while also making sure that you're staying on the right path for you to help you take the steps that you want to become a better version of yourself.

**01:14:17** If you're at home right now, Fitbot has a bunch of bodyweight only workouts.

**01:14:53** A thanks to Fitbot for their continued support of this show and relay FM.

**01:14:58** So we spoke about what I have got going on or what we have got going on.

**01:15:02** But what about what you have got going on?

**01:15:04** Is there anything else we can use to just date this episode even more?

**01:15:07** Because it's the best thing to do with an episode at a time.

**01:15:10** No, no, no.

**01:15:13** You've given up.

**01:15:14** That's it for you.

**01:15:17** I don't I don't want to.

**01:15:20** I've I've I've I have never been more over projects than than the thing that I'm finishing up right now.

**01:15:32** OK, for listeners in the future, they will know that this video, from my perspective, is going up in three days.

**01:15:42** Come hell or high water.

**01:15:44** OK, do not care.

**01:15:45** Right. There's no choice.

**01:15:47** OK, I have I've picked poorly for the last several topics.

**01:15:54** And the thing that I'm just wrapping up is this this video about trying to track down where did a poem come from?

**01:16:05** And this is sort of like a.

**01:16:09** A follow up or like a parallel video to the one that I did about the origin of the name Tiffany.

**01:16:14** And this this is a little bit like I know I guess like a spin off video of like here's a related thing.

**01:16:19** It's not really the main thing, but I've watched it or at least a version of it.

**01:16:23** And it felt like an expanded entertainment focused behind the scenes video.

**01:16:29** Yeah. Yeah.

**01:16:31** So this is part of the problem with this project.

**01:16:33** Like it's one of the reasons why I've just been very unhappy with this because it's like, OK,

**01:16:39** so I created when I do a main video, I now do these directors commentaries

**01:16:44** for the more complicated ones where I can talk about a bunch of the behind the scenes stuff.

**01:16:48** And I originally thought that, OK, well, there ended up being this

**01:16:54** interesting thing trying to track down where did this one poem that mentions this name come from?

**01:17:02** And I was like, oh, I should probably talk about that in the director's commentary.

**01:17:04** This is perfect. But I realized like it's just too complicated of a story to try to be able to tell off the cuff.

**01:17:12** Like even if I were to try to describe it to someone now, you know, like when you're doing a bad job telling a story and you go like, oh, no, wait.

**01:17:20** But there's this part. This happened before like that happened later.

**01:17:23** It's very hard to do.

**01:17:25** So like an idiot, I told myself what I'll just do is I'm just going to make a casual video where I talk through.

**01:17:36** Here's a more complicated behind the scenes bit about the research.

**01:17:40** And of course, I say like an idiot because.

**01:17:44** I'm not really capable of writing things casually.

**01:17:46** Like it's it's very rare that I'm actually able to do it.

**01:17:50** And so it just morphed and morphed and morphed over into this.

**01:17:55** From my perspective.

**01:17:58** Horrible Frankenstein's monster of is this a video that's just like casual extra information behind the scenes or is this a main video?

**01:18:09** And it's kind of neither.

**01:18:10** And I hate it.

**01:18:11** It's like feature length for you.

**01:18:13** It's like 20 minutes long, right?

**01:18:15** Yeah, I'm going to I'm trying to get that as close to 15 as I can.

**01:18:19** But yeah, the current cut is like 18 and a half minutes, which is I think it's the second longest thing I've ever made.

**01:18:25** I mean, you know me, though, like I liked this more than the name video.

**01:18:31** Oh, OK, that's that's OK.

**01:18:33** So I haven't heard you say anything about it.

**01:18:35** But yeah, I think if you just realize this is your feedback.

**01:18:38** I like it. I like this one more.

**01:18:40** This is more my thing.

**01:18:41** This type of like, you know, I love it when you get worked up, right?

**01:18:47** You get real worked up in this one.

**01:18:49** And I really enjoy the mix of you and the animation.

**01:18:56** There's a lot of like backwards and forwards like you're going out and like tracking down the information in these incredibly old books.

**01:19:02** Like I like it.

**01:19:03** It's interesting to hear.

**01:19:05** I like I have no perspective on this project.

**01:19:06** I kind of just assuming that it's going to really bomb on the channel like, oh, maybe the like the core audience will really love this kind of thing.

**01:19:15** But I understand that feeling.

**01:19:17** It doesn't have the thing because it's about a thing.

**01:19:23** It's not the thing. Yeah, exactly.

**01:19:25** Yeah, I understand. This depends on it depends on two things.

**01:19:28** You've watched the main video and you're also a viewer who has some sense of who I am,

**01:19:35** which like as we've talked about, I think quite easily 80 percent of the audience of my YouTube videos doesn't really have a sense of who I am as a person or like even that there is a person behind these videos.

**01:19:46** So I think it just has two brutal strikes against it right from the start.

**01:19:51** So I wouldn't be surprised if this ends up being one of the real bombs off the channel and really struggles in terms of numbers for something that's animated.

**01:19:59** We'll see. But it is also just like I've totally lost perspective.

**01:20:02** I think there is no other time other than like the end of quarantine where this video would have happened.

**01:20:08** And I feel like I feel like this has some real going crazy and quarantine vibes in it.

**01:20:15** I just spent so much time on this thing and it's awful.

**01:20:23** Well, this is kind of the perfect video for this episode because

**01:20:30** you're not sure about it and you don't think it's going to do well.

**01:20:34** And by the time this episode comes out, people will already know the answer to that question.

**01:20:38** Perfect. Yeah, exactly.

**01:20:40** People will know as it is currently, I mean, I'm in the stage where it's this frustrating stage where the video is assembled enough that I can show people like I could send you a link and be like, oh, hey, here's a preview of the video.

**01:20:54** And most people I know go, oh, great.

**01:20:57** Like when are you going to put it up?

**01:20:58** You should just put it up right now.

**01:21:00** And I go, no, no, I have I have three or four more days of making a thousand tiny changes that to this thing.

**01:21:09** And I will say it to you right now.

**01:21:10** I don't know why you don't just put it up right now.

**01:21:12** Like this. I don't see any reason why you wouldn't put it up right now.

**01:21:16** That's what everybody says. But Mike, you don't understand all of the changes I have to make.

**01:21:19** And there's just a sea of changes.

**01:21:22** No one's ever does like it.

**01:21:26** All all joking aside, there will probably be.

**01:21:30** I mean, considering very small things, but like 400 changes between now and when I actually publish it in terms of like tiny little things to adjust.

**01:21:37** Well, look, as somebody who shares editing projects with you, I'm not surprised about that.

**01:21:42** Yeah, I see some of the things that you tweak.

**01:21:46** You didn't need to do that.

**01:21:49** But I did, Mike. I didn't need to do that.

**01:21:51** None of them. I can assure you that breath is in the right place before.

**01:21:54** No, it wasn't in the right place before.

**01:21:57** You've done this to me, though.

**01:21:58** What do you mean? This? Oh, I've infected you.

**01:22:01** Yeah, because this leaks out into all my it's why I have to edit less now

**01:22:07** because I just cannot edit.

**01:22:11** The same way that I used to.

**01:22:13** Yeah, I know matter what I tell myself, if I'm getting into it, it's not going to be quick.

**01:22:17** And this is what I mean by like an idiot.

**01:22:20** I thought, oh, I'm just going to casually explain this complicated thing

**01:22:25** and somehow thought, oh, I really thought, oh, I can sit down over the space of a couple of days

**01:22:31** and just write a rough script and then just and then just record it.

**01:22:35** And I don't have to don't have to be really complicated about it.

**01:22:38** Like I have done this sometimes, but it's just very rare.

**01:22:43** And this was the wrong topic for it because there's just so many things involved.

**01:22:47** It's like, dude, you should have known you were going to do like a hundred drafts on this thing.

**01:22:50** And I know I say this a lot, but it does feel like this is just a terrible use of my time.

**01:22:56** But I also I'm like.

**01:22:59** When it will be up, I'll be happy because I really do feel like

**01:23:04** I'm going to be closing the door on this weird end of quarantine time

**01:23:11** that has been miserable for me for a bunch of reasons.

**01:23:14** And this this even though I don't love this video, it does feel like, OK,

**01:23:21** goodbye, this period of time like this is over.

**01:23:24** I'm never going to think about these things again.

**01:23:28** So, yeah, anyway, that's the that's the video that's going to be

**01:23:32** that will have gone up by the time this cortex podcast goes up for sure.

**01:23:38** Definitely no doubt.

**01:23:40** Oh, no, there is no doubt.

**01:23:43** No doubt.

**01:23:45** You know, it's funny to me, really, as somebody who is so clearly very aware of themselves,

**01:23:53** it surprises me that you get surprised about how long this project's going to take.

**01:23:57** Yes. Yes, that is true.

**01:24:04** There isn't really an answer to this.

**01:24:06** It just is what it is.

**01:24:08** You know, it is what it is.

**01:24:09** It's interesting because I knew that I wanted to have something for early September

**01:24:13** because of the travel and just against psychologically if you make things,

**01:24:17** even though my channel isn't uploaded to super frequently,

**01:24:21** you just feel bad when it's been a while since you've uploaded a video.

**01:24:26** And I was looking into my end of the year plans and I thought, man,

**01:24:30** I know from experience that travel really impacts the ability to finish videos.

**01:24:35** Like I can still do quite a lot of writing work, but all of the stuff that needs to

**01:24:39** happen to finish the video just really at this point requires like I'm at my home

**01:24:45** office with my equipment and able to do a bunch of things.

**01:24:48** So I was like, if I don't get something out before I leave, I'm going to just feel

**01:24:54** really guilty and miserable the entire time that I'm traveling because then it will

**01:24:57** just have been too long.

**01:25:00** It'll be like two months since the last video went up.

**01:25:02** And then that can that can easily start to creep into three when you feel bad.

**01:25:06** And it's like, oh, no, I want to avoid that.

**01:25:08** So I knew that like come hell or high water, there's a video early September and.

**01:25:19** I also thought like, okay, I got to sit down and think about this.

**01:25:23** I've done a terrible job picking topics.

**01:25:25** And I think some of those topics in retrospect have properties to them, which are

**01:25:34** foreseeable in the future of like, Oh, okay.

**01:25:37** Stuff that involves ongoing legal situations with people who are alive.

**01:25:42** Don't be surprised if that's really messy or Oh, Hey history, you know, the topic

**01:25:49** that you hate because everything is uncertain.

**01:25:52** It's never going to be fast, buddy.

**01:25:54** It just isn't because you're incapable of reading a book that says something

**01:26:00** happened in the past without having to also find out where is the source for this claim.

**01:26:06** Like that's just something I can't do.

**01:26:08** And it's why I can't really read those books because it drives me crazy.

**01:26:11** I should have known this, but I just didn't.

**01:26:14** I like willfully sort of ignored this and plunged headfirst into these topics.

**01:26:20** But knowing that I was thinking about this and after the last main video went up, I

**01:26:26** thought, okay, what I'm going to try to do is I'm going to try to pick a topic.

**01:26:34** That I can reasonably bet will be done in a shorter amount of time.

**01:26:40** And if I'm thinking about it, if I'm very consciously selecting the topics, I know

**01:26:47** the properties that are helpful.

**01:26:49** These are things I've talked about before, like constrainness is a really useful

**01:26:54** property where like this topic can't spill over into other areas.

**01:26:59** There's some reason why it naturally fits into a little box, like the video about which

**01:27:07** planet is the closest is very constrained as a topic.

**01:27:11** The better boarding methods is like very constrained as a topic.

**01:27:15** And so I tried to pick something to work on that genuinely would be a fast and easy

**01:27:22** video that I could do in under a month.

**01:27:24** So I could have something early September.

**01:27:27** Now, the spoiler here is that I was wrong and I failed in that task, but this, like

**01:27:33** I've always talked about this idea of like trend lines are the thing that you want to

**01:27:37** focus on.

**01:27:38** You don't want to focus on success or failure as the metric, like which direction are

**01:27:42** you going in?

**01:27:44** And so the topic that I gave myself two weeks to write after the Tiffany video, I

**01:27:52** didn't finish it in that period of time, but it is also very clear, like this was way

**01:27:59** better in the right direction.

**01:28:01** This topic was, I mean, I could literally say one one hundredth the amount of work

**01:28:08** easily.

**01:28:09** I just still missed the mark of let me try to pick something that I think I can write in

**01:28:16** two weeks.

**01:28:17** And I was wrong, but I wasn't wrong by a lot.

**01:28:20** I think that would have actually been a month long project if I had spent all the time on

**01:28:25** it as opposed to this thing, which is a six month project that's going up right now.

**01:28:31** Oh, so there's another one that isn't done, but is better than what you're uploading about

**01:28:39** the poem.

**01:28:40** Yeah.

**01:28:40** So the poem project looking from like when did it originally start is six months from

**01:28:45** start to finish, where like what's the original version of this to it's getting uploaded.

**01:28:50** Okay.

**01:28:50** My original idea was like, oh, okay, I'm working on this thing in the poem, but I'll have it

**01:28:53** later in the year.

**01:28:54** I won't try to have it for September.

**01:28:56** So I was trying to pick a easier project to do before the poem for the beginning of

**01:29:02** September.

**01:29:03** And this and this is where I failed, but I'm still pleased because like the trend line is in

**01:29:07** the right direction.

**01:29:08** Like I did a much better job of picking something that was constrained and that wouldn't

**01:29:14** explode all over the place.

**01:29:16** It's just because of my requirement to put something up before I went traveling.

**01:29:21** Then after two weeks, I had to look at it and make the call and be like, okay, what is the

**01:29:26** probability that you'll be able to completely finish this by the beginning of September versus

**01:29:32** spending the next two weeks to finish this poem thing, even though in theory you want to

**01:29:37** upload it later in the year.

**01:29:38** And it's like, I had to make the call of like, if I want something for September, I've got to

**01:29:42** finish the poem.

**01:29:43** So all of this is just to say, I think, and I'm really, really going to focus on it for the

**01:29:49** next few videos.

**01:29:51** I think I can be better at picking projects that won't explode in every possible direction.

**01:30:00** If the trade off is like, I have to not just let 100 percent pure interest drive like, oh,

**01:30:08** which way is the wind blowing today?

**01:30:09** It's like, no, no, you've got to focus on like constrainedness, at least for a little while.

**01:30:17** I do like doing big, crazy projects, but two slash three in a row, particularly at this time of

**01:30:24** year, has really just killed me.

**01:30:26** So I've got to change things up for the next couple of months, at least.

**01:30:30** Seems like it could be incorporated into a theme there.

**01:30:33** I don't know.

**01:30:34** I don't know.

**01:30:34** We'll see, I suppose.

**01:30:35** Got a little bit of time left.

**01:30:37** We'll see.

**01:30:38** I have actually before we go today, one hashtag ask cortex question that I felt like would be the

**01:30:44** perfect time to ask.

**01:30:45** Okay.

**01:30:46** This comes from Hunter.

**01:30:48** When you fly, do you prefer the window or aisle seat?

**01:30:51** If you need to get up, would you want to be the one asking other people to get up or the one who's

**01:30:55** subject to the asks of others?

**01:30:58** Oh my God.

**01:30:59** I have literally changed planes, changed my entire flying schedule around the ability to get an aisle

**01:31:08** seat.

**01:31:09** Like for me, it is very close psychologically of if I have to have a window seat, I find it so

**01:31:19** uncomfortable.

**01:31:19** I will do almost anything to fly at a different time.

**01:31:22** Window seats.

**01:31:23** It's, it's awful.

**01:31:24** I cannot, I cannot deal with it.

**01:31:27** I have to be able to get up whenever I want and not be trapped in the window seat.

**01:31:33** I 100% agree with you.

**01:31:35** Yeah.

**01:31:36** Cause it's reasonable.

**01:31:37** I'm aisle all the way.

**01:31:38** I don't, if I'm in a window seat, I feel pretty claustrophobic.

**01:31:42** I feel like I'm trapped in.

**01:31:44** I have no problem being asked to move because also I never want to ask someone to move.

**01:31:51** So I don't mind being asked to move because then I don't need to ask anybody.

**01:31:56** Yeah.

**01:31:57** So I can and do plan travel around getting aisle seats.

**01:32:01** 100%.

**01:32:02** Very important.
