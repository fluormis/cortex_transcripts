# Cortex - 121: Travelling Confidence
**00:00:00** I am recording on the computer.

**00:00:02** I have two backup recordings going this time,

**00:00:05** and I have optimized my podcast recording situation

**00:00:09** for dog comfort.

**00:00:11** Excellent.

**00:00:11** Because Lucy is here,

**00:00:13** and she refused to sleep in her basket.

**00:00:16** Instead, she wants to sleep on my lap

**00:00:18** while I'm recording the podcast.

**00:00:20** So I had to change the whole setup.

**00:00:23** You frequently change yourself, dog comfort.

**00:00:26** Dogs come first.

**00:00:28** It feels like it has been a really, really long time

**00:00:32** since we've recorded a show

**00:00:34** the way we're recording a show today.

**00:00:35** Like honestly, like it feels like it wasn't even

**00:00:38** the same show that used to do what we're doing today.

**00:00:41** I know exactly what you're saying.

**00:00:42** It's like, oh, Mike, I talked to him a lifetime ago.

**00:00:48** It's amazing.

**00:00:50** Well, okay, we have that, which is like,

**00:00:51** it just feels like it's been forever

**00:00:53** since we recorded an episode.

**00:00:55** But I mean more that you're not at home.

**00:00:58** I'm in a whole different country.

**00:01:01** I'm in America at my parents' house.

**00:01:04** Am I a whole new person?

**00:01:06** Because it feels like the person I used to be,

**00:01:09** he only existed in one location.

**00:01:11** He never went anywhere.

**00:01:13** But the person I am now, the whole world is available.

**00:01:16** He can go places.

**00:01:18** He can see things.

**00:01:20** He can do things.

**00:01:22** What a novel concept.

**00:01:24** The previous person doing things.

**00:01:27** No, there was no doing things.

**00:01:28** There was staying at home.

**00:01:31** So yeah, it does feel like, wow,

**00:01:34** it sure has been a real thing

**00:01:36** since the last time we spoke to each other.

**00:01:38** So in our last episode, we were wondering

**00:01:41** if you were going to be able to make your various trips.

**00:01:45** And it seems like that you obviously have done it

**00:01:48** because you are in America now, you're with your parents.

**00:01:52** How was your travel experience?

**00:01:54** Yeah, it's one of these funny things

**00:01:56** where I know that previous me was quite concerned.

**00:02:04** I think we talked about betting on if I was going to be able

**00:02:08** to do all of my travel plans successfully.

**00:02:10** And I think I gave it 50, 50 odds.

**00:02:11** I don't remember.

**00:02:12** Because you were adding the complexity in, right?

**00:02:14** Because you were going from home

**00:02:16** and then you were going somewhere in Europe

**00:02:18** and then you were going back home again

**00:02:19** and then to America.

**00:02:20** Did you end up doing that by the way?

**00:02:22** Because I remember there was a conversation

**00:02:24** of whether you would just leave from location one.

**00:02:27** Did you go home again and leave?

**00:02:28** Yeah, so the plan was to go from London to Switzerland

**00:02:33** and then from Switzerland to North Carolina.

**00:02:36** But I was very concerned that travel complexities

**00:02:38** wouldn't allow that to happen.

**00:02:40** But from current me's perspective,

**00:02:42** it's a little bit like, oh, what was that guy worried about?

**00:02:45** Nothing was a problem.

**00:02:46** Like everything was really easy.

**00:02:49** And it's like, OK, it's travel, the way travel is,

**00:02:53** the way I remember travel.

**00:02:55** There's just one additional piece of paper

**00:02:58** that you need to get.

**00:02:59** And that's your COVID test results.

**00:03:02** And I had my test done.

**00:03:03** They both came through just fine.

**00:03:05** And at Heathrow Airport, they were very concerned

**00:03:09** to look and check and scan the piece of paper.

**00:03:11** And then they let me through and it was totally fine.

**00:03:13** And at Zurich Airport, literally no one ever

**00:03:17** looked at the test result.

**00:03:19** I never showed that document to anyone.

**00:03:22** And I just flew to America.

**00:03:24** So no problems whatsoever on the flying front.

**00:03:28** So you did go from Zurich to North Carolina.

**00:03:31** That was the final plan.

**00:03:33** That did happen.

**00:03:34** And the funny thing was no one checked the paperwork.

**00:03:36** I almost felt like I wanted to show the flight attendant

**00:03:39** on that flight like, oh, look at me.

**00:03:41** I have a test result.

**00:03:42** I did it.

**00:03:43** Nobody's checked it.

**00:03:44** I did it.

**00:03:45** Come on.

**00:03:46** That's my gold star.

**00:03:47** I had all these extra plans.

**00:03:48** I spent an extra day in Switzerland

**00:03:51** to make sure that I had enough time to take the test

**00:03:53** and get the result, but not fly out on the same day

**00:03:56** to do with the next day.

**00:03:57** So it was all for nothing.

**00:03:59** I didn't need to do any of that.

**00:04:00** So the travel could not have been smoother.

**00:04:03** And I was super surprised.

**00:04:05** But now I just feel like, oh, OK, great.

**00:04:07** So there's just one more piece of paper for travel.

**00:04:09** Travel is back on the menu.

**00:04:11** Great.

**00:04:11** This is the thing that you can do.

**00:04:13** So yeah, it was perfectly smooth.

**00:04:15** So you went straight back into your old way.

**00:04:17** Because when we traveled to Romania a few months ago,

**00:04:21** I noticed, because we were talking about on the show,

**00:04:23** that I had lost some of my traveling confidence

**00:04:27** because things were more complicated.

**00:04:30** But for you, it feels like you were just straight back

**00:04:33** into old gray mode.

**00:04:35** Yeah, I think it helped that I had the two flights.

**00:04:38** So on my flight out to Switzerland, I was a bit like,

**00:04:42** oh my god, everything, like, airports are so big.

**00:04:45** Am I agoraphobic now?

**00:04:46** I don't know.

**00:04:47** I did have that a little bit on the way out.

**00:04:49** But by the time I was on the way back, like, you know,

**00:04:52** it's a shock surprise.

**00:04:54** There's not many like Zurich to Raleigh direct flights.

**00:04:57** So I had to take a couple of flights

**00:04:59** to make it to North Carolina.

**00:05:01** But by that point, like, then I just felt totally normal.

**00:05:05** It's like, OK, I'm just on a plane for a while.

**00:05:07** This feels normal.

**00:05:10** Oh, I have to change it in airport

**00:05:11** and get on another plane.

**00:05:12** And it just feels totally normal.

**00:05:14** Yeah, I think by flight two, it's like, oh, I

**00:05:17** got my travel mojo right back.

**00:05:19** And no problems whatsoever.

**00:05:21** So yeah, I'm feeling great about it.

**00:05:23** Yeah, I was totally fine on the planes.

**00:05:26** The airports were complicated.

**00:05:28** Because there were more steps that we had to go through.

**00:05:32** Maybe that's going to change.

**00:05:33** We're hoping to take a vacation in like a month or so.

**00:05:37** And it will include, similar to you, like,

**00:05:40** a bunch of plane trips.

**00:05:42** It's not just a simple.

**00:05:44** You can just get on one, get off, and you're there.

**00:05:46** And maybe that will help kick me in a little bit.

**00:05:49** I really would like to not have regressed in that.

**00:05:53** Because I used to be such a nervous traveler.

**00:05:56** And I really just don't want that.

**00:05:59** I tell you, I have not got my packing situation

**00:06:02** under control.

**00:06:04** Like, we take a couple of like little weekend breaks

**00:06:06** in the last month or so.

**00:06:08** And my packing situation is just a nightmare.

**00:06:12** I'm pretty sure what I have to do to get that back

**00:06:15** under control again.

**00:06:16** I feel like I've forgotten how to pack.

**00:06:18** I'm completely with you there.

**00:06:21** I've been making a bunch of notes on this trip of all

**00:06:23** of the things that I forgot that I do need to bring.

**00:06:26** So that part of it, yes.

**00:06:28** Like, that's still more uncertain just

**00:06:29** because I'm out of the habit.

**00:06:30** But I feel like you and I have both

**00:06:32** gone through the same process with travel of like,

**00:06:34** starting as very nervous travelers,

**00:06:36** then doing it a bunch and feeling like, OK,

**00:06:39** now we're confident ha-ha business travelers,

**00:06:41** and then falling out of it during COVID.

**00:06:43** But I expect that you'll get back into it very quickly

**00:06:46** as well.

**00:06:46** Once you do another complicated travel situation,

**00:06:50** you'll go, oh, OK, this is fine.

**00:06:52** And then you can also start making all the notes

**00:06:54** for the things that you need.

**00:06:55** You're like, oh, right.

**00:06:57** I need a time machine drive.

**00:06:59** I need a little external drive because I can't have footage

**00:07:02** that I'm shooting in just one location

**00:07:04** because one location is non-location.

**00:07:06** But I just totally forgot.

**00:07:07** Like, oh, yeah, you need this thing with you.

**00:07:09** So I have a bunch of those little things.

**00:07:11** We might talk about this in a couple of months time,

**00:07:13** but I don't plan to ever travel the same amount that I used to.

**00:07:17** Oh, a couple of months time.

**00:07:19** Interesting.

**00:07:20** In a couple of months time.

**00:07:21** What's in a couple of months time?

**00:07:22** I have no idea.

**00:07:23** The end of the year.

**00:07:24** Grab a turn of the year.

**00:07:25** Oh, interesting.

**00:07:26** And so I just don't plan to do that anymore.

**00:07:30** You know, I will still, I expect,

**00:07:32** travel more than I have at certain points in my life,

**00:07:35** but not to the level of like, 10 trips a year or whatever

**00:07:38** it was that I was doing in 2018, 2019.

**00:07:41** Well, I look forward to hearing much more about that.

**00:07:44** So this trip, these trips, mostly like relaxation

**00:07:49** focused for you, right?

**00:07:50** How has that been?

**00:07:51** Am I right in assuming that?

**00:07:53** It's been kind of like get out of the usual flow,

**00:07:57** take a break in some ways kind of thing?

**00:07:58** I don't know.

**00:08:00** It's been a real mix.

**00:08:01** I wouldn't say it's a clear like one thing or the other.

**00:08:05** At the start of the year, I did say like,

**00:08:07** I'm going to see my parents and my family

**00:08:09** before the end of the year.

**00:08:10** Like I just don't care what happens.

**00:08:12** And so that was part of this trip.

**00:08:14** It's like, okay, it's September.

**00:08:17** Like if you're really gonna do this,

**00:08:19** you need to do this at some point.

**00:08:21** So that's part of what this was about.

**00:08:23** But part of it was also working.

**00:08:25** And so one of the things that I did is,

**00:08:28** the reason that I went to Switzerland is,

**00:08:31** that was actually a writer's retreat thing

**00:08:34** that I was doing with a couple of friends.

**00:08:38** I know, I know, it sounds so fancy.

**00:08:39** Did you wear a beret the whole time?

**00:08:41** Yes, I wore a beret and I was smoking a cigarette.

**00:08:45** I was looking into the mountains.

**00:08:47** Bonjour everyone.

**00:08:49** Yeah, I mean, it was in the French speaking part

**00:08:52** of Switzerland, which was hilarious.

**00:08:54** Good old French people always refusing to speak English,

**00:08:57** even when you know they can understand you perfectly well.

**00:09:00** It's like, oh, they're always holding up that stereotype.

**00:09:03** I always think, oh, that's not real.

**00:09:04** That's just a thing people think,

**00:09:05** but no, it's totally real.

**00:09:07** But yes, it was great.

**00:09:08** And it is a thing that, like I do work trips on my own,

**00:09:13** great occasions where I'm just doing

**00:09:15** it like a dedicated period of work.

**00:09:17** I've been lucky enough to be invited

**00:09:19** to some of these things with some people.

**00:09:21** And this is one that a couple of friends

**00:09:23** had been trying to arrange before the whole pandemic started.

**00:09:27** And then is one of these things that we just kept pushing back

**00:09:30** several months at a time for a year and a half,

**00:09:33** until finally all of our schedules lined up.

**00:09:35** So that experience is a really intense working experience

**00:09:41** that's hard to describe, because I feel like even on my own,

**00:09:45** when I do little great occasions to just write

**00:09:48** and I'm by myself, those experiences

**00:09:51** are often very draining and very focused times.

**00:09:57** But when you also have a few other people there

**00:10:00** who are there to do the same thing,

**00:10:03** and you're also kind of checking in with each other

**00:10:07** at the end of the day of like, hey,

**00:10:08** what did everybody get up to?

**00:10:10** It is really intensive.

**00:10:13** It's a really focused amount of work.

**00:10:15** And it was a great experience to, one,

**00:10:18** be able to travel to a different place,

**00:10:21** two, be able to see some friends who have been trying

**00:10:23** to meet up with for a long time, and then three,

**00:10:27** be in an environment where I have,

**00:10:29** what I think of as colleagues, and we're all there

**00:10:33** to do the same thing, which is get a lot of writing done

**00:10:36** in a short period of time.

**00:10:38** And so it basically got an entire script written in the,

**00:10:43** I don't remember exactly, like nine days I was there,

**00:10:47** which was pretty great.

**00:10:49** But it was very exhausting by the end of it.

**00:10:53** I was completely tapped out, just like no energy left,

**00:11:00** can't do anything, just got on a plane and flew to America.

**00:11:05** So yeah, that was the first part of the travel,

**00:11:09** which was very, very work intensive,

**00:11:12** like quite easily one of the most intensive,

**00:11:14** say 10 days of work that I'll do all year,

**00:11:17** partly because other people are there,

**00:11:20** and like we're checking in with each other,

**00:11:21** and we're all here to do the same thing.

**00:11:23** So it's very focused, very intense.

**00:11:26** I have some questions about this experience.

**00:11:28** Okay, what are your questions?

**00:11:29** Everybody's working on their own projects?

**00:11:32** Yeah, no one's working together.

**00:11:33** There isn't like a theme, like we're all gonna write

**00:11:37** a script about such and such topic?

**00:11:39** No, no, there's no theme.

**00:11:41** Okay, there's no structure to it.

**00:11:42** No, because also we're not all the same kinds of writers,

**00:11:46** like we're writing different sorts of things,

**00:11:48** so it doesn't make sense to say like,

**00:11:49** oh, we all have to write a script

**00:11:51** because not everybody is writing a script.

**00:11:53** So everybody has their own stuff that they're working on,

**00:11:55** and there's just like a very vague at the start of it,

**00:11:58** oh, okay, there's things we wanna try to accomplish.

**00:12:01** And so for me, it was,

**00:12:03** I wanted to try to take a script that was basically

**00:12:06** just barely started and bring it to completion by the end,

**00:12:09** and so I was able to do that.

**00:12:11** And other people had their own targets

**00:12:12** for things that they were working on.

**00:12:14** Right, and every day you're like checking in with each other,

**00:12:17** this is how much I did today.

**00:12:18** Do you set like, are their targets set in the day?

**00:12:21** Like I wanna get this far through,

**00:12:23** and then you talk about if you did that,

**00:12:24** or what does that look like?

**00:12:26** Yeah, some people did that.

**00:12:27** Some people had specific goals of like,

**00:12:29** oh, I need to hit a particular word count,

**00:12:31** or oh, I need to finish this particular section.

**00:12:34** I didn't do that because I never find,

**00:12:38** yeah, I just don't find the scale of a day

**00:12:41** makes a lot of sense for me.

**00:12:42** The scale of like the entire time I'm here

**00:12:45** makes much more sense to me.

**00:12:46** But so, yeah, just basically the very loose structure is

**00:12:51** everybody's working on their own during the day.

**00:12:54** Maybe we get together for fancy beret cigarette smoking

**00:12:58** breaks as we think about life in the mountains.

**00:13:02** Right, yes, exactly.

**00:13:03** Sacre bleu.

**00:13:04** We, yes, we, Sacre bleu,

**00:13:09** tre magnificente los montanos.

**00:13:13** Oh, geez.

**00:13:14** Okay.

**00:13:15** And so then the only rough structure is

**00:13:18** we have dinner together and talk about

**00:13:21** what we were up to and that's really the only set point.

**00:13:24** Yeah, it's just a useful environment because

**00:13:28** in many ways, the kind of job that I have,

**00:13:31** it's a very you're on your own kind of job.

**00:13:34** You're just reading about stuff

**00:13:37** and then you're trying to write things and summarize it.

**00:13:39** And it's like a very, very solo job.

**00:13:43** And it is useful sometimes to be able to bounce ideas

**00:13:47** off of colleagues.

**00:13:49** And it's particularly useful to be able to bounce ideas

**00:13:52** off of people who do similar work,

**00:13:55** but maybe in a slightly different way

**00:13:57** or a slightly different field.

**00:13:58** So you can get just a different take on things.

**00:14:00** So it's a very useful experience.

**00:14:03** And I always feel very lucky when I get invited

**00:14:06** to one of these kinds of things

**00:14:07** because it's, I've always found it really beneficial.

**00:14:10** Do you not like think about trying to find a way

**00:14:12** to keep that as an ongoing thing?

**00:14:14** Or do you think it can only work

**00:14:16** in these short breaks in person?

**00:14:18** For me, it only works in these short bursts.

**00:14:23** There's a lot of things that I find effective

**00:14:25** in much smaller doses that as ongoing things

**00:14:29** I just don't find effective.

**00:14:31** Probably like partly the novelty of the trip helps that.

**00:14:35** Yeah, so I think novelty is a big part of it.

**00:14:38** I can convince my brain to be super serious about it

**00:14:42** in a really constrained amount of time.

**00:14:45** It's like, okay, we have to be working

**00:14:46** at 100% no jokesies.

**00:14:50** That's also why it makes it more serious

**00:14:53** when you travel to a different spot.

**00:14:56** It's like, no, no, I'm very serious about this.

**00:14:58** Like I've taken time to go someplace.

**00:15:01** Why else would I be here

**00:15:03** if I wasn't actually getting the work done?

**00:15:05** Like if I wasn't gonna get the work done

**00:15:07** what was the fricking point in making this trip?

**00:15:09** Yes, exactly.

**00:15:10** And so I've tried at various times these kinds of,

**00:15:15** and just to be clear, I'm not knocking this.

**00:15:17** I'm just saying it doesn't work for me.

**00:15:19** The sort of thing where you try to,

**00:15:21** on a much more regular basis say like,

**00:15:22** oh, check in with people every other day

**00:15:26** or every week about what you've been doing.

**00:15:28** And I just find that I'm not able to maintain it

**00:15:33** over a long period of time.

**00:15:34** And my brain starts to, I don't know,

**00:15:37** just like not take it seriously anymore.

**00:15:39** And so it doesn't work.

**00:15:41** So yeah, it does sound like,

**00:15:43** oh, shouldn't you just do that all the time?

**00:15:45** It's like, no, it actually works so well

**00:15:48** precisely because it doesn't happen all the time.

**00:15:51** It's the same reason that it's like,

**00:15:53** oh, I take the gradations, I know, not recently,

**00:15:56** but like, on occasion I take them

**00:15:58** to go to an intense period of work.

**00:16:01** And it's always super productive

**00:16:03** because my brain takes it really seriously.

**00:16:05** But let's say I went somewhere new every week

**00:16:09** to try to always just be writing really intensely.

**00:16:12** I think that wouldn't last two weeks.

**00:16:14** I think by week three, I'd go, oh, this is dumb.

**00:16:17** It's quite reductive, right?

**00:16:18** Like, it's like me just saying,

**00:16:19** why don't you just work hard every week?

**00:16:22** What's your problem?

**00:16:23** Like, I understand why the question is so silly.

**00:16:27** It's on the face of it makes sense,

**00:16:31** but in actuality it's pretty silly, right?

**00:16:33** It's like, it's silly.

**00:16:34** No, like here's the thing,

**00:16:35** I don't think it's a silly question

**00:16:37** because this is part of knowing about yourself

**00:16:42** and so, like it's quite interesting,

**00:16:44** but like one of the people I was with,

**00:16:46** he does do the thing where he has someone

**00:16:49** to check in with him every day about what he's working on.

**00:16:53** And like, he finds that very effective.

**00:16:55** And this is where you have to figure out

**00:16:57** like what works for you.

**00:16:59** I just find like, that doesn't work for me.

**00:17:01** I become almost weirdly resentful

**00:17:04** of like having to check in with someone.

**00:17:06** It feels like, oh, am I in school?

**00:17:08** Is this homework?

**00:17:09** It just like, it completely doesn't work.

**00:17:11** You have to figure out what works for you in your own life.

**00:17:15** I think it's, this is also one of the reasons why

**00:17:18** it's very useful in these kinds of things

**00:17:20** to talk to other people about like,

**00:17:21** ooh, how do you write?

**00:17:22** How do you write?

**00:17:23** And you can sometimes pick up ideas and say,

**00:17:25** oh, that's something interesting I never thought of.

**00:17:27** Like, I'll give that a try and see if it works.

**00:17:30** And if it does, like it becomes part of your routine.

**00:17:32** And if it doesn't, it just doesn't.

**00:17:34** It's an interesting and valuable experience,

**00:17:36** but it's not something, you know,

**00:17:38** it's not something I could do every month.

**00:17:41** I think I would either die from exhaustion

**00:17:46** or it would just rapidly become completely ineffective.

**00:17:49** And my brain would just be like, we can't take it seriously.

**00:17:52** We're not here to work.

**00:17:54** We're on vacation in Switzerland.

**00:17:55** Like, no brain, no.

**00:17:58** That's not what we're doing at all.

**00:17:59** We have to write scripts, you know, to pay the bills,

**00:18:03** to be able to do these writing trips.

**00:18:05** Like you can't just wander off

**00:18:08** and think that this is a vacation.

**00:18:09** That's not what this is at all.

**00:18:10** So that's what would happen, I think,

**00:18:11** if it was more regular.

**00:18:12** Yeah, okay, that makes sense.

**00:18:14** So then from Switzerland, we went out to North Carolina.

**00:18:18** Was that war of, is this been more of a relaxing time?

**00:18:23** Well, so here's what I would say happened.

**00:18:26** I don't know if you remember, Mike,

**00:18:29** constant talk of the swamp of uncertainty

**00:18:31** that I was living in.

**00:18:32** Yep.

**00:18:33** I think in some ways, it worked out great

**00:18:37** to be able to do this writing trip with some friends.

**00:18:40** And in other ways, it was a terrible decision

**00:18:46** because after having the Sharks project,

**00:18:50** followed by the Tiffany project,

**00:18:53** and then immediately going into the most intense,

**00:18:57** you know, week, 10 days of work

**00:19:00** that I've had in a year and a half,

**00:19:03** I really was just, you know, I was like barely alive.

**00:19:07** When I got on that plane, it was brutally exhausting.

**00:19:11** Oh, it also doesn't help that the poem video

**00:19:14** that I was working on, one of my main goals

**00:19:17** with that thing was I was like,

**00:19:18** oh, I absolutely have to get this done

**00:19:21** before I go on the writing trip.

**00:19:23** Like I need to be completely done with that project.

**00:19:26** But guess what?

**00:19:27** It wasn't done.

**00:19:28** Like I didn't finish it in time.

**00:19:29** So the first few days I was there,

**00:19:31** I was really like just busting my butt

**00:19:34** trying to finish up the last few details

**00:19:37** on that poem video and get it done.

**00:19:39** And also I was like, oh, I need to film a thing at the end.

**00:19:43** And so some very sharp-eyed viewers did notice

**00:19:46** that those mountains are like,

**00:19:46** oh, those look like Swiss mountains.

**00:19:48** And guess what viewers?

**00:19:49** You're exactly correct at the end.

**00:19:50** Like those are mountains in Switzerland.

**00:19:51** That was funny for me

**00:19:53** because I watched the version without that at the end, right?

**00:19:57** And I remember we were sitting down one day

**00:20:01** and saying to Woody and Ela,

**00:20:02** did you wanna watch the new Grey video?

**00:20:05** And she said, oh yeah, let's watch it.

**00:20:06** So I was like, oh yeah, I'll watch it again.

**00:20:07** And then that happened.

**00:20:08** I was like, oh, you didn't finish it in time.

**00:20:10** Right, like I, cause I knew where you were.

**00:20:13** I knew where you were going.

**00:20:14** And I kind of maybe wasn't aware of the timelines.

**00:20:17** And it was just very funny to me.

**00:20:19** It's like, oh, you're still working on it.

**00:20:21** Yeah, it was really terrible.

**00:20:23** It was like just one of these combinations

**00:20:25** of like too many things went wrong.

**00:20:27** And also that project,

**00:20:30** like it would just take hours and hours

**00:20:32** to render on my computer.

**00:20:33** And so it's like, I just ran into these delays of it.

**00:20:36** It lasted until the trip to Switzerland.

**00:20:38** That video though did give us like one of the great

**00:20:42** out of time moments.

**00:20:44** So when I'm upset out of time, you're like,

**00:20:45** oh, I don't know this video feels like

**00:20:47** it's gonna be terrible.

**00:20:48** And it's got like 50% more views in the video it's about.

**00:20:51** Which is fantastic.

**00:20:52** Yeah, that is still a little confusing to me.

**00:20:56** That is a case where I was definitely very wrong

**00:20:59** in my prediction of how that video would do.

**00:21:01** I think it's the title.

**00:21:02** I think the title really helped someone dead

**00:21:04** ruin my life again.

**00:21:05** I think that title is really good.

**00:21:07** Like it's just a good title.

**00:21:09** But don't say that it makes me so sad.

**00:21:11** I know.

**00:21:12** I hate the title game on YouTube.

**00:21:14** Well, we both do.

**00:21:15** More Texans know that we both really hate that stuff,

**00:21:18** but it's just a genuinely good title.

**00:21:21** I don't really feel like it's a clickbaity title per se.

**00:21:24** It's just a good title for that video.

**00:21:27** And it's very representative of the content.

**00:21:30** Yeah, I don't think it's clickbait either

**00:21:31** because it is representative.

**00:21:33** But it still, it does make me sad that,

**00:21:35** oh, if I happen to have a worse title,

**00:21:37** I'm fairly certain my prediction of this video

**00:21:39** won't do very well would be more accurate.

**00:21:43** That makes me really sad in my heart.

**00:21:44** But you know, again, if you subscribe to more text,

**00:21:46** you can listen to me cry about how I don't like,

**00:21:48** yeah, you have to have clever titles for your videos.

**00:21:50** Like a big baby.

**00:21:51** Getmoretext.com.

**00:21:53** Getmoretext.com.

**00:21:55** But yeah, so like, this was part of the problem is like,

**00:21:58** I had two nightmare projects in a row,

**00:22:01** one of which split into two videos.

**00:22:04** The second video ended up being what, like, I don't know,

**00:22:06** a half an hour almost, it was like forever long.

**00:22:09** Feature length is how I keep describing it.

**00:22:11** Feature length video.

**00:22:14** Yeah, it's a feature length video.

**00:22:17** And then also my only goal in life was I have to finish

**00:22:20** this stupid poem video before I go on this writer's retreat.

**00:22:23** And I completely failed.

**00:22:25** And so then I was like, just rushing so hard to finish it

**00:22:30** on the writer's retreat.

**00:22:32** And you know, Mike, this is a thing that just never happens.

**00:22:36** Like when I finish a video, it is exhausting already.

**00:22:40** So I normally take a couple of days off.

**00:22:42** Like I just have to, but I'm in a situation where I'm like,

**00:22:46** no brain, boom, we got to like hit the ground running

**00:22:49** full speed tomorrow, because I've already lost a couple days

**00:22:53** of this like only happens once in a while trip

**00:22:56** that's super valuable.

**00:22:57** So I just went like straight into writing another video,

**00:23:00** which I never do, got to the end of the week,

**00:23:04** I had finished a script and then like this,

**00:23:06** so this is just to like give the listeners an understanding

**00:23:09** of like, I really mean it that when I got on that plane,

**00:23:12** I was like a dead man walking.

**00:23:15** I was just totally tapped out in a way that I,

**00:23:21** I just kept thinking about it.

**00:23:23** Like I think I haven't been that tapped out

**00:23:25** since I had the worst year of my life,

**00:23:28** which was my last year as a teacher,

**00:23:31** when I quit teaching to do YouTube full time.

**00:23:34** And like that year was really brutal.

**00:23:36** And I remember the same thing, like that summer,

**00:23:39** I was just so tapped out from trying to manage

**00:23:43** my teaching job and also trying to do enough videos

**00:23:46** to push the YouTube channel over the hill

**00:23:48** so it could be like a full time position.

**00:23:51** I'll never forget.

**00:23:52** That first summer, after I quit my teaching job

**00:23:55** and I'm like, I'm gonna be a full time YouTuber,

**00:23:57** but also I've totally killed myself

**00:23:59** to get in this position.

**00:24:00** So I just didn't do any work for a really long time.

**00:24:03** And I remember I happened to meet up with Vsauce that summer

**00:24:07** and he asked me, he goes like,

**00:24:08** oh, are you still doing YouTube

**00:24:10** or have you decided to quit that?

**00:24:12** And I was like, it was so crushing.

**00:24:14** Cause I'm like, no, I've literally just decided

**00:24:17** that I'm doing it full time.

**00:24:19** If you retired, I've only just started.

**00:24:23** Yeah, I've only just started.

**00:24:25** But I'm worried that I broke something in my brain

**00:24:29** trying to get to this position.

**00:24:30** To be fair though, that I guess has ended up,

**00:24:33** that interaction has set like an ongoing precedent

**00:24:37** throughout your career, right?

**00:24:39** Yeah, yeah, no.

**00:24:39** Has Grace stopped making videos?

**00:24:41** You know, like you have these periods every year or two.

**00:24:44** Is he done with that now?

**00:24:46** Yes, yeah.

**00:24:47** So like that was definitely foreshadowing

**00:24:49** of the shape of things to come, 100%.

**00:24:53** But I just, I never forget that.

**00:24:55** And like every time I see Vsauce,

**00:24:57** I always think of him going like, how did you say?

**00:24:59** Like, no, I just, I'm full time now actually.

**00:25:02** Thanks for asking.

**00:25:04** But yeah, so like, I've just,

**00:25:05** I was thinking about that a bunch this summer

**00:25:07** because I think that currently

**00:25:09** this is the longest period of time

**00:25:12** in which I have just done nothing work wise

**00:25:17** since I went full time.

**00:25:19** So like since 10 years ago,

**00:25:20** I don't think I've had a break this long.

**00:25:23** But it's also because for the same reason like last time,

**00:25:27** I think I've just, I had never been so tapped out

**00:25:32** from several projects

**00:25:34** and then a really intense working period previously.

**00:25:37** And here's the thing though,

**00:25:39** it's been great because when I got to North Carolina,

**00:25:43** I finally got to see my parents, see my family,

**00:25:46** see Lucy who's still sleeping on my lap right now,

**00:25:50** gently snoozing away.

**00:25:51** For the first few days,

**00:25:53** I had this little feeling of like,

**00:25:55** ooh, I should get to work soon.

**00:25:58** Like I really wanna, I finished this video script.

**00:26:01** I need to now get this video actually finished

**00:26:04** so I can have something up for the month of October.

**00:26:06** But I realized quite quickly,

**00:26:08** the way I've been thinking about it is like,

**00:26:10** I needed to give myself a special dispensation.

**00:26:13** It's fine.

**00:26:14** You haven't taken a long amount of time off

**00:26:18** in a really long time.

**00:26:20** You haven't seen your family in a really long time.

**00:26:24** Just go with it.

**00:26:26** Like just decide right now,

**00:26:29** this is always the key with things,

**00:26:30** decide right now you're not gonna feel guilty

**00:26:34** about not doing work for a while.

**00:26:37** It's okay.

**00:26:39** You've given yourself a special dispensation.

**00:26:42** And as always, eventually the time will come

**00:26:45** when you're not completely tapped out

**00:26:47** and you're recharged and you can get back to work.

**00:26:49** But in the meantime, it's like, be with your family.

**00:26:53** Pay a lot of attention to the dog.

**00:26:55** Do some interesting things and you haven't traveled,

**00:26:59** you haven't been anywhere.

**00:27:01** Just actually enjoy it.

**00:27:03** It's been basically a really glorious month to have

**00:27:08** after the completely miserable swamp of uncertainty

**00:27:12** and sharks and Tiffany and everything else.

**00:27:15** So I feel quite relieved that I made that decision

**00:27:20** right at the start and haven't just felt guilty.

**00:27:22** It's like, no, you need to do this every once in a while.

**00:27:25** And if there's any time it's legitimate

**00:27:29** to take a bunch of time off,

**00:27:31** it's when you're spending time with family

**00:27:34** you haven't seen in like a year and a half.

**00:27:36** So it's been great.

**00:27:38** I've been very relaxed.

**00:27:39** As you know, Mike, I've been just like taking some walks

**00:27:43** behind my parents' house as a terrifying swamp,

**00:27:46** but it has a lovely little boardwalk.

**00:27:47** And so you can just like walk around and relax

**00:27:50** and do nothing.

**00:27:52** And yeah, spend time with my parents,

**00:27:55** help my mom out with a year and a half's worth

**00:27:57** of tech questions that she has built up

**00:28:01** like a list of things to ask me.

**00:28:02** Great, that's what I'm gonna do.

**00:28:04** And it's been glorious.

**00:29:45** for the support of this show and Relay FM.

**00:29:48** So you posted a picture on Twitter

**00:29:51** of what I can only assume is a vast selection

**00:29:53** of Magic the Gathering cards.

**00:29:55** And I'm assuming a score thing, 30-30,

**00:29:58** or if that's not what this means.

**00:30:01** Can you explain what all of this is?

**00:30:04** Yeah, so one might wonder, they go,

**00:30:06** oh, so you've just been like hanging out

**00:30:09** with your parents for a month, like what can you possibly do?

**00:30:13** And the first thing is my mom always does build up

**00:30:16** a lot of questions about the computer between my visits.

**00:30:18** And so she did have a literal folder

**00:30:21** full of sticky notes of tech questions

**00:30:23** that we needed to work through.

**00:30:25** But one of the other things that did come up

**00:30:27** is my mom expressed a little bit of interest

**00:30:32** in learning how to play Magic the Gathering.

**00:30:36** So she had seen the stream that I did on my channel

**00:30:41** and she had heard us talk about the game on the show

**00:30:44** a few episodes ago.

**00:30:45** And she'd made some like just little comments

**00:30:48** that made it sound like, oh, she might be interested

**00:30:50** in trying to learn how to play the game.

**00:30:53** So I completely seized on this and decided,

**00:30:58** oh, great, I'm gonna take this on as a project.

**00:31:00** I'm gonna teach my mom Magic the Gathering.

**00:31:02** She seems interested.

**00:31:04** I also think she will totally love it.

**00:31:07** I took a picture at the end

**00:31:08** because I thought it was hilarious.

**00:31:09** But before I arrived in America, I thought,

**00:31:12** oh, okay, I'm gonna teach my mom this game.

**00:31:14** I need to order a bunch of cards.

**00:31:16** Oh, but also if I'm gonna teach her,

**00:31:18** we need some dice to keep track of things.

**00:31:20** Oh, and also we do need to have a scoreboard

**00:31:23** because that'll be easier than writing numbers down

**00:31:25** and it like gives people something to focus on.

**00:31:28** So I started ordering like a bunch of equipment

**00:31:30** and I didn't quite realize until I actually arrived

**00:31:33** in America how many little Amazon boxes full of Magic stuff

**00:31:36** were waiting for me on the other side.

**00:31:39** But anyway, it was very fun like opening it all up

**00:31:41** and getting out the cards.

**00:31:43** And it's been this interesting experience

**00:31:45** because the game is incredibly complicated

**00:31:51** and difficult to explain.

**00:31:53** I've had this interesting experience

**00:31:56** over the last several weeks, like teaching my mom,

**00:31:59** who by the way, has gotten very into it.

**00:32:02** Like she is super into the game now

**00:32:04** as I completely expected she would be.

**00:32:07** I'm sure it will surprise absolutely no one to hear

**00:32:10** that CGP Grey's mom is also a very obsessive kind of person

**00:32:16** who can really get absorbed endlessly

**00:32:18** in the details of a bunch of things.

**00:32:21** And so this is why I was looking at her and going like,

**00:32:23** oh, you'll totally love this.

**00:32:25** Like if I love this, you'll love this.

**00:32:27** But so even though I haven't been working

**00:32:31** in the sense of writing a script,

**00:32:33** I feel like I've had this incredible experience

**00:32:35** which is trying to explain

**00:32:40** this incredibly complicated game

**00:32:43** in a way to get someone else on board.

**00:32:47** And I keep thinking of this phrase

**00:32:50** of like it's been professionally useful to me

**00:32:53** because when I make a video

**00:32:55** and I'm trying to explain some idea, whatever it is,

**00:32:59** one of the main things that happens as you write a script

**00:33:02** where you're trying to explain something

**00:33:04** is you can make choices about simplification.

**00:33:09** Like how are you going to simplify an idea

**00:33:13** for the listener?

**00:33:14** When you research a topic,

**00:33:15** you end up knowing a ton about it.

**00:33:17** At least I think if you're doing a good job making a video,

**00:33:19** that's what you should be doing.

**00:33:21** You should have a deeper understanding

**00:33:22** that is conveyed in the actual video itself

**00:33:24** or whatever it is you're explaining.

**00:33:26** If you're teaching, you should understand the thing

**00:33:29** a level or two deeper

**00:33:31** than the level at which you're teaching it.

**00:33:33** So that always involves like simplification.

**00:33:36** You have to decide what parts of complexity

**00:33:40** are you going to skim over?

**00:33:42** So like that's something that occurs

**00:33:44** in my videos all the time.

**00:33:45** It's like I'm trying to simplify something down

**00:33:48** so that it's understandable more easily.

**00:33:52** But the problem with Magic the Gathering

**00:33:55** is that the fact that it is exactly this complicated

**00:33:58** is the whole thing.

**00:34:00** That's what the game is.

**00:34:02** Is like there's all of these complications.

**00:34:05** And so I can't actually decide to say,

**00:34:08** oh, we're going to ignore the difference

**00:34:10** between this and that.

**00:34:11** Because the difference between this and that is critical

**00:34:14** and it matters and it will be the reason

**00:34:16** why you win or lose.

**00:34:17** Or you go, oh, I'm just going to ignore

**00:34:19** that this thing exists.

**00:34:21** But you can't because tons of the cards

**00:34:24** will explicitly reference this thing exists.

**00:34:26** And so a person will go, what is that thing that exists?

**00:34:29** So I don't know, I've just found it like very interesting

**00:34:32** as a kind of problem or like a practice exercise

**00:34:37** in explaining something where you don't have the option

**00:34:41** to simplify and the thing is really, really complex.

**00:34:46** And I've never had the experience as an adult

**00:34:49** of trying to teach someone else magic.

**00:34:52** And I do just keep thinking, it's kind of a miracle

**00:34:55** that anyone learns to play the game

**00:34:58** because you kind of need someone to be like an evangelist

**00:35:02** and tell you like, okay, listen,

**00:35:03** this is going to take two weeks.

**00:35:06** This is unlike any other board game you've ever come across

**00:35:09** but I promise you it'll be worth it at the end

**00:35:12** but it will never seem worth it until three weeks from now

**00:35:17** where you've not only like learned how to play it

**00:35:19** but you've also been able to play it on your own a bunch

**00:35:22** and start to get a feel for it.

**00:35:24** So, hey, trust me, we're going to go

**00:35:26** on a three week journey together.

**00:35:28** And at the end, you'll love this thing, comma, hopefully.

**00:35:33** Sign me up.

**00:35:35** Mike, you're a very good friend of mine.

**00:35:37** I'm just going to say right now,

**00:35:38** there's no game on earth that is less for you

**00:35:41** than Magic the Gathering.

**00:35:43** Oh, do not get me wrong, my friend,

**00:35:45** I was being 10,000% sarcastic.

**00:35:48** I 100% already know this is not for me.

**00:35:53** I downloaded the video game version.

**00:35:56** Oh, no.

**00:35:56** And I just opened it and kind of closed it immediately.

**00:35:59** I just tell, I don't know why.

**00:36:02** I used to be like, no, this isn't for me.

**00:36:05** Just in general, card games, just like general card games,

**00:36:09** like I tend to just forget how to play them all the time.

**00:36:12** I'm not very good with like board games,

**00:36:14** like remembering the rules of board games.

**00:36:17** And it kind of just was like, no,

**00:36:18** I can see where this is going and me and this game

**00:36:21** are not going to get along very well.

**00:36:23** No, I think you wouldn't get along very well.

**00:36:25** I feel like I endlessly talk about it,

**00:36:27** but I also think it is a interesting problem space

**00:36:30** because one of the things that I realized,

**00:36:32** I'm like, oh my God, how do new players get into this?

**00:36:35** It's so hard.

**00:36:36** And I feel kind of lucky that,

**00:36:38** oh, I first learned this as a kid

**00:36:40** when it was a much simpler game.

**00:36:42** It's like, oh, they've added complexity over time.

**00:36:44** So when I jump back in, I go, yeah, yeah,

**00:36:47** but I know a bunch of this stuff.

**00:36:48** Like I remember the bones of it from when I was younger,

**00:36:51** but jumping in now, it's like, oh my God,

**00:36:52** there's so much to learn.

**00:36:54** And again, why it's so difficult to try to think about,

**00:36:59** like, oh, how do I explain it?

**00:37:00** How do I simplify things?

**00:37:02** Is because, oh, there's a ton of rules

**00:37:05** and literally every rule has an exception to it.

**00:37:08** That's part of the point.

**00:37:10** So you go, okay, all right,

**00:37:11** this is very complicated right to start with.

**00:37:14** But also there are tons of things that happen

**00:37:17** that like the way I've come to think about it is

**00:37:21** they're not in the game.

**00:37:23** They're just a thing that happens

**00:37:26** because this card says it should happen now.

**00:37:29** And it's like, oh my God,

**00:37:31** like how on earth do you explain this?

**00:37:33** And the thing that's been quite interesting to me

**00:37:36** is I can't stop my brain from working out,

**00:37:41** oh, how would I try to change this

**00:37:43** to make this friendlier for new players?

**00:37:45** And, oh, there's just a bunch of pattern matching

**00:37:48** that's taking place.

**00:37:50** And there are ways that you could try to explain that.

**00:37:53** So, oh, instead of having all of these things

**00:37:55** that can put players off like, oh, there's orcs

**00:37:58** and there's goblins and there's wizards

**00:38:00** and some people just don't like that kind of stuff.

**00:38:02** It's like you could explain all of this just using shapes.

**00:38:05** You could say, oh, this card, it's a square

**00:38:07** and this card is a circle and that one's a triangle.

**00:38:11** And you have another card that says,

**00:38:13** remove all triangles from the board.

**00:38:16** And like, oh, suddenly it's so much more understandable.

**00:38:19** That's just like, you're just matching patterns.

**00:38:21** You're matching these different words that are going on.

**00:38:23** But anyway, it's also just made me think a lot about

**00:38:28** what makes games fun.

**00:38:31** Like why is it that a game can be fun?

**00:38:34** And a big part of, I think what some people find fun

**00:38:40** about games, and I don't know if this is true for you,

**00:38:43** is it's not so much the game itself that's fun.

**00:38:47** It's the figuring out how to play the game part that's fun.

**00:38:52** Like at the beginning of the pandemic,

**00:38:55** my wife and I, we got the board game pandemic

**00:38:57** and we played it for a little while.

**00:38:59** Great idea.

**00:39:00** Did you say bad idea?

**00:39:02** I said great idea, but I mean bad idea.

**00:39:06** No, it was great.

**00:39:07** Have you played pandemic the board game?

**00:39:08** No, I've never played it.

**00:39:11** I think you might actually like pandemic.

**00:39:12** It might be fun.

**00:39:13** But so here's the thing.

**00:39:14** It's like, oh, we played it, but part of the fun for me

**00:39:17** is like learning how to play the game.

**00:39:19** And I go, oh, okay.

**00:39:21** But at a certain point, I feel like I've kind of solved it.

**00:39:25** It's like, oh, I know how to play this game.

**00:39:28** I've gotten reasonably good at it.

**00:39:31** And now suddenly the game just loses all interest

**00:39:34** and I just never want to play it again,

**00:39:35** which is exactly what happened with pandemic.

**00:39:38** And so my pitch for anyone listening is

**00:39:41** if you have this experience where you play games,

**00:39:45** but then at some point when you feel like you've figured out

**00:39:49** how to play the game and then you just lose interest,

**00:39:53** you actually don't really want to play it anymore

**00:39:55** once you know how to play.

**00:39:57** It's like magic is for you.

**00:40:00** And it's one of the reasons why I really wanted to pitch

**00:40:03** this to my mom of like, oh,

**00:40:05** she should totally get into this.

**00:40:06** She would love it because I've seen her do this same thing

**00:40:09** her whole life where she learns how to play a game.

**00:40:12** She kind of solves it and gets very good at it

**00:40:15** and then totally loses interest in it.

**00:40:17** But what you're saying is with magic,

**00:40:19** there's always something to learn.

**00:40:21** Yeah, it's completely impossible to master.

**00:40:23** And so like I taught my mom how to play Settlers of Catan

**00:40:27** a number of years ago.

**00:40:28** And you know, she used to play on the iPad.

**00:40:30** And then I think she basically became

**00:40:32** like a world-class player and never lost

**00:40:34** and got just totally bored and was like, oh, okay,

**00:40:36** I've solved Catan.

**00:40:37** There's nothing more here for me.

**00:40:38** And she put it away and never played it again.

**00:40:41** But the thing that makes magic different is that

**00:40:45** every three months they come out with new cards

**00:40:48** and the new cards change all of the rules

**00:40:50** and mix everything up.

**00:40:51** And so like, it's never ever done.

**00:40:55** If the thing that you think is fun about a game

**00:40:58** is figuring out the game, magic 100% is for you.

**00:41:03** But the flip side is, oh my God,

**00:41:06** is it the most complicated game in the world

**00:41:09** to explain to another person

**00:41:11** and to get another person into

**00:41:14** and to like get someone on board with.

**00:41:16** So there's a funny way in which

**00:41:19** even when I haven't been working,

**00:41:22** I can see that the part of my brain

**00:41:24** that does the thing which is my career in some ways,

**00:41:28** which is explaining things, how do you do it?

**00:41:31** How do you make it better?

**00:41:33** How would you want to change this language

**00:41:35** so that it's more comprehensible to a viewer?

**00:41:38** Like that part of my brain is on vacation,

**00:41:43** but it's also had this interesting toy

**00:41:46** to like play around with while it's recharging.

**00:41:50** And I'm very happy that I have successfully taught my mom

**00:41:54** how to play magic.

**00:41:55** And she is successfully working her way up the ladder,

**00:41:59** beating the new players now.

**00:42:00** And she's super happy about it.

**00:42:02** And it's one of those experiences

**00:42:04** where I see her in the morning and she's all bleary eyed

**00:42:07** because she stayed up until two in the morning,

**00:42:09** like playing game after game after game,

**00:42:11** trying to beat people on the ladder.

**00:42:13** And it's like, oh, fantastic, mission accomplished.

**00:42:16** Do you consider it a good thing

**00:42:17** that you can't turn that part of your brain off?

**00:42:20** What do you mean?

**00:42:22** Well, does it not ever make you feel like you can't

**00:42:25** like just relax because your brain's always looking

**00:42:27** for something to explain to someone?

**00:42:29** Well, I mean, yes.

**00:42:34** Here's the thing.

**00:42:35** Like I like to play games.

**00:42:39** I've always played video games and now I'm just like,

**00:42:43** magic is my life.

**00:42:44** The reason that I like that activity is because

**00:42:48** it's like the only time that I do feel

**00:42:51** like my brain actually is relaxed.

**00:42:56** So it's a different experience playing the game,

**00:42:59** not trying to explain anything.

**00:43:00** And I just mean this for any video game.

**00:43:02** Like it can be really absorbing,

**00:43:03** like I'm playing Factorio or Minecraft or anything.

**00:43:07** It's the only time it feels like my brain

**00:43:11** can just shut off entirely.

**00:43:14** That's part of the reason that video games

**00:43:16** have always been part of my life.

**00:43:17** And it's part of the reason why when I'm done with a video

**00:43:20** and I need to recharge, it's like,

**00:43:22** I'll just sit down and play a game for eight hours in a row

**00:43:27** and I will do nothing else.

**00:43:28** And it's like, it's completely quiet in my head

**00:43:31** and wow, how relaxing it is.

**00:43:33** So I use games to relax in that way.

**00:43:38** It's like, it's very hard to describe,

**00:43:39** but it's a way to be absorbed,

**00:43:44** to be pleasantly concentrating on something,

**00:43:48** but also in a way where it's just clear

**00:43:51** and straightforward and quiet.

**00:43:54** But yeah, in the rest of my life,

**00:43:55** I do feel like my brain is always chitter chattering away

**00:43:58** about how to explain something or, you know,

**00:44:01** I feel like, oh, my brain is very curious.

**00:44:03** What's this?

**00:44:04** What's that?

**00:44:05** What's that thing over there?

**00:44:06** Oh, how does that work?

**00:44:07** How does this go?

**00:44:08** Like that's always happening.

**00:44:10** But I also don't think I would have the kind of YouTube

**00:44:13** career that I currently have if I wasn't that sort of person.

**00:44:16** So I wouldn't want my brain to be any different.

**00:44:19** It's always gonna be that way.

**00:44:21** You've just found a way to turn that

**00:44:22** into what makes you money too.

**00:44:24** Yeah, well, it's like you figure out what are you good at

**00:44:28** and figuring out how things work

**00:44:31** and then simplifying them down

**00:44:33** is something that I'm pretty good at.

**00:44:36** And so obviously I didn't set out to do this on purpose,

**00:44:39** but it's the sort of thing where you just see like,

**00:44:42** oh, where are the skills that you're good at useful?

**00:44:47** Yeah, sure.

**00:44:48** Sometimes there are totally downsides

**00:44:50** to a brain that constantly is going like,

**00:44:52** wait, how does that work?

**00:44:53** How does this work?

**00:44:54** Why is that the case?

**00:44:56** When I'm talking to people,

**00:44:57** it can definitely be a downside sometimes where I'm like,

**00:45:00** oh, where did you hear that?

**00:45:01** How do you know that that's true?

**00:45:02** Why do you think that?

**00:45:03** Oh, if that was true,

**00:45:05** would that mean that this is true?

**00:45:06** Like that kind of stuff can totally get me in trouble

**00:45:08** in conversations with actual people

**00:45:10** where I think sometimes people feel

**00:45:12** like I'm interrogating them,

**00:45:13** but I don't really mean to.

**00:45:14** I'm just trying to follow through some of the things

**00:45:16** that are being said.

**00:45:18** So there are totally downsides,

**00:45:20** but yeah, it's games for me are the way to turn that off

**00:45:24** and to actually relax.

**00:45:26** But what I mean by this trip being really pleasant

**00:45:29** is I feel like I've had the best of both worlds

**00:45:32** that I have actually been able to relax and recharge

**00:45:36** for a big period of time.

**00:45:38** And also the explainer part of my brain

**00:45:41** hasn't been completely inactive.

**00:45:43** It's had a pleasant, difficult puzzle to work on

**00:45:48** during that time, which is also a like no stakes

**00:45:52** kind of puzzle of how would you explain

**00:45:54** this incredibly complicated thing

**00:45:56** and you're not allowed to simplify it

**00:45:59** because the complications are the whole point.

**00:46:01** So that's what's been going on.

**00:46:02** And it's been just a really fantastic month.

**00:46:05** Although I have just recently finally,

**00:46:08** finally gotten back into actual work.

**00:46:11** So again, like this period of time is now over.

**00:46:14** It's been great.

**00:46:18** It is true.

**00:46:19** Actually, I told my parents, I was like,

**00:46:22** oh, can you please leave the house while I'm recording?

**00:46:25** Because now I actually need to work today.

**00:46:30** Work is back, Mike is here.

**00:46:33** CortexMerch.com.

**00:46:36** Subtlety is back.

**00:46:38** I think we've maybe decided this is a product

**00:46:40** that gets a once a year release.

**00:46:42** I feel like that that works pretty well.

**00:46:44** I know that people love the subtlety.

**00:46:46** I always want more subtleties and sweaters

**00:46:49** because I wear them a lot.

**00:46:51** I am surprised how much I wear my own subtleties.

**00:46:53** Yes, I'm actually looking at my subtleties

**00:46:55** and going, I need more of these.

**00:46:57** So Mike needs to bring them back.

**00:46:59** This is one of those things where I think

**00:47:01** we had a good idea and it keeps working.

**00:47:04** And I know people that I know that own them,

**00:47:06** they love them because they're really beautiful.

**00:47:08** Fantastic, very nice, very classy, very subtle.

**00:47:11** You know, it's just a t-shirt or a sweater

**00:47:13** with a little embroidered Cortex logo on the chest.

**00:47:16** It's fantastic.

**00:47:17** We have a two week pre-order going on right now.

**00:47:21** You have until November 10th to get your order in.

**00:47:24** We're bringing back all of the colors from last year.

**00:47:27** So previously it had just been blue.

**00:47:30** Then we brought in black and red options.

**00:47:32** This year we're bringing those three back

**00:47:35** and introducing a brand new color, green.

**00:47:38** So there is both a green sweatshirt and tee

**00:47:41** as there is blue, black and red ones.

**00:47:43** So there's lots of color choices.

**00:47:44** You could buy one, you could buy them all.

**00:47:46** I know I'm gonna get some more red and some green.

**00:47:49** That's what I'm gonna get this time for sure.

**00:47:51** I'm wearing my red sweater today and love it.

**00:47:53** You're wearing your red one today?

**00:47:54** My red subtlety is the shirt that I own

**00:47:58** that gets me the most comments of any shirt

**00:48:00** because people will literally tell me,

**00:48:02** oh my God, you're wearing a color.

**00:48:05** Like I've never seen you wear a color.

**00:48:07** I've never seen, I didn't know even though

**00:48:08** you own the red one, I've never seen you in the red one.

**00:48:10** I've seen you in the blue ones and the black ones.

**00:48:12** Yeah, I like the red one, but I'll tell you,

**00:48:14** everyone who knows me, they're shocked

**00:48:16** every time I wear the red.

**00:48:17** But like, oh, but I think it's a really nice red.

**00:48:19** I quite like it.

**00:48:19** But I'm also gonna add the green to my repertoire.

**00:48:21** I really like the color green for this subtlety.

**00:48:25** I think at least for me anyway,

**00:48:26** I'm gonna do the same thing I do every year,

**00:48:28** which is I'm gonna buy a bunch

**00:48:29** and then I'm gonna go six months from now.

**00:48:32** Oh, I don't think I actually quite bought enough.

**00:48:34** I need Mike to put them back on sale again.

**00:48:37** So here we are.

**00:48:38** Get your subtleties, people, they're great.

**00:50:50** Talking about great.

**00:50:51** Maybe I'm tipping my hand here.

**00:50:53** Brand new iPad mini.

**00:50:55** Oh, do you like it, Mike?

**00:50:56** Do you have an opinion on the iPad mini?

**00:50:57** Have you given away your opinion right at the start?

**00:51:00** Do I love my iPad mini?

**00:51:02** So this has been out for like a month now.

**00:51:05** So the iPhone event, Apple unveiled an iPad mini,

**00:51:09** which by and large is very styled

**00:51:12** around the kind of newer iPad aesthetic.

**00:51:15** So like maybe closer to the iPad Air

**00:51:17** has touch ID, full screen,

**00:51:20** not no bezels, but much thinner bezels now.

**00:51:22** Nice and thin in a few different colorways.

**00:51:25** Supports the Apple Pencil,

**00:51:27** which is a thing that I think we spoke about on the show

**00:51:29** that we in the past that we thought would never happen.

**00:51:32** I think somebody sent me a clip of that

**00:51:34** at some point over the last couple of weeks,

**00:51:35** which is us believing that the Apple Pencil

**00:51:38** would never come to the iPad at this point.

**00:51:40** So sometime ago.

**00:51:41** And yeah, so we have a brand new design.

**00:51:43** You have one, right?

**00:51:45** You did get one?

**00:51:46** Well, okay, so no, I didn't get one.

**00:51:49** My wife ordered one that was delivered here

**00:51:53** to my parents' house.

**00:51:54** And so the box was just sitting there.

**00:51:56** And I had no intention of buying the iPad mini.

**00:52:00** Do you wanna know why, Mike?

**00:52:01** Why? It's so tiny.

**00:52:02** So teeny tiny.

**00:52:03** Like that screen, it feels like the screen

**00:52:06** is barely bigger than the big phone.

**00:52:10** Well, I don't think that's the case.

**00:52:11** I mean, in size, like when you look at it,

**00:52:14** like when they say like, oh, these are the sizes,

**00:52:16** I call surely that's not that much bigger,

**00:52:17** but it is a big difference.

**00:52:18** But for me, it's not even so much the screen size.

**00:52:21** Even on the iPad mini, you have iPad OS.

**00:52:23** So you're able to do more on that screen.

**00:52:27** I had no intention of getting the mini,

**00:52:29** but my mom did get a mini.

**00:52:31** And so I saw her using it and I thought,

**00:52:34** ooh, that looks interesting.

**00:52:37** And then somehow my wife's iPad box got opened

**00:52:42** and I installed my iCloud settings.

**00:52:46** I had one of my iPad backups.

**00:52:48** Can't get up.

**00:52:50** Onto my wife's iPad mini.

**00:52:52** You know, just to like, just try it out, just to see.

**00:52:56** You know what my actual critical test for the iPad mini was?

**00:52:59** Is it too small to play magic on?

**00:53:02** The answer is no, it's not too small to play magic on.

**00:53:05** And so I may have been using my wife's iPad mini

**00:53:11** quite intensively for the past couple of weeks.

**00:53:14** And I may certainly be ordering one for myself

**00:53:18** when I go back because I'm very surprised,

**00:53:21** but I like it.

**00:53:23** I like it quite a lot.

**00:53:24** It seems extra ridiculous

**00:53:27** when I put it next to my giant iPad Pro.

**00:53:30** But the thing that has been really interesting to me

**00:53:32** is realizing it's just a very nice notebook size.

**00:53:37** Like it's almost exactly the same pleasant size

**00:53:41** as our theme system journal.

**00:53:43** It's like, what a great little size

**00:53:45** for a little companion iPad.

**00:53:47** And yeah, I've been surprised by how much I like it.

**00:53:51** And I've been surprised by how much I find myself

**00:53:53** reaching for it over my giant iPad Pro.

**00:53:57** It's a real win as a product.

**00:53:59** I absolutely loathe the volume button placement,

**00:54:04** but other than that, I have no complaints

**00:54:06** for that iPad mini at all.

**00:54:07** Like it's such a great little device.

**00:54:09** Yeah, with that, with the volume button thing,

**00:54:11** I feel like they gave and took away at the same time.

**00:54:14** Because it's weird because it's at the top,

**00:54:15** but I don't know if you'd notice this,

**00:54:17** but the up and down changes by device orientation.

**00:54:21** Yeah, no, I have noticed that,

**00:54:22** but here's the thing that kills me.

**00:54:24** Yeah, okay, yeah, great idea.

**00:54:27** I have no problem with that.

**00:54:29** I get why they did it.

**00:54:30** It helps make the volume button placement less weird.

**00:54:32** But now it bothers me that my big iPad

**00:54:35** doesn't work that way, right?

**00:54:37** It's like, guys, this is a software thing.

**00:54:40** You should make all the volume buttons work this way

**00:54:42** so that the one on the top is-

**00:54:43** Yeah, it doesn't really make sense

**00:54:45** that just because you moved it to the top now,

**00:54:47** it doesn't make sense.

**00:54:48** Because the point is like,

**00:54:49** the buttons are always fixed

**00:54:51** and doesn't matter where they are,

**00:54:53** if you change where the iPad's oriented,

**00:54:56** the buttons will be in technically different order.

**00:54:59** So it should be everywhere.

**00:55:00** I don't know why this is just a thing for the iPad mini,

**00:55:04** but it is as of right now.

**00:55:05** They should do it on the phone too.

**00:55:06** Like if they make the decision

**00:55:08** that the button on top is always the up volume button,

**00:55:11** for the love of God, do it with all of your volume buttons.

**00:55:13** Don't do it with one of your volume buttons.

**00:55:16** It's a very strange decision.

**00:55:17** But that's kind of just how that's settled right now.

**00:55:20** The iPad mini now is, it's the only iPad I'm using.

**00:55:24** Okay, so you used to have just the regular size one, right?

**00:55:26** You didn't have the Pro.

**00:55:27** Well, no, I have both Pros.

**00:55:29** Oh, okay.

**00:55:30** So I had the big one.

**00:55:32** That was what I always had.

**00:55:33** It started with that.

**00:55:34** And then with the 11 inch,

**00:55:37** I kind of started to move away from it.

**00:55:39** And then once I kind of became big Mac boy again,

**00:55:45** I stopped using the 12.9 inch completely.

**00:55:48** And was just using the 11 inch iPad Pro,

**00:55:50** pretty much exclusively at home as my home computer.

**00:55:54** So I come at home, I'm doing things,

**00:55:55** no matter what it is, I'm gonna use my iPad for it.

**00:55:58** But now that has transitioned to the iPad mini,

**00:56:00** because by and large, what I'm doing when I'm at home

**00:56:04** is like content consumption stuff.

**00:56:07** And I feel like this iPad mini

**00:56:08** is like the best content consumption iPad

**00:56:11** that's ever been made.

**00:56:12** Like screen is just big enough for video.

**00:56:15** And it's so small that you can hold it

**00:56:17** really comfortably in one hand.

**00:56:19** And it's also whilst very small,

**00:56:22** especially when you have the keyboard up in landscape,

**00:56:26** you don't really get a lot of information on the screen.

**00:56:29** It's big enough that I can like respond to some email,

**00:56:32** check a couple of spreadsheet things.

**00:56:34** And I can't wait if I have to.

**00:56:35** And so I am actually now,

**00:56:38** I'm gonna be selling my big iPad, my 12.9.

**00:56:42** So just don't use it anymore.

**00:56:43** Okay, so it's really going.

**00:56:44** That size class for me is done now.

**00:56:47** The smaller iPad Pro, I do like that I have,

**00:56:50** I haven't decided that may go,

**00:56:52** but I've not made up my mind on that yet completely.

**00:56:55** Because the Magic Keyboard is such a fantastic tool.

**00:56:59** And being able to have an iPad with that keyboard

**00:57:03** right there is really great.

**00:57:05** I wish that there was some kind of solution

**00:57:07** for the iPad Mini, not an impossible task,

**00:57:09** but a very difficult one.

**00:57:12** Like what are you gonna do,

**00:57:12** a one handed Dvorak layout on that keyboard?

**00:57:14** I have used a iPad Mini keyboard before.

**00:57:20** So bridge keyboards,

**00:57:21** they used to make an iPad Mini keyboard and very small,

**00:57:24** but it could get the job done.

**00:57:26** Nevertheless, like so I'm not,

**00:57:28** I don't really know exactly what the iPad Pro will be

**00:57:31** for me in the future.

**00:57:32** Because the question mark that I keep having is like,

**00:57:35** they're not gonna update this Mini

**00:57:36** as much as they update an iPad Pro.

**00:57:38** And if I'm like, oh, I'm all Mini all the time,

**00:57:41** nothing's ever gonna change me,

**00:57:43** in four years time I'm gonna be really upset

**00:57:45** because they just haven't done anything with it.

**00:57:48** So I don't really know exactly what the future holds for me

**00:57:51** when it comes to the iPad.

**00:57:53** But right now, because this iPad Mini

**00:57:55** has all of the specs that I care about the most,

**00:57:58** like it's fast and it's capable,

**00:58:00** I can do anything I want with it.

**00:58:02** It really has just become like,

**00:58:04** this is the perfect iPad for what I'm using

**00:58:06** an iPad for now.

**00:58:09** I'm gonna recommend with the keyboard stuff.

**00:58:12** Like I think on the Mini it's way better

**00:58:14** to float the keyboard and use the little floating

**00:58:18** like iPhone style keyboard instead.

**00:58:20** The swipy guy, yeah, I've been doing that.

**00:58:22** I've been doing that more.

**00:58:23** I've been doing the split keyboard a bit too,

**00:58:25** but the floating one is the best one.

**00:58:27** Because you could still just use one thumb

**00:58:29** while you're holding it to do all of that.

**00:58:31** So that works pretty well.

**00:58:32** I have bumped into a few applications

**00:58:34** that don't handle that very well.

**00:58:36** I don't know why.

**00:58:37** I've had some stuff like since the iPad Mini come out

**00:58:39** where like there's been some weird like just UI things

**00:58:42** that have been going on,

**00:58:43** which is starting to get cleared up.

**00:58:44** But one of my favorite was the carrot weather widget.

**00:58:49** Like the widget shows you like a seven day forecast

**00:58:52** and it would show me Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Sunday.

**00:58:56** Because Thursday, Friday and Saturday will get cut off

**00:58:59** and that was very funny to me.

**00:59:01** Like just a couple of days would just get cut out

**00:59:03** of the widget.

**00:59:04** Because it is slightly different in size

**00:59:07** and all that kind of stuff.

**00:59:07** And so with these kinds of things,

**00:59:09** because they just drop them all of a sudden.

**00:59:11** Some developers.

**00:59:12** Yeah, this is always the case

**00:59:13** when Apple has a new screen size.

**00:59:15** You have to expect for the first month,

**00:59:16** there's a lot of like UI weirdness.

**00:59:19** Oh, the magic app isn't full screen.

**00:59:21** There's weird black bars on the side.

**00:59:23** It's like, right, because they had no idea this was coming.

**00:59:25** And yeah, I've definitely noticed a few other things

**00:59:28** that are a bit weird.

**00:59:30** The other thing that like this one reminded me

**00:59:32** that I totally forgot that I used to do

**00:59:35** is like that split keyboard where you can use two thumbs

**00:59:38** to type on either side of the screen.

**00:59:42** I find that a really comfortable input method.

**00:59:46** And I forgot that I used to with one of my very old minis

**00:59:50** sometimes take it out on a walk

**00:59:52** and use that double thumb split keyboard

**00:59:55** as a way to like write down ideas really quickly.

**00:59:58** And I've been doing that again,

**01:00:00** like as I've been taking little walks around here

**01:00:02** and I just love it as an input method.

**01:00:05** I find it just very pleasant.

**01:00:07** It's faster than on the phone with one thumb,

**01:00:10** but the device isn't so big that it like,

**01:00:13** I'm not gonna take my giant iPad Pro out for a walk

**01:00:16** and use like a split keyboard on either side.

**01:00:18** Like that's dumb.

**01:00:19** I just, I really like the size of it.

**01:00:21** And I also find with the cover and hallelujah,

**01:00:25** the flat sides, like when you fold that cover back

**01:00:28** and with the flat sides, it's so comfortable to hold.

**01:00:32** And I feel like I have such a solid grip on it

**01:00:35** that it is a thing that I can like take out

**01:00:38** for a little walk to the local coffee place

**01:00:40** and like have out while I'm walking and thinking

**01:00:43** and writing down some ideas.

**01:00:46** It really is just a fantastic little form size.

**01:00:48** I think they did such a good job with it.

**01:00:50** And I'm with you, Mike, like for whatever reason,

**01:00:53** Apple seems to not enjoy updating their small devices,

**01:00:57** but right now while it's new

**01:00:59** and it's still reasonably fast

**01:01:01** and can do all the modern things,

**01:01:03** like I think it's a fantastic little iPad.

**01:01:05** Maybe if we just convince all the cortexes to buy them,

**01:01:10** then maybe they will update more frequently

**01:01:12** because like we just need to become complete evangelists

**01:01:15** for the iPad mini now, which I have no problem being

**01:01:17** because it is an absolutely superb little device.

**01:01:21** I have the purple one with the cherry case

**01:01:24** and it's such a nice little pairing.

**01:01:26** And this thing's gonna like,

**01:01:29** one of the things that I've been struggling with

**01:01:30** when thinking about getting back into travel again is,

**01:01:34** I'm not going to want to have just an iPad with me anymore,

**01:01:39** which is what I was doing with some trips before.

**01:01:41** It was just an iPad.

**01:01:43** Like I'm now going to want to have a MacBook Pro with me,

**01:01:46** especially when we talk about the new MacBook Pros

**01:01:49** in a minute.

**01:01:51** All I'm gonna want is to have a MacBook Pro with me.

**01:01:54** And I was struggling about like,

**01:01:56** would I wanna bring an iPad?

**01:01:58** Like I really love my iPad for like everything I do

**01:02:03** when I'm stationary.

**01:02:05** Like when I'm at home, I barely use my phone.

**01:02:08** I use my iPad, like that's what I like.

**01:02:10** And if I'm on vacation, if I'm hanging out

**01:02:14** or we're in the room,

**01:02:15** I would wanna use an iPad for all of those things, right?

**01:02:18** Like when I'm not doing work,

**01:02:19** but I'm not on the go, like, you know,

**01:02:22** this is kind of the way that I like

**01:02:23** to consume content and media and stuff.

**01:02:27** And if I was gonna be bringing my iPad Pro,

**01:02:30** then that's like a big heavy thing

**01:02:33** because I'm gonna bring my iPad Pro,

**01:02:34** I'm gonna bring it in the Magic Keyboard because of course,

**01:02:36** and then it's like now I'm bringing two laptops with me.

**01:02:38** Of course, yes.

**01:02:39** Yeah, 100%, you're bringing two laptops.

**01:02:41** Yeah, and now with this little thing,

**01:02:43** it just can just be thrown in the bag

**01:02:45** in like the book pocket, not even in the laptop pocket.

**01:02:48** My tote bag has like a book pocket where I put my journal

**01:02:51** and this goes in with it, like,

**01:02:52** and it just feels like nothing.

**01:02:54** It doesn't feel like I'm bringing

**01:02:55** any additional weight with me.

**01:02:57** And it's just, it's made even that kind of equation

**01:03:01** way easier for me.

**01:03:02** We're like, it's a no brainer,

**01:03:03** I'll bring this iPad with me, it's no problem.

**01:03:05** I could just put it in my jacket pocket if I want to.

**01:03:08** You could put it in your jacket pocket.

**01:03:11** Oh, I put it in my pajama pocket if it's...

**01:03:15** That's an interesting question.

**01:03:16** I don't know if when I get my mini,

**01:03:18** if it's a thing that I'll bring on trips with me,

**01:03:21** but I will definitely be tempted.

**01:03:23** I think I won't because my perfect travel solution

**01:03:27** is I have the MacBook and I bring the big iPad Pro,

**01:03:32** because when I'm working, I use Sidecar

**01:03:35** to have the two screens for the computer,

**01:03:37** which is one of my favorite things Apple has ever done.

**01:03:42** Like, goddamn, is that an amazing feature.

**01:03:44** I mean, you could do it with the little one if you want,

**01:03:47** right, I don't know how good it's gonna be.

**01:03:49** You know, like I'm actually sitting here right now,

**01:03:51** I've never even tried,

**01:03:52** I don't even think I've ever seriously ever used Sidecar.

**01:03:56** Oh my God, Sidecar is the best mic.

**01:03:58** It's my favorite thing ever that's Apple.

**01:04:00** I have like tried it, but I've never like seriously used it.

**01:04:05** So how do you use it?

**01:04:06** Do you set it up as a separate monitor

**01:04:08** or is it like just for certain apps?

**01:04:11** Yeah, so like Sidecar allows it to function

**01:04:13** as a separate monitor.

**01:04:15** That's really all it is.

**01:04:16** It's like you plugged in an external display

**01:04:18** to your computer.

**01:04:19** And that's why like, you know, on my writing retreat,

**01:04:23** it's like I've got my laptop and I have the second monitor

**01:04:26** and that allows me, you know,

**01:04:28** without having to actually bring a second monitor

**01:04:32** to have a really great working setup

**01:04:34** where it's like I can have notes on one screen

**01:04:36** and a script on the other.

**01:04:37** And it's like, yeah, I know I can put them side by side

**01:04:41** on the same screen, but it is so much nicer.

**01:04:43** It's so much easier to be able to spread out

**01:04:45** across two screens.

**01:04:46** Like it really is like whatever engineers

**01:04:49** that Apple worked on Sidecar, like thank you.

**01:04:52** It is my favorite thing in years and years that Apple did.

**01:04:55** And like it allows me when traveling

**01:04:58** to just really get so much more out of these things.

**01:05:01** The only thing I'm always wondering is like,

**01:05:03** hey, could I connect more than one iPad to my laptop?

**01:05:07** Cause I would totally consider doing it with three.

**01:05:10** So I can have two screens on either side of my laptop

**01:05:13** when I'm working, but it would be amazing

**01:05:15** if I could do that with the mini.

**01:05:18** So do Sidecar to the big iPad

**01:05:20** and do Sidecar to the tiny iPad.

**01:05:22** I wouldn't be surprised if Sidecar doesn't actually work

**01:05:24** with the iPad mini.

**01:05:25** I wouldn't be surprised if they hard coded that in

**01:05:27** to be like, no.

**01:05:29** I got it running right now.

**01:05:30** Oh, it does work.

**01:05:31** Oh, that's interesting.

**01:05:32** Okay, I'll have to play it.

**01:05:33** Okay, look, it's like a little touch bar down here.

**01:05:35** What's going on?

**01:05:37** Cause I've got Safari open and it's showing me all the tabs

**01:05:39** like a touch bar.

**01:05:40** Yeah, Sidecar lets you have some little iOS style controls

**01:05:45** along the side of your second monitor.

**01:05:46** I turn all of those off because I just want to use it

**01:05:48** as a second monitor because I want to be able to use

**01:05:51** the keyboard on my laptop to just move between all

**01:05:53** of the windows and everything very quickly.

**01:05:55** I'm not going to touch the screen.

**01:05:57** All right, well, when we're done with this show,

**01:05:58** I'm going to have to go try Sidecar with my mini.

**01:06:01** I don't think it will be the same,

**01:06:03** but I'll be curious to give it a shot.

**01:06:04** Let me tell you, it works.

**01:06:06** It's tiny.

**01:06:07** Any app I'm putting on this,

**01:06:12** I have to significantly scale down in size,

**01:06:16** but I don't know.

**01:06:17** What do you put on the side?

**01:06:18** Like what are you putting on Sidecar?

**01:06:20** Like what are you putting on the display?

**01:06:21** So usually the way it works is I have like my script

**01:06:24** writing app on the main display,

**01:06:26** and then I have notes or Safari on the second display.

**01:06:30** And so that's how I'm using it to like divide up the screen.

**01:06:33** I think perhaps the only thing that Sidecar would be useful

**01:06:36** for the mini is to just run carrot weather in it,

**01:06:39** full screen so you have like a little display

**01:06:41** that shows you what the weather is.

**01:06:43** I think that's about what the mini size would be good for.

**01:06:46** I just put Slack there and like, you know,

**01:06:49** it's filling up the entire display or whatever,

**01:06:51** but it's all perfectly readable

**01:06:52** because the screen's so crisp.

**01:06:55** Yeah, I'll be curious to play with it.

**01:06:56** But it's just, I don't know, maybe like I just,

**01:06:58** I tend to have apps bigger than I need them

**01:07:02** maybe on the Mac in general

**01:07:03** because I have all the screen space, you know?

**01:07:06** But like I'm throwing things on there now

**01:07:08** and yeah, I have to resize them or whatever,

**01:07:10** but it works perfectly well.

**01:07:12** Interesting, I might play around with it some more.

**01:07:13** I think especially when I'm traveling,

**01:07:16** I might play around with Sidecar some more.

**01:07:17** It's not really something that I've used very much

**01:07:20** because, you know, like I have a 30 inch display

**01:07:24** for my laptop and so I just use that one.

**01:07:27** And for my iMac, I have, you know, the iMac is 21 inches

**01:07:31** and then I have another display on the side

**01:07:35** the Dell display that I was using

**01:07:36** when I was using a Mac Mini on this desk,

**01:07:38** I just turned it on its side so it's a portrait monitor

**01:07:41** and I have all of the recording tools just on that window.

**01:07:45** So like my audio hijack and Skype

**01:07:47** and all that kind of stuff is just on that monitor

**01:07:49** and it's just left alone and never touched.

**01:07:51** So, you know, I'm used to using maybe different displays,

**01:07:54** situations where, I don't know,

**01:07:56** I don't find myself working just from a laptop very much.

**01:07:58** So I haven't maybe felt the need to even think

**01:08:01** about what Sidecar would provide me.

**01:08:03** I love it, but it's also a side effect

**01:08:06** of I'm using the other full size one,

**01:08:08** which with my current laptop doubles the screen real estate

**01:08:12** and I just find really, really useful.

**01:08:14** Yeah, that is cool though.

**01:08:15** D cramps the writing environment of like,

**01:08:17** oh great, I've got more space here for notes and scripts.

**01:08:20** I don't have to flip back and forth

**01:08:21** between the two of them or I don't have to squeeze it

**01:08:23** so that either of them is half the single screen size.

**01:08:26** So I will, because of that, I will always be traveling

**01:08:29** with whatever the biggest iPad is that Apple makes.

**01:08:32** I mean, I'll just put a little asterisk on that

**01:08:34** in case they make like a table size one,

**01:08:35** I'm not gonna travel with that.

**01:08:36** The biggest one they currently make, I'm gonna have.

**01:08:39** But I could honestly find myself tempted

**01:08:41** to bring along the mini as well,

**01:08:44** precisely for what you're saying,

**01:08:45** because it feels like it's nothing to pack.

**01:08:48** Like why not have it, it's a great little size.

**01:08:52** And there's lots of situations where I could imagine

**01:08:55** just wanting to, especially when I'm traveling,

**01:08:57** for a light day, just go out with that mini

**01:09:00** and not take anything else.

**01:09:02** So I think I will be tempted to travel with it,

**01:09:05** even though it is somewhat ridiculous to be traveling

**01:09:07** with a laptop and two iPads.

**01:09:09** I don't think I could bring myself to that, honestly.

**01:09:12** I'll be tempted, I'll let you know.

**01:09:15** Next time I'm wrapping up all my packing,

**01:09:17** I'll let you know what I've decided to bring.

**01:11:17** So we had to move this episode because of the travel stuff.

**01:11:21** And then we moved it again.

**01:11:23** And then we moved it one more time

**01:11:26** because Apple had another event.

**01:11:28** And I felt very confident that we would want to talk

**01:11:31** about what was announced on that event.

**01:11:33** And we would have been recording just before it.

**01:11:36** And I felt like that I didn't want to make another episode

**01:11:38** out of time.

**01:11:39** Yeah, we didn't want to do two episodes out of time.

**01:11:42** It was also partly my fault.

**01:11:43** I don't know, maybe we'll talk about it in more text,

**01:11:45** but I did a little bit of like a trip within a trip.

**01:11:48** So I, as always am constantly causing my problems

**01:11:52** with the scheduling.

**01:11:53** So yeah, we bumped stuff back.

**01:11:54** But when you told me like,

**01:11:55** oh, there's going to be the MacBook Pro event maybe.

**01:11:59** And we were scheduled to record the day before.

**01:12:02** It's like, well, that just seems silly.

**01:12:04** Let's wait and see.

**01:12:05** And I don't want to tip my hand, Mike,

**01:12:08** by giving away my opinion right at the start.

**01:12:11** But it was great to wait for these MacBooks,

**01:12:14** which as far as I can tell

**01:12:15** have been delivered directly from heaven

**01:12:19** by angels to us to use on earth.

**01:12:22** Not that you want to tip your opinions of it too soon.

**01:12:27** They did it, man.

**01:12:28** They done did it, though, right?

**01:12:30** So we are recording just before we get them.

**01:12:34** Maybe by the time this episode's out, I might have mine.

**01:12:37** I kind of specked mine out in such a way

**01:12:39** that it's taking a little bit longer.

**01:12:41** Like I didn't just go with one of the default options.

**01:12:44** Like I made some choices.

**01:12:45** So it's kind of coming towards the end of next week for me,

**01:12:50** maybe the week after that.

**01:12:51** But these computers are just a scene

**01:12:55** in the greatest possible way.

**01:12:57** I'm so excited, man.

**01:12:58** I was very fortunate because I was out traveling

**01:13:01** and filming and doing a couple of things on the actual day.

**01:13:04** But I got back to my hotel room just in time.

**01:13:08** It was, again, it was perfect.

**01:13:09** Like the angels were guiding me to the exact perfect moment

**01:13:13** that I wanted to be at

**01:13:14** because when I turned on the Apple event,

**01:13:17** they literally just said like the one final word

**01:13:21** about their AirPods and then they're like,

**01:13:23** and now let's talk about the Macs.

**01:13:24** Great, I've arrived, perfect.

**01:13:27** And it was 30 minutes of glory.

**01:13:29** Like rarely have I been so happy at an Apple event

**01:13:34** for all of the stuff that they did with the laptops.

**01:13:37** And like, it just kept getting better and better.

**01:13:40** And like, I have been dying for an upgrade

**01:13:44** to my MacBook Pro.

**01:13:46** And it's like, man, they just,

**01:13:48** they delivered on every single mark.

**01:13:52** And, you know, I know a lot of professionals

**01:13:55** will talk about this sort of thing,

**01:13:56** but my experience in particular was, you know,

**01:14:00** that day I had been out, I had been filming something.

**01:14:04** I was driving, so I had two dash cams recording

**01:14:08** and I had another camera that was running in the car

**01:14:11** and I had like another camera that I was using.

**01:14:14** And you know what I got back to the hotel room with?

**01:14:17** Handfuls of SD cards that I needed to unload

**01:14:21** onto my current laptop.

**01:14:23** And so like when I'm watching this event and they said,

**01:14:26** oh, and we've put an SD card reader right in the laptop.

**01:14:29** I'm like, oh my God, thank you so much.

**01:14:34** Like no port could be more welcomely received by me

**01:14:39** than that right now in this moment

**01:14:41** when I've got a pile of these freaking things.

**01:14:44** And it's so annoying to use dongles and adapters

**01:14:47** to try to get it through.

**01:14:48** And they're always so much more flaky.

**01:14:50** Like that's just the most minor of things

**01:14:53** that they put an SD card in,

**01:14:54** but like I couldn't have been more primed

**01:14:58** to be thrilled at that, like one edition in that moment

**01:15:02** than I was.

**01:15:03** I was like, oh my God, please keep talking

**01:15:05** about these computers, tell me more.

**01:15:07** And boy, did they have more.

**01:15:09** Yeah, I think the whole ports thing is interesting

**01:15:11** because what they did with it really,

**01:15:14** they made a bunch of niches of people happy.

**01:15:18** And then someone like me who very rarely needs an SD card

**01:15:24** or a HDMI port, but I do need them, you know,

**01:15:28** maybe once a year, I'll need it or whatever.

**01:15:30** So it's like, they make people

**01:15:32** who really need it really happy.

**01:15:34** And then people like me, it's kind of like, okay, great.

**01:15:37** I know it's, I have it now.

**01:15:38** Like, you know, like I'm not like super excited about it.

**01:15:41** They could have just given me, honestly,

**01:15:43** I would have like probably preferred two more USB-C ports

**01:15:47** or thought about four ports than those to be, for me, right?

**01:15:50** Like why not?

**01:15:51** Basically everything I own now is either that

**01:15:54** or I've replaced cables.

**01:15:55** I've done that a lot.

**01:15:56** I have USB-B to USB-C connectors

**01:16:00** for some of my audio gear, right?

**01:16:01** So like just over time,

**01:16:02** I've been slowly changing them over anyway,

**01:16:05** but also I guess like most people,

**01:16:08** I've invested in docking solutions, you know?

**01:16:10** So like I'm not gonna change any of that.

**01:16:13** Like when I'm at my desk, I have a dock

**01:16:15** and it has all the ports that I need or whatever,

**01:16:17** which is awesome.

**01:16:17** But now I'm just pleased that they have done it

**01:16:20** for the people that need it.

**01:16:21** I totally agree with that.

**01:16:22** Like when they were talking about the HDMI port,

**01:16:24** I'm literally not even sure what that's for.

**01:16:26** Like I think that's for external displays or something.

**01:16:29** I'm not like-

**01:16:30** Displays, projectors in offices is a really big use case.

**01:16:34** You know, like you need to connect to a projector

**01:16:36** to do your presentation.

**01:16:37** Having a HDMI port is massively helpful

**01:16:40** for that kind of stuff.

**01:16:41** Oh, right.

**01:16:42** Okay, so I guess that's the replacement

**01:16:44** for like those old pin.

**01:16:46** Yeah, the VGA pin connectors.

**01:16:48** Oh, okay.

**01:16:48** All right.

**01:16:49** That makes sense then.

**01:16:50** But yeah, I thought like, oh, somebody somewhere

**01:16:52** is really happy about this HDMI port.

**01:16:54** And I'm really happy about the SD card slot.

**01:16:56** And this is what a pro machine should have

**01:16:59** is like these solutions for people.

**01:17:01** So yeah, back when I used to get really annoyed about USB-C,

**01:17:05** I did look into like a whole bunch of the limitations.

**01:17:08** And I do think the way the spec is for USB-C,

**01:17:11** I don't think we're ever really going to see

**01:17:14** more than four USB-C ports on a laptop,

**01:17:18** just because of the like power delivery requirements

**01:17:21** for those versions.

**01:17:23** So I think they are kind of always limited to four.

**01:17:27** Like I agree with you more USB-C ports would be great,

**01:17:30** but I think I have a better technical understanding

**01:17:33** of why nothing on the face of the earth

**01:17:36** has more than four USB-C ports,

**01:17:38** which is hugely frustrating,

**01:17:40** but at least I can now like accept it for what it is.

**01:17:43** I will say for me, technically I'm gaining one

**01:17:46** because my 13 inch MacBook Pro only has two USB-C ports.

**01:17:51** And so the new 14 has three and then MagSafe,

**01:17:55** which I'm pretty excited about coming back

**01:17:57** as a charging option,

**01:17:59** like MagSafe is a better charging connector than USB-C,

**01:18:04** like it's way nicer.

**01:18:06** And I like that they didn't create

**01:18:08** an integrated brick this time.

**01:18:09** Like it's just a cable, it's like USB-C on one end,

**01:18:13** MagSafe on the other end, that's pretty sweet.

**01:18:16** Yeah, I'm happy about that.

**01:18:17** Like while I am trying to very slowly

**01:18:20** convert everything in my life to USB-C

**01:18:22** and I want to limit the number of connectors that exist,

**01:18:25** MagSafe is the only one they could bring back

**01:18:28** that I'm happy to add to the list of things.

**01:18:32** Because again, especially while traveling,

**01:18:35** it is like, even right now, I'm in my parents'

**01:18:39** I'm in my parents' walk-in closet with a bunch of clothes

**01:18:42** to try to dampen the echo.

**01:18:44** So the recording is much better this time.

**01:18:46** But like when you're using your laptop on the road

**01:18:50** in a bunch of weird spots, like right now I have a USB-C wire

**01:18:54** that is just, it's under tension to reach the plug

**01:18:57** on the other side and it is just begging for me

**01:19:01** to trip over it and smash the laptop

**01:19:03** and mess up the recording gear.

**01:19:04** So like MagSafe is the one where like that additional

**01:19:08** feature of just breaking upon contact is really useful.

**01:19:13** And I have totally on the road,

**01:19:15** like had some real dicey moments of,

**01:19:18** oh God, the laptop's about to go flying.

**01:19:21** So I'm very happy to have that back as well.

**01:19:24** And it really does feel like a useful additional connector

**01:19:30** to have for people who are using the laptops

**01:19:33** in unusual situations where the probability

**01:19:36** of snagging the charging cord is way higher.

**01:19:40** So yeah, I'm very, very happy to bring that back.

**01:19:43** It is funny to call it MagSafe,

**01:19:46** like to have both products called MagSafe

**01:19:48** because there is no safe part in the phone.

**01:19:52** Like there's no safe.

**01:19:55** Like if you trip over a MagSafe connector attached to a phone,

**01:19:57** the phone is going with the connector.

**01:19:59** It's funny.

**01:20:00** I totally forgot that Apple called the other one MagSafe

**01:20:02** because yes, that doesn't make any sense at all.

**01:20:04** And I'm currently going to put that one

**01:20:08** as one of their weirdest connectors.

**01:20:10** I still feel like I don't really know what they're up to

**01:20:12** with that iPhone MagSafe connector, but whatever.

**01:20:16** It's just like wireless charging, but make it prettier.

**01:20:20** Yeah, it's wireless charging, but it's connected.

**01:20:22** I don't know.

**01:20:23** Like why can't I put that MagSafe connector

**01:20:25** on the back of my iPad mini?

**01:20:27** Shouldn't I be able to do that?

**01:20:28** No.

**01:20:29** I really wish they would have done that.

**01:20:30** That would be so sweet.

**01:20:31** At least I put USB-C on the iPad mini though.

**01:20:34** So, you know, it's not all bad.

**01:20:36** Yeah.

**01:20:37** Oh, let me just minorly complain about pro stuff as well.

**01:20:40** Let me tell you when you've shot several hours

**01:20:43** of HDR video footage on your new pro phone

**01:20:47** and you go to download that onto your computer

**01:20:50** over a lightning connector,

**01:20:52** boy, are you made aware of how slow lightning is

**01:20:56** for transferring big file sizes.

**01:20:59** I've never been more annoyed.

**01:21:00** I was like, God damn it guys.

**01:21:02** If you're gonna have a pro phone that's shooting files

**01:21:04** that are like 50 gigs in size,

**01:21:06** you should probably put a USB-C connector on your phone

**01:21:10** if you really want people to be using this

**01:21:12** for video production.

**01:21:13** But anyway, we're not complaining about the phones.

**01:21:15** We're talking about laptops from heaven,

**01:21:18** which are just fantastic.

**01:21:20** Like I think the other thing

**01:21:21** that I was really happy about is those processors

**01:21:24** that they put in there are totally nuts.

**01:21:28** Like the numbers that they were giving

**01:21:29** for the faster render times.

**01:21:32** Again, I could not have been more receptive to this

**01:21:35** because like I mentioned really quickly

**01:21:37** when I was working on that poem video,

**01:21:39** because that was an unusually long video

**01:21:41** and it also had an unusually large number of cuts

**01:21:44** and it was doing more complicated things

**01:21:46** like mixing in real footage

**01:21:48** with pre-rendered animation stuff.

**01:21:51** That took forever to render the final version

**01:21:55** on my computer.

**01:21:56** I think it was like four hours to render the final version

**01:22:00** of that thing at full quality.

**01:22:02** And these are laptops for professionals.

**01:22:04** I'm very glad to have this MacBook Pro.

**01:22:07** But Dan, like those four hours definitely meant like

**01:22:10** some days it was just too late

**01:22:12** to be able to upload the video anyway.

**01:22:14** So it would cost me a day

**01:22:16** and then I'd be working the next morning.

**01:22:18** So it's like, holy moly,

**01:22:19** if there's a laptop that can cut a five hour project

**01:22:22** down into a one hour project,

**01:22:24** it's like Tim Apple,

**01:22:26** you can't take my money fast enough to get that laptop.

**01:22:29** I just opened my wallet and I told him to reach in

**01:22:32** and take however much he wanted out

**01:22:34** and give me the fastest laptop they made.

**01:22:37** Because yeah, it really matters

**01:22:39** for rendering big complicated video projects.

**01:22:43** And that doesn't matter all the time,

**01:22:46** but when it's a problem,

**01:22:47** it can be a real critical problem

**01:22:49** and really delay a project.

**01:22:51** So I was just thrilled with that.

**01:22:53** They were talking about like these laptops

**01:22:55** with the M1 Pro or Max chips can render,

**01:22:58** I don't remember which one was probably the M1 Max,

**01:23:00** but can render a video faster than a Mac Pro

**01:23:04** with an afterburner card in it.

**01:23:05** Yeah, yeah.

**01:23:06** Which is just, that's obscene.

**01:23:08** I think people under appreciate

**01:23:11** how much Apple is quietly pushing

**01:23:14** into the entertainment industry on the production side.

**01:23:19** It's little things like this,

**01:23:21** like the reason that it can render that so much faster

**01:23:24** is because they designed part of the Max processor

**01:23:28** to specifically handle the ProRes format,

**01:23:31** which is what Final Cut uses when you're working on videos.

**01:23:36** You know, it's just like, this is all the stuff that I use.

**01:23:39** And so this is Apple at their best where it's like,

**01:23:42** if they control the whole stack,

**01:23:45** they've made Final Cut,

**01:23:46** which is the software you're using to make videos,

**01:23:48** they've helped design the video format

**01:23:51** that the program works in,

**01:23:53** and then they can also design the chip that it's running on

**01:23:57** to have hardware designed to accelerate just this part.

**01:24:02** Like that's why they're able

**01:24:04** to hit these totally crazy numbers.

**01:24:06** And I think anyone who works in the entertainment industry

**01:24:09** has to take notice at that kind of stuff

**01:24:12** because long render times are total killers for projects.

**01:24:17** And again, my videos are short and small.

**01:24:19** Like I know people who make longer videos,

**01:24:22** you know, and they have to, especially if they're traveling

**01:24:25** and they're just using a laptop,

**01:24:26** like they have to dedicate a whole day

**01:24:27** just to rendering out like a two hour video file.

**01:24:30** I remember that MKBHD would take an iMac Pro

**01:24:34** with him to events.

**01:24:35** Yeah.

**01:24:36** Because he used to try and use a laptop

**01:24:38** and it would mean he couldn't upload before he would leave

**01:24:42** because he's doing everything in like wild 8K

**01:24:45** and all that kind of stuff, you know?

**01:24:46** Yeah.

**01:24:47** And people hear something like that and they think it's crazy

**01:24:48** but this is also where like you have to think about it

**01:24:51** in a professional setting where, you know,

**01:24:53** the difference to MKBHD about being the first

**01:24:57** or the fifth to upload a video

**01:24:59** about a brand new technology product,

**01:25:01** like the difference to him is worth way more

**01:25:04** than like the cost of bringing that iMac Pro

**01:25:07** with him to render the files.

**01:25:10** It's just interesting.

**01:25:11** Like I look at what Apple is doing

**01:25:12** and I think they are really trying to take market share

**01:25:18** from Adobe with this key selling feature of like,

**01:25:23** but look how fast we can render out the final video project.

**01:25:28** Why do you think they're doing this?

**01:25:30** Because it just felt like they didn't care for a while.

**01:25:32** Like, do you have any kind of feeling on that?

**01:25:35** Like, I agree with what you're saying.

**01:25:36** Like they're building into the chips,

**01:25:39** like, which is really super interesting.

**01:25:42** The ability to handle all this stuff better,

**01:25:44** but like it feels like it can't be that many people.

**01:25:47** Like it's like an interesting thing to go

**01:25:49** to these kinds of levels for it.

**01:25:51** So here's my estimation.

**01:25:53** Again, just from like being a YouTuber,

**01:25:55** I'm on the edges of some people who work

**01:25:57** in the real entertainment industry, you know,

**01:26:00** on like big projects.

**01:26:04** And what I, my take on this is, yeah, you're right.

**01:26:07** This isn't a huge market in the sense of

**01:26:10** the laptop market is tiny compared to the iPhone market.

**01:26:14** And then I think when you're looking at people

**01:26:16** who work in professional video production,

**01:26:18** that is much smaller again than the laptop market.

**01:26:22** So it's not a huge number of people,

**01:26:24** but the budgets for big, proper professional

**01:26:29** like Hollywood and TV and Netflix productions, they're huge.

**01:26:35** And so what I think Apple is trying to go for here is

**01:26:39** the market is not big, but for those people,

**01:26:43** the cost of the hardware is a trivial part

**01:26:48** of the whole cost of the production.

**01:26:51** You know, so like you're, you're making a TV show.

**01:26:54** And even if we take a look at the Mac Pro and it's like,

**01:26:57** okay, you say you fully spec out a Mac Pro and it's 20 grand.

**01:27:01** That's like nothing in the budget for making a TV show

**01:27:05** for a streaming service.

**01:27:06** It's like a trivial cost compared to everything else.

**01:27:09** So I think Apple is pushing in this way because

**01:27:15** it's just a market for whom the cost of the product

**01:27:20** is almost irrelevant compared to their other costs.

**01:27:24** And also the computers that are rendering the final products

**01:27:29** are very frequently the bottleneck

**01:27:32** for lots of other things to happen.

**01:27:35** They're the bottlenecks for say being able to render a file

**01:27:40** of the production and process for one of the executive

**01:27:44** producers to watch.

**01:27:46** Cause you can't have him like watch your raw version,

**01:27:48** let think that you're editing, you need to render something

**01:27:50** for him to be able to see.

**01:27:52** And if you're working on like a big complicated thing,

**01:27:54** that's going to take a long time.

**01:27:55** You know, let alone, whenever you have a deadline

**01:27:57** for a TV series or a movie, it's like, boy,

**01:28:00** you better hit it and guess what?

**01:28:03** You know, like I know this from my own teeny tiny projects.

**01:28:06** After you render the file, you better watch it through

**01:28:09** all the way to make sure there wasn't

**01:28:11** a last minute mistake.

**01:28:12** And if you make a last minute mistake,

**01:28:14** you have to re-render the whole thing.

**01:28:17** And so as you get closer to whatever the deadline is,

**01:28:20** if you're working on something complicated

**01:28:22** and it takes a day and a half to render,

**01:28:25** and then there's an error after it's done

**01:28:28** and it takes another day and a half,

**01:28:29** like you can be in trouble real fast

**01:28:33** and there's huge amounts of money on the line

**01:28:36** for hitting, you know, production deadlines.

**01:28:39** So that's like, I don't know for sure,

**01:28:40** but that's my feeling about why is Apple pushing in this way

**01:28:45** is they've identified a market that has a problem

**01:28:49** they can totally solve because they control

**01:28:52** the complete stack and who is also willing to pay

**01:28:56** almost any amount of money to make this problem

**01:29:01** significantly better.

**01:29:02** So I would easily predict that these laptops,

**01:29:07** like it's their first go at doing this,

**01:29:10** but I expect when they come out with their next Mac Pro,

**01:29:14** with their new chips, the numbers that they're gonna be able

**01:29:18** to put up for rendering projects on Final Cut,

**01:29:21** I think those numbers are gonna be insane, right?

**01:29:25** They're gonna be able to say like,

**01:29:26** we can render a video file in 150 at the time, right?

**01:29:30** And that's where like those Mac Pros

**01:29:33** are not for normal people.

**01:29:36** I think everything the way Apple talked about

**01:29:38** their old Mac Pros, and I bet even more so for the next one,

**01:29:42** like no normal person should buy a Mac Pro.

**01:29:45** They are pitching this as a solution

**01:29:47** for the entertainment industry.

**01:29:49** I think that's gonna become even more so.

**01:29:52** What do you mean?

**01:29:53** You wanted a really powerful Mac.

**01:29:55** Oh man, I want the most power in my Macintosh,

**01:29:57** or like, oh, I make some YouTube videos every now and again.

**01:30:01** Like it's not my, it's like a side thing for me,

**01:30:04** but I wanna not waste time, or whatever.

**01:30:07** Like you get a Mac Pro, right?

**01:30:09** You're like, oh, I just like to own the fastest Mac

**01:30:12** I can own, I'll get a Mac Pro.

**01:30:14** I just don't think that many of those reasons

**01:30:16** are gonna exist anymore because the laptops

**01:30:19** are so incredibly powerful.

**01:30:21** The next iMac revisions are gonna be so incredibly powerful

**01:30:24** and that's before you even start getting to the Mac Pro.

**01:30:26** So like, I think it's gonna become

**01:30:28** even more edge of edge case.

**01:30:29** Right, I see what you're saying, yeah, yeah.

**01:30:31** Just as a little example, but you know,

**01:30:33** even if it's come up on this trip, it's like,

**01:30:35** oh, the new MacBook Pros, the display allows you

**01:30:40** to actually color grade properly to HDR footage.

**01:30:44** On the current MacBooks, you can kind of do it

**01:30:48** and you'll know it'll be mostly okay,

**01:30:50** but it's not actually gonna be the way

**01:30:53** that it really looks.

**01:30:54** It's like, oh, on the new ones,

**01:30:55** you can properly grade HDR footage to the right color.

**01:31:00** Why would they do that?

**01:31:01** Like, that's not a feature that basically anyone

**01:31:03** in the world cares about unless you're in video production

**01:31:06** and even there, you have to be in pretty high end

**01:31:09** video production to care about that.

**01:31:10** I do think that there is a certain type of buyer

**01:31:13** which includes me, which is like,

**01:31:14** I just like knowing I own a computer that can do that.

**01:31:17** Oh yeah, yeah, obviously there's a way

**01:31:19** that they can talk about it and it's just like,

**01:31:21** oh, it's cool to know that your computer now has

**01:31:23** a trillion to one contrast ratio.

**01:31:26** Like, they love being able to say those numbers.

**01:31:28** But I'm just saying, getting it to the point

**01:31:30** where it can color grade HDR footage is a very different

**01:31:35** and also very specific thing to hit that's different

**01:31:38** from just like, we made the colors even better.

**01:31:41** So I just feel like the messaging here is really like,

**01:31:45** it kind of reminds me of how ages ago,

**01:31:47** Apple really made a push into schools to be,

**01:31:51** in the education world.

**01:31:53** It just feels to me like they're trying to do that now,

**01:31:56** that they're trying to push into the entertainment

**01:31:59** production world.

**01:32:01** And I suspect like, Apple has a little bit of a problem

**01:32:05** if you compare Final Cut to Adobe software,

**01:32:08** which is, I've used both.

**01:32:10** I know lots of people who are familiar with both.

**01:32:13** I would say the general consensus is that Final Cut

**01:32:16** is much more pleasant to use,

**01:32:19** but it's a program that works best if you are an individual.

**01:32:23** You can use it in Teams,

**01:32:25** but it is a little bit more work to do that.

**01:32:27** Whereas Adobe is clearly designed

**01:32:30** as like a Teams first product.

**01:32:32** But I think like maybe what Apple's trying to go for here

**01:32:35** is they're trying to catch people like they did in education,

**01:32:39** where someone is at the start of their career

**01:32:43** in entertainment, maybe they're a person

**01:32:45** who has a YouTube channel and they're a one person show,

**01:32:48** or they're just an influencer who's like using their computer

**01:32:51** to put together videos.

**01:32:53** And as that person grows banking on,

**01:32:57** oh, they use Final Cuts and they got familiar with this

**01:33:00** and they're using a Mac.

**01:33:02** And then as these like new people get larger

**01:33:05** in the entertainment world,

**01:33:07** they're the ones since they like and use Final Cut

**01:33:10** who can enforce the like,

**01:33:11** okay, my little production company,

**01:33:12** we're gonna standardize on Final Cut.

**01:33:14** We're not gonna standardize on Adobe

**01:33:17** because it's what I know.

**01:33:18** I don't know if that's true, but that's kind of my guess

**01:33:21** is I feel like maybe they're trying to catch people

**01:33:23** at the start, get them familiar with Final Cut

**01:33:26** by having all of these huge advantages

**01:33:28** of like everyone knows if you're making videos,

**01:33:30** Final Cut on a Mac is huge and fast.

**01:33:34** And then, you know, standardize your small production house

**01:33:37** when you become successful around this product.

**01:33:39** And then when you're running a production house

**01:33:41** and you start dealing with much, much bigger budgets,

**01:33:44** you don't care at all about how much the new Mac Pro costs.

**01:33:47** You just want the fastest computer that can render it.

**01:33:49** So I don't know, I could be wrong,

**01:33:51** but that's kind of my guess about what Apple strategy is here.

**01:33:53** And I just feel like lots of things are pointing

**01:33:56** in that direction.

**01:33:57** And this new amazing Mac Book Pro feels to me

**01:34:00** like it has a lot of things pointing in that direction.

**01:34:03** All right, Gary, let's finish up on a hashtag

**01:34:05** ask cortex question for today.

**01:34:07** I have one for you from Eli.

**01:34:10** Eli wants to know, does Gray still listen

**01:34:13** to Girl Talks all day?

**01:34:15** I was just really listening to an old episode of the show

**01:34:17** and I had totally forgotten about this album.

**01:34:20** Yeah, actually, good timing for this question

**01:34:22** because my various I listen to songs on repeat go

**01:34:25** in and out of favor over the course of months and years.

**01:34:30** And Girl Talk all day had actually been really out of favor

**01:34:33** for a long time, but actually on this most recent writing trip,

**01:34:38** it came back in a big way.

**01:34:41** I listened to it just a ton.

**01:34:44** And I think it's not a coincidence.

**01:34:47** I think it happened precisely because like I just really 100%

**01:34:53** needed to get right back into writing when normally I would

**01:34:57** just collapse after a big video like the poem video.

**01:35:01** And so, yeah, it actually was the first thing I queued up

**01:35:04** like the morning after that poem video went out.

**01:35:06** It's like I got up.

**01:35:07** It's like, OK.

**01:35:09** All right, dude, time to get to work.

**01:35:11** And so I put on my headphones and I let up Girl Talk all day.

**01:35:14** And yeah, I hadn't listened to it in a really long time.

**01:35:17** But I will say, like, goddamn, I love that album.

**01:35:19** I think it is total genius.

**01:35:22** And I listened to it on repeat in the mountains of Switzerland

**01:35:27** probably 200 times.

**01:35:31** I haven't listened to it in a really long time.

**01:35:33** I don't know if it's something that like you just put on

**01:35:34** in the background or just.

**01:35:36** No, it's focused.

**01:35:37** To me, it feels so specific.

**01:35:39** Yeah, you've got to be like, I want to listen to this album now.

**01:35:44** Right.

**01:35:45** I don't think it's like you don't just like like for me,

**01:35:47** like one of the things that I was talking about around that time,

**01:35:49** I think was Taichou Taiko, T-Y-C-H-O.

**01:35:54** And I can put that on in both instances.

**01:35:57** I can put his music on when I'm just hanging out

**01:36:00** or I can put it on when I'm trying to focus for work.

**01:36:02** Like it works for both of those for me because it's more like

**01:36:06** it's got a good beat to it that can pump me up.

**01:36:09** But it also is pretty chill.

**01:36:11** Yeah, he was a great recommendation of yours.

**01:36:13** Like I've added a ton of stuff of his to my playlist.

**01:36:16** And he is on the board.

**01:36:18** He's like low fi chill hop adjacent kind of music.

**01:36:23** Yeah, it does it does hit both marks.

**01:36:25** Like you can have it as background music to just relax

**01:36:28** and you can also have it as music while you're working,

**01:36:30** which is it's a hard line to straddle for me.

**01:36:34** But he definitely does that.

**01:36:36** But the girl talk album is very much not background music.

**01:36:39** I feel like it's a lot more in your face.

**01:36:42** Yeah, that's the way to put it for sure.

**01:36:46** Have you tried out any of the spatial audio?

**01:36:48** Dolby Amos music that Apple music has?

**01:36:51** I don't know.

**01:36:52** I don't think I've listened to any of the spatial audio music.

**01:36:54** I've just listened to the spatial audio

**01:36:56** when watching TV sometimes, which is very odd.

**01:36:59** And I'm still, I'm still not sure about it.

**01:37:01** Like, I don't know why this audio needs to sound

**01:37:03** like it's coming out of my iPad.

**01:37:05** I would just prefer it to sound like amazing surround sound.

**01:37:08** The music is more that the music is more surround sound

**01:37:11** than coming from the phone or whatever.

**01:37:13** And it's kind of, that's how it's made to be.

**01:37:16** Like the music is meant to kind of like surround you.

**01:37:19** That's, you know, there's more of that.

**01:37:21** I don't know.

**01:37:21** I mean, maybe I have, I've said before,

**01:37:23** I feel like I have a real tin ear for music.

**01:37:27** I'm not a very musical person.

**01:37:28** And so it may be that I totally did listen to it

**01:37:31** and was just completely not aware.

**01:37:33** I wouldn't be surprised by that,

**01:37:35** but this is something like I've had this at home.

**01:37:37** I said to Adina like, oh, try this.

**01:37:38** She just doesn't hear it.

**01:37:40** And like, it's just different people reacting

**01:37:42** in different ways.

**01:37:43** Like I have friends who hate it and I really like it.

**01:37:47** You know, like, I think it's just,

**01:37:49** it's definitely a personal preference thing

**01:37:52** about how you relate to it.

**01:37:53** Mike, you send me some hip tracks.

**01:37:57** Awesome.

**01:37:58** And I'll give them a listen.

**01:37:59** All right, I'll find some hip tracks for you.

**01:38:01** I'll load them up at my turntable and tell you what I think.

**01:38:05** I'm gonna spin the wheels of steel.

**01:38:07** Sure, yes, that's exactly right.

**01:38:08** That's what I'm gonna do.

**01:38:09** Next time, State of the Apps for 2022.

**01:38:13** Oh my God, it's the end of the year almost, Mike.

**01:38:14** Nearly, yeah, we've got two more.

**01:38:16** All right, like we're moving into the busy period,

**01:38:20** I guess, from busy period to busy period.

**01:38:22** So State of the Apps 2022.

**01:38:24** So if you haven't listened to a State of the Apps episode

**01:38:27** before, I maybe recommend trying like the 2021 episode.

**01:38:31** We basically go through our devices

**01:38:34** and talk about all the services and applications

**01:38:36** that we enjoy using.

**01:38:38** I think we maybe will touch on some iOS 15 stuff,

**01:38:42** like the focus mode stuff.

**01:38:43** We might talk about that as part of the discussion

**01:38:46** for this one.

**01:38:47** So I will ask if anybody has any like app service system

**01:38:51** kind of related, like workflowy questions related

**01:38:54** to how we get our work done with the devices

**01:38:57** and apps that we use.

**01:38:58** You can send in some hashtag Ask Cortex questions for those.

**01:39:02** And we might pick some out to answer in the episode.

**01:39:05** And just before we go, don't forget to get your subtlety

**01:39:07** and subtle sweater.

**01:39:08** It's only available for two weeks.

**01:39:10** Go to clotexmerch.com.

**01:39:15** Puppy, I need to put you down.

**01:39:18** Sorry, Lucy's very heavy.
