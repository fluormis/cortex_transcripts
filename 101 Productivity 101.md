# Cortex - 101: Productivity 101
**00:00:00** I'm recording. I've got the backup recording going.

**00:00:02** Are you actually recording though?

**00:00:03** Okay. I'm literally, I'm looking at the recording.

**00:00:06** I see the waveform going up and down.

**00:00:08** Right, because I have had multiple occasions recently where you have said I'm recording,

**00:00:13** and I remember you saying I'm recording.

**00:00:15** But in the audio that I am provided by you, I never hear the words I'm recording.

**00:00:22** So are you recording?

**00:00:23** There's 100% chance that I'm recording.

**00:00:26** Although you can never be 100% sure, so I'll say 99% sure that I'm recording.

**00:00:31** Levels, levels.

**00:00:31** Levels, levels.

**00:00:33** I very frequently have people ask me, have you ever like spoke about why you use a to-do app,

**00:00:41** and what are the apps that you use?

**00:00:43** And my usual like inclination for that answer is like, yes, but like on 20 episodes of Cortex,

**00:00:49** like I have no one place that I could even start to imagine pointing you to.

**00:00:54** Right.

**00:00:55** It's easier now for like when someone says to me yearly themes, I know those episodes now,

**00:01:00** right? And like we've condensed it over time.

**00:01:02** So now on every yearly themes episode, we talk about the themes in the abstract a little bit

**00:01:08** before getting into the rest. Right.

**00:01:10** But what I thought of outside of the original set of episodes, and then some that's come since,

**00:01:17** there are some core parts of productivity, like to-do apps, email, time tracking,

**00:01:24** communication, and calendaring.

**00:01:26** These are things that we talk about all the time.

**00:01:29** They're very important.

**00:01:30** We talk about the apps that we use, but maybe not so much for a while have we spoken about

**00:01:37** why we do these things that we do.

**00:01:40** So I thought for episode 101, we could do productivity tools 101.

**00:01:46** I think you like that mainly because of how it works with the title, and I completely agree.

**00:01:50** It's two parts of it.

**00:01:51** I like how it works with a title and I'll never forget the episode to point people to.

**00:01:55** Yeah. That was your main pitch to me is like, look, I want to be able to have an episode when

**00:02:00** people ask, can you tell me about why you use these systems that you can point them to?

**00:02:05** And you're like, I'll never forget the number 101.

**00:02:08** So let's just make it that episode.

**00:02:10** And I completely agree.

**00:02:11** I think probably the one to start with is to-do systems because it is the core of productivity.

**00:02:18** Like it's the very central part is your task manager.

**00:02:23** So I was thinking about this earlier today and there is no one true way of being productive.

**00:02:31** Right. There's no one answer for everyone.

**00:02:33** There's no one system that's going to work for everyone.

**00:02:37** Like each person needs to pick and choose the parts that work for them and the parts

**00:02:41** that don't work for them.

**00:02:42** And this is the process of figuring out how to manage one's own life is finding the parts

**00:02:47** that work for you.

**00:02:49** And even though there isn't one true system, I think sometimes you can divide people up

**00:02:55** into a spectrum.

**00:02:57** And I think one of the biggest spectrums of how people manage their life is the spectrum of

**00:03:05** task manager and calendar.

**00:03:09** Some people are much more on like the calendar is primary and the task manager is secondary.

**00:03:14** And some people are more task manager is primary and calendar is secondary.

**00:03:19** I think both of us are pretty heavily on the task manager as foundational side.

**00:03:25** And so I think that like that's why we're going to start here because to both of us,

**00:03:30** I think it's sort of inconceivable of if you were taking someone whose life is disorganized

**00:03:36** and they're holding up this mess, which is their life.

**00:03:39** And they're saying, how do I get started trying to get all of this in shape?

**00:03:44** Both of us would say to do system.

**00:03:47** This is where you need to start.

**00:03:49** This is where it all begins.

**00:03:50** And I think part of the reason for me as to why I believe that strongly as I do is I think people

**00:03:57** that believe in the to do system as core still use calendars frequently.

**00:04:04** But from my experience of people that believe in calendars as the ruler,

**00:04:10** don't necessarily even use a task list of any kind.

**00:04:13** It's just everything goes on the calendar.

**00:04:17** Just in my experience of people that run in one of those ways,

**00:04:21** that kind of seems to be the way that things break down.

**00:04:23** Because I believe both are very important.

**00:04:26** And I wouldn't say equally important, but they, I believe are mutually important.

**00:04:32** Like you should use both because they need each other, I think, to be able to work effectively.

**00:04:38** But I, like you, believe that the to do system is the core of everything.

**00:04:43** Because one of the main things for me is I also am aware of myself enough that I know that

**00:04:49** no matter how many tasks I set for myself on a day, I won't always do them all.

**00:04:55** And one of the great things about a task list of any kind is that you have the ability to

**00:05:01** move stuff.

**00:05:02** You see that they're overdue.

**00:05:03** You didn't complete them.

**00:05:04** But with a calendar, by and large, it's gone once the day has passed.

**00:05:10** Unless you have a, I mean, unless you have a system of checking the previous days,

**00:05:14** but if you're doing that, then you really ought to be using a task list or to do system of some kind.

**00:05:21** Because at that point, that's the life that you're living.

**00:05:23** Yeah, I agree.

**00:05:25** Like, I think to try to really start at the foundation of this, of there was a long ago,

**00:05:32** long dead now version of gray who never used a to do system and floated through life,

**00:05:39** just like to do, you know, sometimes doing stuff and sometimes not doing stuff.

**00:05:44** And eventually he got to a point in life where he realized he could not manage all of the things

**00:05:50** that needed to get done.

**00:05:52** And it is so specific to me of exactly when that moment was when I was in teacher training

**00:05:58** school, and they gave me this enormous list of 100 plus things that all had to be completed

**00:06:05** in order to get your teacher certification.

**00:06:08** And I remember like, oh, no, like, I'm never going to be able to keep track of all of this,

**00:06:14** because some of them were really huge items.

**00:06:16** Some of them were really teeny tiny small ones.

**00:06:19** And I'm like, I'm never going to keep track of this.

**00:06:21** And so one of my very first versions of trying to figure out how am I going to actually get

**00:06:29** all of these things done was taking this huge list that the university gave me and turning it

**00:06:36** into a spreadsheet and trying to be like, OK, let me try to break this down in a way so that

**00:06:42** this is the list that the university is going to use to decide whether or not I become a teacher.

**00:06:49** But I need to turn this into a list that makes sense for me.

**00:06:53** Uh huh.

**00:06:54** Right.

**00:06:54** Like, this is a criteria that they have.

**00:06:56** Now let me make it into a selection of things that I need to have achieved.

**00:07:01** Yes.

**00:07:01** And even just like wording changes or what do these things mean in my own life?

**00:07:07** A to do system, if it's functioning well, this is part of the job that it does is it's like,

**00:07:14** it's your translation of what the external world is requiring of you and like getting it

**00:07:22** into a frame that makes sense for you.

**00:07:24** Everybody's brain is different and you just want to have stuff organized in a particular way.

**00:07:32** And so like that that was one of the very first times I was actually getting serious about trying

**00:07:37** to keep track because I knew like I knew me and I was like, I am going to totally fail if I just

**00:07:43** try to do this the way I've done school before of like, I'll remember most things.

**00:07:48** Right.

**00:07:49** And that's the other big part of it to do system is don't try to remember stuff.

**00:07:54** I think this can also be a very regular progression for people in life is that you're growing up

**00:08:02** and the world manages a lot of things for you and you can sort of get by by just remembering things.

**00:08:09** But like, again, at some point in life, usually past the point when you should have recognized

**00:08:16** it, you come to a stage where it's just like there's there's too many things to remember.

**00:08:21** You you cannot rely on your own brain to keep track of all the things that you need to know.

**00:08:28** And the penalties for forgetting things start to become real.

**00:08:31** Yes. Yes. They're not they're not pretend penalties like in school or they're like, oh,

**00:08:36** you're going to have a conversation with the teacher and they're going to be very upset with

**00:08:42** you. And it's like, OK, and then what? Well, then you go back to class. Right.

**00:08:48** Like, yeah, no, then they then they start becoming, you know, real meaningful,

**00:08:53** impactful on the rest of your life kind of problems. And this is also the part where for me,

**00:08:58** I started keeping track of a notebook of just like writing stuff down in a notebook and referring

**00:09:05** back to it. People often ask me like, oh, when you first started using a notebook, like what was

**00:09:10** the system? What were you doing? And the answer is there was no system at all. It was just getting

**00:09:15** in the habit of if there's something in your head, get it out of your head and put it on a piece of

**00:09:21** paper. And as long as you come back to that piece of paper on some regular basis, you'll start to

**00:09:29** build up your own kind of system. Like, of course, we spend pretty much all of our time talking

**00:09:35** about how our apps and devices are the things that we use to keep track of this stuff. But

**00:09:42** pen and paper is the absolute best way to begin. Oh, for sure. Yeah.

**00:09:48** Making lists. And this is like, you know, take notes and that kind of stuff, but making lists,

**00:09:53** lists of things you want to do, lists of things you should do. That's how I started. Like,

**00:09:57** I was kind of predisposed to this. My entire working life, I've always had some kind of

**00:10:02** to-do list checklist because I was perfectly placed for it as a person that has a predilection

**00:10:08** for two things, pens and paper and nicely designed apps. Oh, right. Yes. That makes much more sense

**00:10:15** that this path was much more obvious to you than it was to me. Because I wanted to have an excuse

**00:10:20** to use pens and paper or like OmniFocus looks like a nicely designed application for the iPhone.

**00:10:27** I'll get that boy in his first banking job that nobody cares about him. But he's got like a 25

**00:10:35** pound application that he's using. Right. Right. Yeah, that's what I'm going to do.

**00:10:39** But, you know, so I have always found it very easy to start this stuff because I wanted to use

**00:10:48** the things that were involved in it. But if you don't come at it from my perspective and most

**00:10:53** people don't, they come at it from Grace perspective, starting in the same places,

**00:10:58** pen and paper is perfect because it removes by its simplicity the complications that any

**00:11:08** application will give you. Right. Like any half decent application, all of the apps that we'll

**00:11:13** talk about today of the stuff that we use, they want projects from you. They want dates and times

**00:11:20** from you. They want notification access. They want to be able to integrate with this part of

**00:11:27** the system. Like they want so much and it can seem like a big hurdle to jump over. But if you just

**00:11:33** start by getting a notebook of any kind and a pen of any kind and just write down every day, like

**00:11:39** these are the things I have to do or want to do or a combination of the both, you check them all off.

**00:11:43** And then the next day you just write that list out again. Like, yeah, that's the start of any of

**00:11:49** these types of systems. And no matter what you end up graduating to, and maybe it's nothing,

**00:11:54** because for many people, this is a perfectly valid way to keep it going. It's just to write out a pen

**00:11:59** and paper list every day. No matter what it is you end up graduating to, you will benefit from

**00:12:04** having spent the time at these real basics. If you really don't want to use a pen and paper,

**00:12:09** any notes app, just like a bulleted list, right? Like Google Keep, Apple Notes, they'll all let you

**00:12:15** make checklists, right? You can just use those and it's nice and simple.

**00:12:20** Yeah. I mean, my entire teaching career when I was teaching physics, I ran all of the organization

**00:12:27** of what classes do I need to prepare for what needs to be done. That was an entirely paper-based

**00:12:33** system. Sometimes I was just using index cards and sometimes I was using some pieces of paper on a

**00:12:39** clipboard and teaching is a job where there's like, there's a million things to keep track of. And

**00:12:44** paper is totally up to that task. Like you don't need a digital system. Again, if someone is

**00:12:50** listening to this and they're at that starting point where they just feel overwhelmed, right?

**00:12:56** Like they've come to this show because someone has said, oh, start with this episode if you

**00:13:01** don't know where to start, right? And then like, okay, well, the probability then is it's a person

**00:13:04** who might be feeling overwhelmed about like, what do I do? And you have a problem with that,

**00:13:10** with that of like, you want to try to solve this feeling of overwhelmedness and you want to try to

**00:13:15** solve like, I don't know what to do. So you have a problem, which is that your life is disorganized.

**00:13:22** Well, if you're trying to also learn a to-do app at the same time, now you have two problems,

**00:13:27** right? And it's like, this doesn't help you at all. And yeah, any notebook will do, you know,

**00:13:34** one of my favorite things to do with people when they're overwhelmed is to either take like a bunch

**00:13:40** of A4 pages and cut them in half or take index cards and just like start writing down on each

**00:13:49** half sheet of paper or each index card something that's on your mind. The garage is a huge mess,

**00:13:55** like, and you put that on one index card. Just like start writing down the stuff that's on your mind.

**00:14:01** And this is where I really think paper does have an advantage that there is something more real

**00:14:08** about physically writing with your hand to get out the thoughts in your head,

**00:14:14** then typing them in a list. And it's still something that I do now, years later, as a person

**00:14:20** who feels like I have my life very well organized, three, four times a year, like I'll just sit down

**00:14:26** with some index cards or some paper and just start writing out some stuff as a kind of calibration of

**00:14:33** where I am. And when you do that, you'll naturally start to see, you know, the reason why I think like

**00:14:41** index cards are half pieces of paper is you kind of start to see, oh, these things are all related,

**00:14:47** right? You know, these things are connected to each other or like this thing really needs to

**00:14:52** happen before this thing. And with just paper on a desk, you can move it around and put things that

**00:14:59** are related near each other. And again, I think that process of physically moving the things in

**00:15:06** your life around is much more helpful than digitally moving items up or down a list.

**00:15:13** If you want to feel like you're in control of something, physically moving it will definitely

**00:15:19** Yes, I have power over this task because I can move it anywhere on this desk.

**00:15:24** This task can't move me. Look how flimsy it is.

**00:15:27** Yeah, it's just a piece of paper. Yeah, it's an excellent point there. So that is the great place

**00:15:32** to start. And once you've done that, then you can start looking at some of the specifics of,

**00:15:38** okay, you know, how do I want to organize this? And you should almost certainly start with paper

**00:15:43** lists. But even then, you've now separated the get everything off your mind phase from the

**00:15:49** how do I want to organize it going forward phase, which is completely impossible if you're just

**00:15:55** starting with a to do app that you're not familiar with, no matter how simple it looks,

**00:16:00** like they all have their weird quirks that paper just doesn't. So I think that's, that's really a

**00:16:05** place to start. Yeah, starting with a very, very, very simple, not to do app pen and paper thoroughly

**00:16:11** recommend, but if you really don't want to do that, every device has a notes app, use the notes app.

**00:16:16** Yeah, once you start doing that for a while, I think you'll start to get an idea of to what

**00:16:21** things feel important to you. So like, one of the things that pushed me to an application was,

**00:16:26** all right, I like having this stuff, but I want something to tell me to do it. So therefore,

**00:16:32** I needed notifications, right? Like, right, that if you know, I can write these things down,

**00:16:36** but I still have to remember that this task has to be done at two o'clock on Wednesday.

**00:16:41** Well, when you start getting to those kinds of areas, that's where you need to start looking

**00:16:45** for an application of some kind. And there are many, many options. I think it would be too much

**00:16:52** for us even to try and list the things that we've used. But I think these days, there really are,

**00:16:59** I think that there's even more kind of like, agreement on the stuff that people use.

**00:17:05** Even in like the last couple of years, it feels like there are less of these types of applications

**00:17:10** now. Do you think there's been a, because I don't, I don't follow the market very closely,

**00:17:15** but do you feel like there's been a consolidation of to-do apps over time?

**00:17:18** Yes. And I think there are a couple of reasons. One, too many means that they can't all exist,

**00:17:22** right? You can't make enough business models that way. And there's also been consolidation

**00:17:27** for purchases. Like, a good old friend, Wunderlist, is gone now.

**00:17:31** Oh, I know that Wunderlist disappeared.

**00:17:34** Did it take the app dying for me to get you to say it that way?

**00:17:37** It caused a great disruption in the life of my assistant who ran everything on Wunderlist.

**00:17:44** And she was like, she was going down on a sinking ship and there was a lot of like,

**00:17:48** help, help, what do I turn to? So I'm very, I'm very aware they're gone.

**00:17:52** The original founder is starting a new app called Superlist.

**00:17:58** Serious, like they are. I don't know when it's coming, but like, that's the thing that's happening.

**00:18:03** Right. But you need a silly way to say that one. You need to be able to call it like

**00:18:06** mooper list or something.

**00:18:07** Like supper, supper list.

**00:18:10** So these days, I think really, Todoist, I think Todoist is king because it's everywhere.

**00:18:18** So like, it's the easy recommendation. But then depending on the platform we use,

**00:18:23** there are other options. Obviously, we are both way more familiar with the iOS side.

**00:18:28** And so like, OmniFocus things, they're like the big, these three, they're like the big

**00:18:34** heavyweights in this from the sense of they are popular, but also they have a lot of potential

**00:18:40** complexity to them. You know, you can add your due dates and times, but you can also start adding

**00:18:46** projects and tags, contacts and all these wild things, which really you should only start looking

**00:18:53** into if you feel that your needs are not being met.

**00:18:56** Yeah, obviously, I'm not very familiar with Todoist because I find myself physically repulsed by it

**00:19:02** every time I try.

**00:19:03** It's getting better all the time.

**00:19:05** I'm sure it is, but like I just found like, oh, the physics of the way this button slides, I hate,

**00:19:10** right? Like everything, everything about it just rubbed me the wrong way. But to be fair,

**00:19:14** I haven't used it in a while. But this is also the thing where selecting a Todo app for yourself,

**00:19:19** it can be really picky.

**00:19:21** Yes, it's a difficult task to undertake.

**00:19:24** Yeah. And I think it's why even if there has been consolidation in the market,

**00:19:28** there's still like infinite room for new players to come in and try because everybody's always

**00:19:33** picky in their own little ways. And yes, like this is one of the things where it's kind of funny that

**00:19:38** like paper kind of has a psychological advantage because you never find yourself thinking,

**00:19:44** oh, I wish this paper did this, right? Like your brain just accepts it as a physical object in the

**00:19:49** world. Whereas with Todo apps, you're always going to be a little bit like, I wish it did it this way.

**00:19:54** My flow of recommendation would be, you know, if you're if you're picking an app for the first

**00:20:01** time, I usually recommend things to people. I think it's a nice combination of looks good,

**00:20:09** it's easy to use. And it has some but not too much level of complexity in it. So like things is my

**00:20:19** starting recommendation.

**00:20:20** I find things a difficult starting recommendation.

**00:20:23** Okay, why?

**00:20:24** Because it's in the sense of applications expensive. And unlike Todoist and Only Focus

**00:20:32** has no get in the door for free.

**00:20:35** Yeah, that is true. That's true.

**00:20:36** I think things is a good second step after reminders. I find myself always forgetting

**00:20:42** reminders these days from these lists. Like reminders has a lot of the basics in it now,

**00:20:48** which it didn't before. So reminders is is another option for a first step. But I do agree with you,

**00:20:56** like things is a it's designed so well, it makes it nice to use, I find that it has some fundamental

**00:21:05** problems which stopped me from using it. Like this is something that I've noticed along with like some

**00:21:11** friends for years, like this is pretty esoteric, but it's important for me. Like if you have a

**00:21:16** repeating task, you cannot complete it before the day it's due.

**00:21:20** Okay, right. I see what you mean.

**00:21:22** Yeah, so if I ever repeating task every Wednesday, but on Monday, I completed that task, it won't

**00:21:27** let me check it off until Wednesday. And that's just like, what are you doing? Right? Like it's

**00:21:32** such a weird quirk. So there are things like that was like that would frustrate me too much.

**00:21:37** And this is the thing you got to understand about all these types of applications. Like

**00:21:40** none of them will work the way that you want them to completely. And it's about what level of this

**00:21:46** is okay enough. Because all of these applications are built by people with their opinions. And this

**00:21:53** is a very particular part, I would say probably the most particular of all of these, like even

**00:21:59** more so than email, the to do system, people want it to work the exact way that they want it to work.

**00:22:04** And nobody wants to work the same as anybody else.

**00:22:08** Yes, yeah, that's that's what I mean by there's always infinite room for new entrants into the

**00:22:13** market. Because I do think it is literally the most picky software category that can possibly

**00:22:22** exist. That also a large number of people use and are like, I just wish it was a little different

**00:22:26** this way. I guess I sort of bounce off reminders, but you might be right that I should update that

**00:22:32** of like, reminders is the place to start. If you're willing to pay for a thing that looks beautiful,

**00:22:38** things is a place to start because I do think things maximizes on the beauty scale.

**00:22:44** Yes, but it is both of those apps. I think once you get the hang of putting your life in lists,

**00:22:52** and you you start to think about the concepts of the repeating tasks and all this other stuff,

**00:22:58** you will know very quickly if you're the sort of person who is going to outgrow those apps. And

**00:23:05** then that's where for me, OmniFocus sits at the at the top of the list as an extremely heavy weight

**00:23:13** option. But you'll know if you feel like this isn't working for me. And todoist also seems like it

**00:23:20** has much more flexibility. It's not OmniFocus level, though. I didn't say that it was. Nothing is.

**00:23:26** You'll know if you outgrow reminders and you're looking for something else.

**00:23:29** I thought it might be useful for us to talk about kind of like, at a basic level,

**00:23:34** what our systems look like. And so for me, every task that I enter gets two things. And that's

**00:23:43** really the core of my system. So every task gets a due date and time assigned to it. Even if I don't

**00:23:50** really have a set time or date that something needs to be completed, I will just assign one

**00:23:58** to it. And then I can choose later on if I want to move it. But I think to myself, either A,

**00:24:03** when does this need to be done by or B, when would I like this to be done by? That's every

**00:24:09** time I start a task, I put that in there, because then it always shows up in my list of upcoming

**00:24:15** tasks in todoist, because otherwise they kind of like sit off on the side and I may forget about

**00:24:20** them. And I very frequently review what I've got over the next few days and move them around.

**00:24:26** The second thing that every task gets is a project. And I break these projects down into

**00:24:33** different areas of responsibility in my work or personal life. So I have projects that are focused

**00:24:40** around preparing for shows, editing shows, I have them for general admin stuff. I also have personal

**00:24:46** and long term personal projects, that kind of stuff, right? So I have these little buckets that

**00:24:51** I will put my tasks into. And this just helps me kind of visually see what areas I need to be

**00:24:57** thinking about. But also if I think to myself, oh, I want to just sit down and do some editing today,

**00:25:04** what editing projects do I have upcoming, I can click in and see those. Now, my system is

**00:25:10** purposefully kept quite basic in this way. I think this is like the most basic and advanced system

**00:25:16** can be is to have these things is to have a sense of setting due times and everything and setting

**00:25:23** projects for everything. Because then you can start going to other levels and Grey will have

**00:25:28** these I'm sure where you're like setting start dates and defer dates and tags and locations and

**00:25:36** all that kind of stuff. And I have dabbled in it. But for me personally, I have felt that none of

**00:25:42** those things helped me be more productive. And if anything, increase the amount of time it would

**00:25:48** take for me from having a thought to getting into to do list. So now I have basically boiled my

**00:25:54** system down to the basics of like, a task has a name, and it has a date and time set to it.

**00:26:02** And it will have a project set to it. In some instances, I may add some notes to the task,

**00:26:08** or I may add some dependent tasks to that one task, right? So like, yes, I also need to do these

**00:26:14** three other things to call this one thing complete. But that stuff is is rare for me. It really is kind

**00:26:20** of just the project and the due time. This is another one of these things about learning how

**00:26:25** you work. Yes, because everyone who uses a to do system, I think it tends to coalesce around

**00:26:34** something in that to do system, which is primary for them. And the system that you're using, I

**00:26:39** think is the most common where people put a due date on every item. That is the most important

**00:26:44** part. The projects I could take or leave the most important part is having a due time because

**00:26:48** otherwise, I'll tell you, it's not getting done. But this is what I mean is like, so your system,

**00:26:54** then you think of all of the things in terms of this of like, there is the due date and the due

**00:27:00** date is central. And I think like that's a really common system. It doesn't work for me, I hate the

**00:27:07** due dates. And it's also why like, oh, I find other systems frustrating. But this is where like, you

**00:27:12** just need to learn what it is that works for you. And so one of the main reasons why I stick with

**00:27:19** OmniFocus is I almost never use due dates. Like I'm on the extreme opposite end of mic. In my whole

**00:27:26** system, very, very few things have a due date attached to them. Because conceptually for me,

**00:27:33** if there is a due date that's attached, it has to mean like there's a real hard external problem

**00:27:41** that occurs if this due date is missed. What I end up doing is I have a system that is primarily

**00:27:49** based around availability, like which tasks are available to me to do right now. And, and this is

**00:27:58** where OmniFocus and our old friend, remember the milk, are the only two task managers I've ever

**00:28:06** come across that handle this kind of availability centricness as well as they do. So like you,

**00:28:13** my basic structure is in OmniFocus, I have a bunch of folders for general areas of my life.

**00:28:19** Like, oh, this is work. Here's a folder for my personal life. Here's a folder for miscellaneous

**00:28:26** things. And then within that, I break it down by the categories of like, okay, here's all the

**00:28:31** videos that I'm working on. Here are all the podcasts that are in motion. Here's miscellaneous,

**00:28:36** other things that need to get done. So everything is like structured in this kind of hierarchy where

**00:28:42** I can build out all the different parts of like, what are all the steps that need to happen in

**00:28:50** order for an episode of Cortex to go from, you know, nothing to published on my end. It's like,

**00:28:56** okay, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. Here's a whole long list of those things. You know, here's all

**00:29:00** the steps that are necessary to get a video from conceptual phase to published. So I have that

**00:29:06** structure, but then the thing that OmniFocus allows me to do by having stuff categorized

**00:29:12** with their advanced features like tags is to be able to say in the morning, when I wake up

**00:29:19** and I get into the office, what is it that I want to do? I primarily want to focus on

**00:29:26** writing tasks or research tasks. And so OmniFocus then lets me just quickly see,

**00:29:33** here are the writing projects that past organized you has considered to be the top three that you

**00:29:39** should be working on. And so I don't have to look at the whole structure of the project. I can just

**00:29:47** pull out the couple parts that are relevant to me in that moment. So that's what I mean by like an

**00:29:52** availability centric process or, you know, sometimes I feel like I can just tell I'm not quite in the

**00:30:00** right mood to write something, but I have recorded a bunch of research questions that I want to try

**00:30:07** to get answers to. So let me try to like knock off a few of those and like, here we go in OmniFocus.

**00:30:12** Let me pull up like, here's 10 questions I just made a quick note of while I was working on a

**00:30:16** project of like, you know, how many of X is Y or like, when did this thing originally start? And now

**00:30:22** like use this time to go try to track down a bunch of these. And that's the sort of system that works

**00:30:27** really well for me. But it does have a much more upfront cost in knowing how to categorize things

**00:30:35** and using advanced features like defer dates that will hide things for you. But the reason that is

**00:30:41** important to me is because I know from experience, I cannot stand it when a to do list manager has

**00:30:49** any way where you can see items that you cannot check off right now. And like I just cannot stand

**00:30:57** that. And so I'll put in a lot of effort to make sure that the system is only showing me the things

**00:31:02** that I can do at any particular moment. So that's like the availability system. That's what works

**00:31:07** for me. So like your most important buckets are fixed to either times or locations, right? Yeah,

**00:31:16** the way I'm slicing the tasks is I would say times, locations, and energy level kind of stuff.

**00:31:24** So I have a few ways where I can look at what are a bunch of work tasks that are easy for me just to

**00:31:30** knock off right now. Communications clearing is one of these things where sometimes it's like,

**00:31:37** I have to interact with the outside world. Let me pull up this list of like everything I've made a

**00:31:42** note on that requires communications. And let me just try to clear a bunch of these. And it's like,

**00:31:46** oh, write an email to this expert about this thing, you know, or get back to this person about this

**00:31:52** thing. And so like, let me just knock off a bunch of those in a row. So that's the way I always want

**00:31:56** to look at that kind of stuff. If this sounds complicated, it's because it is complicated.

**00:32:01** And this is good, because OmniFocus will allow you to create effectively rules or filters, which say

**00:32:08** like, if this is set to this, and this is set to this, and it's these times of the day, show me this.

**00:32:14** Yeah. And so it's a very complicated system. But what makes OmniFocus the best what it does is if

**00:32:22** you are the type of person that wants to attach a bunch of metadata to a task, you can do some

**00:32:27** incredibly powerful things. But it's also why it's not a good starter program. Like it's, it's going

**00:32:33** to have way too much, it's going to really overwhelm you expert level, it really is expert level. And

**00:32:38** it's, it's also a lot of the stuff that I'm able to do. I'm doing because I have shortcuts in iOS

**00:32:46** that are assisting me. So like, I'm not interacting with the application directly, like I have little

**00:32:52** templates for this is what a video project looks like, this is what every episode of Cortex looks

**00:32:57** like. So I'm able to put in a huge number of items that have been pre categorized by me in the past,

**00:33:04** because otherwise it would just be too overwhelming to do it each time. Or like when I say, oh, this is

**00:33:10** like a research question that's related to a project, I have a very quick way with shortcuts,

**00:33:15** where I can write as little as possible. And shortcuts will handle just put this in the

**00:33:20** correct place and file it. Because that's the way I solve the problem of what you were saying before

**00:33:26** of you don't want it to be a heavyweight issue to input something into the system, putting something

**00:33:33** into the system should be really easy. But if you want to put something into a complicated system in

**00:33:41** a really easy way that does require a lot of upfront work in order to do, or you could run these

**00:33:47** applications the way that they were kind of created and intended, which is you just enter

**00:33:54** everything very basically, and then review the tasks and add that data later. So you would sit

**00:34:02** down once a day or once every couple of days, look at everything that you've entered into the

**00:34:06** apps inbox, and then assign it the information that it that it needs. Yeah, OmniFocus does have

**00:34:12** a review feature where they specifically allow you to see all of the stuff that they think you

**00:34:17** should be looking over and categorizing. And like that is totally fine. But I just I just find like,

**00:34:23** if you're using OmniFocus, you're probably using it because you have a lot of items, right? Like

**00:34:29** the people I speak to who are using OmniFocus, none of them have a small number of projects,

**00:34:35** right? They're all doing this same thing where like they've got a lot of projects with a lot

**00:34:39** of items in it. And so I think the review can become a little overwhelming when you start having

**00:34:45** a huge number of things. And so the the assistance in inputting is really important. But I really

**00:34:52** love it. Like it's it's totally for me. But it is a real investment to learn how to use it properly.

**00:34:58** But once you have it, it's fantastic. Just as a little a little thing here, not connected to

**00:35:03** OmniFocus in particular, but for someone putting together their own to do system just in general.

**00:35:08** A little tip that I really like, and I cannot remember where I originally came across this,

**00:35:12** but for almost any of these apps, you're going to have this concept of there's a project and then

**00:35:18** the project has little actions that you're going to complete to get that project done. Right? Most

**00:35:25** systems will have this at least this two tier concept, project and actions. And I think it's

**00:35:32** really helpful to always try to write the project in the past tense as in like, what is the state of

**00:35:43** the world when this project is complete? So it's like teacher certification acquired, right?

**00:35:51** Cortex episode published, research thesis submitted, that kind of stuff. Like I think

**00:35:58** it's really helpful to write that in the past tense and then you write the actions

**00:36:04** that they have to have a verb in there. There's an action that you're clearly taking, right? Go to

**00:36:11** library. There's a direction there. And I've just always found that really helpful when you're

**00:36:17** looking over your projects. There's something about that past tense writing of the project

**00:36:23** that I find really provokes my brain into coming up with what are the verbs we need in order to

**00:36:31** make this happen. That's just my little like recommendation there for how to do this is like,

**00:36:36** I find that extremely helpful no matter which system you're using. And I try very hard to stick

**00:36:42** to that with all of my projects and all of my actions. It's like past tense and verbs.

**00:36:48** This episode of Cortex is brought to you by Raycon. Whether you're working from home or working on

**00:36:53** your fitness, you want what you're listening to to be what you choose to listen to. You don't want

**00:36:59** to be listening to your roommates on a conference call or a vacuum cleaner in the apartment next

**00:37:03** door. Everybody needs a great pair of wireless earbuds. But before you go dropping hundreds and

**00:37:09** hundreds of dollars on a pair, I want you to check out Raycon's wireless earbuds. They start at about

**00:38:54** This next category, email systems, I've both been dreading the most and looking forward to the most.

**00:39:01** The wheel.

**00:39:03** I like talking to you about how you handle email because it's always such a fun thing for me.

**00:39:08** Right.

**00:39:09** But then we have to talk about email apps and I will state my long-running mantra at this point

**00:39:14** that no email apps are good. It does not exist. There is no email app which I have ever been

**00:39:22** able to find with the exception of one Sparrow. Rest in peace Sparrow. You know what actually,

**00:39:28** mailbox. I prefer mailbox to Sparrow. Mailbox is the app that was built by Dropbox who had a

**00:39:34** feature that I still to this day cannot believe that nobody else has copied, which is the ability

**00:39:39** to rearrange emails in an inbox.

**00:39:42** And it's shocking no one will let you do that.

**00:39:44** I can't believe it. It was like when that app was first being teased, that was the thing that was

**00:39:50** everyone was like, wow, right? Like that you would be able to just drag and drop and just change the

**00:39:54** order arbitrarily. I can't believe nobody's tried to do that. Everyone's just like, look at us. We

**00:40:00** built a smart email inbox that uses our AI. No, I don't want your AI in my email. I want to just

**00:40:07** rearrange it with my own eye, right? My own intelligence. I don't need no fake intelligence.

**00:40:12** See, look, I've already started. We haven't even started talking about it. I'm getting angry.

**00:40:17** Well, look, the reason it gets angry is email is going to make you angry, right?

**00:40:20** Yeah.

**00:40:21** And the problem with email, the fundamental problem with email is it's the uncontrollable

**00:40:28** interface with the outside world, right? You can be at your desk with your nice pen and your nice

**00:40:34** paper and you can make the lists however you want and nobody can come along and just like

**00:40:40** start messing with your paper if you're just sitting, you know, sitting quietly on your own.

**00:40:45** But if you're trying to handle your email while you're handling it, stuff's going to come in,

**00:40:49** right? And it's like, what is this? It's such a frustrating thing compared to most of the other

**00:40:56** things that we're going to talk about today, the underlining, like where the data is coming from,

**00:41:01** you have no control over with email. Yeah. Like we have to do apps with calendar apps

**00:41:07** by and large, like whilst these things are influenced by outside elements and maybe some

**00:41:15** of it is shared, you are still controlling the data that gets put into the systems. Yeah.

**00:41:21** But with email, it's just coming in and you can't stop it, right? Like that, whatever it is,

**00:41:28** from wherever it's coming from, it's just going to be there. And there are some tools that are

**00:41:34** trying to change this, which I want to, we're going to talk about these in a later episode

**00:41:39** of Cortex, because I think it's kind of very cute and hilarious that there are companies that are

**00:41:44** trying to change, quote unquote, change email. Not like in the Slack way, but as in like, we have

**00:41:50** changed the fundamentals of how email works. We will park that for today. Okay. But from a

**00:41:56** perspective of how we manage email, I am much more typical. Yeah. I want to know your philosophy of

**00:42:03** email. Email comes in and I deal with email, right? Like I really don't, I don't prescribe to

**00:42:10** inbox zero in the way people now believe what that means. The original intention of inbox zero

**00:42:17** is basically as a way to categorize your email and then handle it where people think that inbox zero

**00:42:23** is get my inbox to zero, which is not correct by the basic idea of what the phrase is supposed to

**00:42:30** mean. Nor do I think that trying to achieve inbox zero, which is what every email app seems to

**00:42:36** applaud you for these days, right? Like if you have a nothing in your inbox, they put up these

**00:42:40** little graphics and they're like, ah, you got nothing in your inbox. Like that is not a goal

**00:42:45** to try and aspire to because it's only going to fill up again. Even if you get there, it's going

**00:42:51** to be really fleeting, right? Yeah. Well, for me, my basic philosophy is try and have as little email

**00:42:57** in my inbox as possible because it has been dealt with, right? So, which, so I think really my

**00:43:03** personal philosophy is closer to the original idea behind inbox zero of process the email,

**00:43:10** right? Like that's what you're supposed to do. And for me, that takes forms of either a replying to

**00:43:15** it or be removing it, right? Like that's kind of how I deal with my email, but I am much more

**00:43:21** traditional in, I have notifications for my email. So I want to know when the email's coming in, in

**00:43:26** case it's something important and I will handle the email. My personal rule is to not let my email

**00:43:33** inbox scroll off my iPhone too far. Like I don't want there to be too many emails. I like the

**00:43:39** immediate addition thereof too far. Because again, it's like, if I am being too rigid with this,

**00:43:47** then I am imposing myself upon myself something which I can't control because the email's going

**00:43:53** to keep coming. Right. So like for me with my task lists, I try to not let my daily tasks go

**00:44:00** into double digits. Right. And so I can control that by moving things around. But the way I would

**00:44:07** control email is just like, I'll just delete everything. But that's not helpful, right? I

**00:44:13** can't just keep deleting emails until I'm at the level that I want to be at visually, you know?

**00:44:19** So multiple times a day we'll handle my email. A lot of my email is handled as it's coming in.

**00:44:24** I'll see something that I want to respond to and I will respond to it or I will remove it,

**00:44:29** right? Like one of the reasons that I have notifications is so I can triage my email as

**00:44:34** well. So when I come to my email inbox, the stuff that I didn't want to see has been archived

**00:44:40** because I archived it when the notification came in. Right. And I use a service called same box

**00:44:46** that does some email filtering for me. So like some of the newsletters that I receive can actually

**00:44:51** just be put into a folder. So it's not filling up my inbox, which I enjoy, because otherwise,

**00:44:56** a newsletter is not paying for, they would be archived because they'd be taking up space,

**00:45:01** you know? Right, right. But I feel like I'm very typical in like, email is a massive part of my

**00:45:07** work. And so handling it in a prompt manner by replying to the messages is effectively how I

**00:45:15** handle email. And I think that that is a very typical system for most people in any type of

**00:45:21** corporate job, right? I learned these skills working in a corporate environment. I don't

**00:45:27** necessarily think that they are the best thing for people's mental health, like always be in the

**00:45:32** email. So it does require some level of self control, which I've just built over time. But I

**00:45:40** feel better knowing what's happening with the type of job that I have. And so getting email coming in

**00:45:47** via notification works better for me. And I have noticed a better improvement for me since I stopped

**00:45:53** getting those notifications on my wrist, and just left them on my phone. I feel like that's much

**00:45:58** better for me, like still getting notifications, but like they're not physically interacting with

**00:46:04** me anymore. And by tapping me on my wrist to tell me the notifications here, that's just my general

**00:46:09** role of Apple Watch now, like my Apple Watch is on do not disturb all the time. It is not a

**00:46:15** notification device for me at all anymore, which is kind of funny, because that's what it initially

**00:46:19** was when I started using one. But yeah, so that's where I am with email, though, like the email comes

**00:46:24** in, I try and manage the email. And that's it. You're triaging like the triage at a hospital

**00:46:30** when people come into the emergency room, like right away, you know, try to take care of that.

**00:46:34** I'm triaging in the sense of how triage should be done. Like, which is right away. Like if you're

**00:46:40** triaging in a hospital by letting everybody build up and just deal with it in two weeks,

**00:46:44** like a triage. Yeah, that's how I triage. Yeah, which is bad triage is once every two

**00:46:50** weeks, we decide what's urgent. Now people people should 100% listen to you when it comes to how to

**00:46:57** handle email and not listen to me. I think there's somewhere in the middle is like ideal. But I think

**00:47:02** that the realistic part of it is that my way of managing it is kind of the way that it needs to

**00:47:08** be managed because that's the expectation of the world. Yeah. Yeah. I'm in a bit of a

**00:47:16** not helpful to most people situation of being able to largely ignore email mostly and also being at

**00:47:25** the receiving end of a ridiculously large amount of email. So like, I'm just at a odd intersection.

**00:47:33** But the thing that I can say here though, is that I've been using emails slowly much more

**00:47:40** because of some project shifts that sort of coincided with your clarity stuff where I've

**00:47:46** had to be able to interact with the outside world more in a direct way. Like if I'm reaching out to

**00:47:51** experts for things, like I need to be able to reply to those people and like get their feedback

**00:47:57** back. And you know, if I'm arranging things, I need to be able to know if something has changed on

**00:48:02** a more frequent than never basis like it was before. So it's been kind of interesting to me

**00:48:07** kind of coming back to email, but my triage system, which I do think would still work even if

**00:48:14** you're using email much more frequently is I use email exclusively on my Mac because of one feature

**00:48:23** of mail, the default application that Apple has, which is these smart mailboxes where you can set

**00:48:30** a bunch of rules. And so I've returned to the thing that I did years and years ago when I was

**00:48:36** more an email of, of using smart email boxes to be able to triage the category of people.

**00:48:44** And so it's like, okay, I use Apple's VIP system to tag people who I want to be able to reply to

**00:48:50** on a relatively quick basis. You know, so that's like my assistants or other people that I'm

**00:48:56** working with or experts relevant to an ongoing project. Like I can tag those people as, as VIPs

**00:49:04** and it does allow me by then just having those people in one particular group.

**00:49:09** It allows me to very quickly see has that person gotten back to me or have the plans changed at

**00:49:14** all? And I was like, Nope, okay, fine. And I can just kind of close it. So it pulls out those

**00:49:19** important things to me. And then my second level down is everybody else who's in my contact

**00:49:26** book on the computer in some way. So it's like, have I ever created a contact card for this person?

**00:49:32** And in many ways that is now my real inbox. And I do my best to clear that one, although it can

**00:49:39** still be quite a lot sometimes, especially cause I'm not looking super frequently. The real killer

**00:49:45** thing to me about the smart mailboxes is adding a bunch of rules so that I can pull out all of the

**00:49:52** automated notifications that you get an email from like a million billion systems.

**00:49:56** There is some of this that you could do with Gmail, right?

**00:49:59** Oh yeah. Yeah. I like, I know that this is possible in Gmail. I just like,

**00:50:03** I find the, because I use Apple's smart features in a bunch of other apps, like I'm already really

**00:50:10** familiar with the system and it works like it works with a bunch of other stuff.

**00:50:13** It's criminal that they still have not brought these to iOS.

**00:50:16** I remember thinking like, Oh, this, this will be here any day. And it's like 10 years later,

**00:50:21** they still have not imported it over. And same with smart albums on iPhoto and, and smart,

**00:50:25** smart playlists are to some extent on the music, but yeah, I think it's crazy.

**00:50:29** But yeah, so I do now try on a regular basis as part of my like reviewing the system to clear

**00:50:36** at least like the top two levels of the VIPs and people who are in my address book in some way,

**00:50:42** and then look at all the automated notifications. And then after that is like the, like the pit of

**00:50:48** infinity of just like all of the random emails from people. I have no idea who they are.

**00:50:54** I can't fathom you ever opening that folder.

**00:50:57** Well, that's what I mean is like the pit of infinity, because what happens is

**00:51:00** looking into the arc of the covenant.

**00:51:01** Yeah, by the time I've cleared the messages that I need to try to reply to, I'm so exhausted already.

**00:51:08** Right. That I'm like, I don't want to deal with this. And again, why I'm in a situation that's

**00:51:14** not really applicable to many people, but I think the people who are actually trying to get in touch

**00:51:19** with me and trying to figure out like, oh, I think I have something that's useful for gray.

**00:51:24** What's the best way to get in touch with him? Are realizing like he's got a contact form on his

**00:51:29** website that says, please use this to get in touch. That's probably the way. And then like,

**00:51:34** my assistant is elevating those interesting messages up to me. So it's like, there is a

**00:51:39** really big filtering effect here.

**00:51:41** Which is like one, follow the rules, right? Like, yeah, you can follow the rules, then maybe I want

**00:51:48** to hear what you have to say.

**00:51:49** Yeah. Yeah. It's a bit like, you know, a pro tip for anybody who's applying for a job. For almost

**00:51:56** any job, the rules about how you're supposed to apply for the job are part of the application.

**00:52:04** So even if there's something that you think is dumb with the way they want you to apply,

**00:52:08** they're seeing, can you follow the rules?

**00:52:11** Yeah. Like when, whenever I've been hiring and relay FM, like I want a resume and a cover

**00:52:16** letter. And if you didn't provide a cover letter, well, I'm not going to read your resume now.

**00:52:20** Yeah.

**00:52:20** Because I asked for something and you did decided not to do it or didn't read. And I think both of

**00:52:28** those two things would maybe indicate to me that I'm not sure how well we could work together.

**00:52:33** Yeah. So that's, that's roughly the way that I'm doing things now. And the only like tip that I

**00:52:38** have here is for me, email is largely interruptive. So it's a thing that I want to make a decision

**00:52:47** about. I am sitting down and this is part of my like an OmniFocus. This is part of my clearing

**00:52:53** the communications hierarchy. It was like, okay, I've cleared the top couple of levels and now I'm

**00:52:58** getting down to email and like I'm making a decision that I'm going to try to go through some

**00:53:01** emails. And so because of that, because there's basically never going to be anything in email

**00:53:06** that's actually urgent for me to deal with, I turn off all the notifications because they

**00:53:11** wouldn't help me with the way that I work.

**00:53:13** Yeah, it doesn't make sense for you. And again, like for a lot of people, I think a really great

**00:53:17** way to handle email is to have no notifications, but to have a set time every day that you would

**00:53:23** sit down and look at it. Like in previous careers, that's what I've done. But like, right, I will

**00:53:28** look at email between nine and 10 and between four and five and like that's, that's going to be it.

**00:53:33** And for many people in many careers, like that's enough. Like that really is enough. But for a

**00:53:40** couple of reasons for me, one being like that I do have things that tend to be quite time sensitive

**00:53:46** and two, like I have just learned over time that I feel better that way, right? Like I've tried

**00:53:52** both models and the idea of at four o'clock sitting down, opening up my email and there being 40

**00:53:57** things in there. I hate that feeling. So dipping my toe into email frequently throughout the day,

**00:54:04** marking off and getting rid of the things I don't want to deal with, assigning things to other

**00:54:09** people quickly. I'll get to that in a moment. And then leaving myself with the things that I have

**00:54:14** left that can be useful for me. And then it also allows me to start linking these two things that

**00:54:21** we've been talking about together. So I might have any email, which I'm aware of is going to

**00:54:25** take some time to prepare a response to. So then it goes into Todoist. I will make a task, right?

**00:54:31** But respond to this email and then that's out of the mental system then. And even if I want to,

**00:54:36** then I could put it in a folder to deal with it later on. Yeah. And this again goes back to the

**00:54:42** point that there's no one system for anyone. And my suggestions would be career suicide for many

**00:54:49** people. And also your suggestions would be career suicide for people. Like you've got to, you've got

**00:54:54** to figure out what part of this works for you. I'm going to say that my system is less

**00:54:58** significantly than yours, but oh, oh yeah. But there are some people, right? Where it's like,

**00:55:03** I think we know at least one person that can do the email the way you do. Yeah. Yeah. I guess,

**00:55:10** the only tip that I'll suggest here that really does work for me that, that I find really helpful

**00:55:14** is always sorting by sender, not sorting by date. I find particularly as I, as I move down the

**00:55:21** hierarchy, that becomes more and more useful is let me just deal with all the messages from this

**00:55:26** person at once. Or when you're getting into the automated messages stuff, where it's like, oh,

**00:55:32** here's 20 messages from Amazon that are all related to various purchases. Like, is there

**00:55:37** anything that I care about in here? No. Okay. I can just like archive 20 Amazon messages all at

**00:55:42** once, that kind of thing. So I almost always try to sort by sender instead of sorting by date. And

**00:55:49** I just find that makes it faster in batches sometimes of like, there's three emails from

**00:55:54** this person I can quickly see only if the most recent one is relevant and just kind of get rid

**00:55:57** of it and not feel like my brain has to boot up each time of like going down a list and being

**00:56:04** like, Oh, this is another message from this person. Is this relevant to the thing before?

**00:56:08** Like, no, no, I've already taken care of like this person and that's all closed.

**00:56:12** You know, from an app perspective, you mentioned Apple mail, which even though you are using for

**00:56:18** a complexity thing, like it has some powerful rule systems in it on the Mac,

**00:56:23** the Apple mail system itself is one of the more basic email apps that you could find.

**00:56:28** Oh, yeah. Yeah. The actual interface of it is super basic, which I also value.

**00:56:32** Yeah. And feature wise, like in the sense of what an email app is expected to do in the year 2020,

**00:56:39** the Apple mail is very low down in the total point.

**00:56:44** There's no boomeranging or whatever.

**00:56:47** Snoozing tends to be the the normal culture these days. And so these are, you know,

**00:56:52** Gmail does is better at this kind of stuff as in like having modern features like Gmail will do

**00:56:57** like automatic sorting for you if you want to write. Right. So it can it can automatically

**00:57:03** sort away newsletters and stuff like that. And that's really great. If you use Gmail,

**00:57:08** if you don't use Gmail and use other email services, then you need to think about other

**00:57:12** third party apps. And there are many, there are many. And they all differ in some way.

**00:57:19** The application that I have settled on is Spark. I don't particularly like a lot of the app like

**00:57:26** to perform a design perspective. There are things I don't like about it, but it has some features

**00:57:31** that I really have come to value, which is why I use it. So there are two key features for me these

**00:57:39** days for why I use Spark. One is it has the ability in two taps for me to make an email,

**00:57:48** a PDF and then to upload it to somewhere. And this is really important for me for accountancy

**00:57:55** purposes. So I get an email receipt, I turn it into a PDF and then I have a shortcut that uploads it

**00:58:02** to a specific Dropbox folder, which is fed into a system that my accountant needs. Right. So that's

**00:58:07** super useful to me. Every other application, it seems to be a pain, right? Like you have to go

**00:58:12** to the print menu and then you can have a PDF. Like I hate that. You print a PDF to your fax machine.

**00:58:18** Yes, it's wild. And then the other one, the most important thing is that Spark has an email team

**00:58:24** system so you can share email with other people. Yeah. That's always sounded really killer to me

**00:58:29** as far as a feature. It's amazing. I love that part of it. Like really, that's the main reason

**00:58:35** that I use Spark and won't look at other email apps now unless they have a similar system. And

**00:58:40** there are not a lot that do. So basically this allows me to take an email message that was sent

**00:58:46** to me and put it in somebody else's inbox and have them handle it. And then also have a conversation

**00:58:54** in line that the recipient of the email does not see. So I can talk to somebody like, what do you

**00:58:59** think about this? Can you do this? Can you handle this? And it's like a chat, which is around the

**00:59:03** email. It's a very cool system. It's very powerful. If it went away, I would be devastated.

**00:59:11** So that's why I use Spark. This here is also just an example of like, yeah, I'm using a really

**00:59:15** simple and old app that hasn't changed in, I mean, basically a decade has been pretty much untouched.

**00:59:22** And this is just another one of these cases where if you're organizing your life, like one of these

**00:59:27** key things to be aware of is what do you want to spend your time on? And like I have spent a lot

**00:59:34** of time trying out all of the different to do apps and knowing them well and seeing what works

**00:59:40** and what works for me. And like, that's a place that's worth investing in because it's an area

**00:59:44** where I need a lot of complexity. And it's also something that is open on my computer 24 hours a

**00:59:50** day that I'm always looking at. And email is the system that I spend an hour on once a week or once

**00:59:57** every 10 days. And so for me, like investing time into what is the app that could have me

**01:00:04** handle email the most efficiently is like a terrible return on investment in my time,

**01:00:08** because I'm already using it so poorly that I just don't even consider like, oh, let me investigate

**01:00:15** what the other email options are because it's not it's not remotely irrelevant bottleneck in my own

**01:00:20** process. And I think this is something that you always have to you always have to keep an eye on.

**01:00:25** But I think the thing that we've highlighted here for email is that both me and Gray have

**01:00:30** established a thing which is really important to us and dictates the choices that we make. So you

**01:00:36** want smart rule systems and I want team sharing like delegation. And those two things dictate the

**01:00:43** applications that we've ended up sticking with. And I actually think this is an important part

**01:00:48** of choosing an email app now, because all email apps, with the exception of Apple Mail, try to be

**01:00:54** everything and don't really have the in a lot of cases, like the design decisions that to do apps

**01:01:03** do. So this is why like, whilst there are lots of to do apps, lots of email apps, I don't say there

**01:01:08** are no good to do apps, there are good to do apps, because a lot of them come with an idea behind them,

**01:01:12** or I feel like most email apps these days, like try to be everything. And they can't all be

**01:01:18** everything. And I just think that ultimately, they leave things behind. And all of the best email

**01:01:23** apps that I've enjoyed have had a principle behind them, and have been designed thoughtfully

**01:01:30** about like, this is how we help you handle your email. And I just don't really feel like that's

**01:01:34** the case these days. And therefore, all email apps are bad, no email apps are good, you just have to

**01:01:40** find the one you like the you hate the least. Like the mmm, I can't bring myself to say like the most.

**01:01:51** I've tried basically every single email app, and there's always a problem. And look, I just say

**01:01:56** before people tell me the app that they've used, I guarantee you I've tried it. And there's something

**01:02:00** that I don't like about it. One of the big problems for me is the services supported by an app.

**01:02:07** There are some apps that are fantastic if you only use Gmail, but I don't. So I can't use that

**01:02:14** application. So like this happens a lot. So I just want to try and cover a few of these bases.

**01:02:19** Right, right. I know what you're doing. You're trying to like head off all the recommendations

**01:02:24** and let me tell you about right? Yeah. Trust me, I've tried them. This episode is brought to you

**01:04:07** website. Should we talk about time tracking? Honestly, this is the one that I get the most.

**01:04:11** I know it's almost a meme at this point that on our show, we talk about time tracking,

**01:04:15** but one of the main reasons we're doing this episode today is because of all of these things,

**01:04:20** the thing that I hear about the most frequently is people asking, can you give me an overview

**01:04:26** or tell me where to go to get an overview of your time tracking system? And so now we are providing

**01:04:32** it in this episode. Hmm. Okay. And I think it's because time tracking, I think is one of the newer,

**01:04:40** especially from like doing it with your devices. So one of the newer productivity ideas,

**01:04:46** email to do calendars. They've been around for a very long time. Right. Yeah. Calendars have been

**01:04:53** around since the Mayan civilization. Well, calendars have been around for all of time,

**01:04:58** I guess, because otherwise it wasn't being recorded. Would I would just know time still

**01:05:03** happens if there's not a calendar to report it. I can. If a calendar falls in the woods,

**01:05:09** the big bang happens and the nothingness, does it still expand? Yes. The answer is yes.

**01:05:14** Someone had to write it down eventually. Nevertheless, I feel like time tracking is

**01:05:18** one of the more new things for people to do of their own choice. Like the idea of time sheets

**01:05:24** has been around for a long time. Right. But that was typically something enforced upon you

**01:05:30** by an employer. Yeah. It's interesting that you say that, like, that the people are asking about

**01:05:35** it because what it also just occurs to me is I wonder if there's a little bit of the,

**01:05:40** like a horror movie effect here where people are intrigued because they're also a little scared.

**01:05:46** Right. Like sure that, you know, what will, if I open this time tracking door, what's behind it?

**01:05:51** And the answer is like, it's going to be scary. I would say it's clarity. That can be good or bad.

**01:06:01** Yeah. What you will learn is something about how wrong your brain is

**01:06:07** in estimating something, whether it's that you work too much or not enough. Right. Yeah.

**01:06:13** So that's the main reason why I started this. You know, you go back far enough. You've been

**01:06:20** doing this. You had been doing this for a while. And I, through having a bunch of conversations

**01:06:25** with you on this show, realized that I wanted to get a little bit more clarity, especially as I was

**01:06:31** navigating through self-employment about how many hours I was actually working compared to how many

**01:06:37** hours it felt like I was working. And that is like completely for me. And I, maybe for you too,

**01:06:44** like the reason that I time track is to, to help me reframe my mental model of what I'm spending

**01:06:52** my time on when it comes to work. Because when I'm working, I set a timer and I put basic information

**01:07:00** as to what I'm doing over that period of time. So then on a basis that I set, you know, or really

**01:07:07** for me, whenever I want to, I can review that data to see over a period of time, how much have I

**01:07:14** worked? Sometimes it can be to check something that I'm feeling, or it can be to help me make

**01:07:20** some plans. So for example, sometimes I'll get to the end of the day and I'm like, I am exhausted.

**01:07:26** And I'll look at my time tracker and be like, Oh, I've logged 10 hours, 12 hours of work today.

**01:07:32** That's why. Right. And that can just be a useful thing sometimes for me to check that against

**01:07:37** myself. Or I'm exhausted. Oh, wait, I've logged four hours of work today. So there's another reason.

**01:07:43** What's that reason? Right? So stuff like that. It can give me those answers or evaluate a new

**01:07:49** project. I have a new thing coming up or I have a new place that I want to put some time into.

**01:07:54** Let me take a look overall over the last year about how I spent my time. Is this the right

**01:08:00** thing for me to be spending time on based upon where I'm already putting my time? Right. So

**01:08:06** if I feel like, Oh, I have a new podcast that I want to start, but I'm not sure if I want to edit,

**01:08:12** I feel like I do too much editing. And then I take a look at the figures and realize, Oh boy,

**01:08:16** I'm doing more editing than I even thought I was based on hours. Then I would make a decision about

**01:08:21** this project as to either to not do it or to get external help to help me push something forward.

**01:08:28** Right. So these are the types of things that you can learn about yourself when you're time tracking,

**01:08:35** you know, like I hear something from friends of mine where they're like, Oh,

**01:08:41** I spent all this time on this project and I've put it out there and sales were okay on it. I don't

**01:08:47** know if it was the right decision to make, but from my perspective, if you don't know how long

**01:08:52** it took you to build that thing, you're never going to know the answer as to whether it was worth it

**01:08:57** or not. You know, like the amount of hours you put into it, the amount of money you see from the end

**01:09:01** of it, right? So this is especially important. If you're self-employed and making things, then you

**01:09:06** can work out an equation as to how much money your time was worth. These are important things.

**01:09:11** In my perspective, you can't have without some kind of time tracking system because your brain

**01:09:16** is not reliable enough. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, the reason that I time track is very different from

**01:09:22** this, but I think it's important for everyone, but especially if you've become self-employed,

**01:09:29** nobody ever wants to do it. But I really think every newly self-employed person has to have

**01:09:36** time tracking as a part of this process because I think there, there's a very common experience for

**01:09:42** people who are self-employed to dramatically overestimate the amount of time, not that they're

**01:09:50** working in quotes, but that they are usefully working. Right? So this is one of the things I

**01:09:58** implore to people is if you're, if you're self-employed and so the money you earn is directly

**01:10:06** proportional to the useful work that you produce, be really strict about tracking the time that you

**01:10:15** are actually doing the thing that produces the value. And you have to separate this from the

**01:10:24** concept of in a traditional job where like you're at that job for a set period of time and like

**01:10:30** you've been working all day because you were at work and like that is just not the same if

**01:10:36** you're self-employed. And I think time tracking really helps focus that quite sharply in people's

**01:10:42** minds. Yeah. And the reason why I say it's a horror is because anyone who has done this

**01:10:49** universally are shocked at how little of the time that they think of as I'm working

**01:10:57** is the core value production time of whatever it is they're doing. And so for me, the example with

**01:11:04** this is, it's quite clear is time tracking writing. Am I writing a script? And I'm extremely strict

**01:11:13** with that timer of like this starts and like the timer can only run if my fingers are moving,

**01:11:23** or if I'm saying the script out loud. And if I'm not doing those things, like the timer cannot run.

**01:11:30** If you're a computer programmer, it should be the same thing. Like, are you actively working on the

**01:11:35** code? Is the thing to be tracking not am I sitting at the computer? And I think it's just so easy to

**01:11:44** trick yourself into this. And especially for a newly self-employed person to feel like,

**01:11:51** oh, I'm working 16 hours a day. And it's like, guarantee you, you aren't and you just will not

**01:11:57** be able to have a sense of this. And while like all of work is useful to track, I implore people

**01:12:05** to really focus on like, what is the core value production and be super strict about that one,

**01:12:12** because everything else is kind of peripheral around it. And, you know, in most jobs, you can

**01:12:20** kind of think about like, what is the core thing that really needs to always be done that like has

**01:12:26** to be done back when I was a teacher? Like, what is the core thing? There's many things you need to

**01:12:32** do. But the core thing is lesson planning. Because if you don't have lessons for tomorrow, like the

**01:12:39** day is going to come and you are going to be screwed if you have nothing to do all day. It also

**01:12:46** clarifies like marking that homework, it can wait, right? Like you can start to use time tracking

**01:12:52** partly to like, sort out the priorities of things in your life. So I really implore everyone to do

**01:13:01** this, at least for a little bit. And I'm always suspicious of when people are resistant to it,

**01:13:07** where they're like, Oh, I don't need to do this. I've got everything under control. And I'm like,

**01:13:11** Nope, that is, I'm not talking to you. I'm talking to the sneeksy lying part of your brain that like

**01:13:18** wants to get away with stuff when you don't want to actually keep track of things. So I will say

**01:13:23** this though, that like a key difference between us that I've been aware of over the years is while I

**01:13:29** time track both much more than you. So I time track basically every hour that I'm awake,

**01:13:35** I'm running a timer with some new small exceptions we can talk about next week. But generally, like,

**01:13:40** I'm always running a timer. But I, I only really look at that data on a daily basis of the program

**01:13:49** that I'm using, which is the same one you're using behind the scenes toggle. If you have it in a web

**01:13:54** browser, they'll provide you like a little chart of how you're spending your time for the day.

**01:13:58** But that's really all I ever use it for. And so because I've been time tracking for so long,

**01:14:04** and I don't need to do as much of that, like initial calibration as, as when someone starts,

**01:14:11** I'm largely using time tracking as like an intentionality assistant. And so for me,

**01:14:18** it's become much more like pressing the timer for I'm writing is part of the process of like,

**01:14:25** I'm really writing now and like, why is this happening? Because the timer is running.

**01:14:31** When we finish recording this episode, you're going to go off and edit it. And then you're going

**01:14:36** to give that to me. And I'm going to go do the second edit. And it's like, what am I doing right

**01:14:41** now? I'm going to start the timer that says cortex because right now I'm working on cortex. And the

**01:14:48** thing that I really like about that is it makes it much clearer to me, what am I intentionally

**01:14:55** deciding to do instead of just kind of like drifting through the day when the moment comes

**01:15:02** where it's like, oh, I've finished cortex or I've petered out of writing energy. Now in my life,

**01:15:09** there's always this question, which is, well, what's the next timer that you're going to start?

**01:15:13** And so it like, it forces me to always reevaluate at the end of each work unit. What's the next

**01:15:21** thing that I'm going to do? So it's just interesting to me that like, that's what time

**01:15:24** tracking has evolved into is a tool of intentionality. And it's like, you know, you've

**01:15:31** reported on like how you've spent your time each year. And I just don't really have any interest

**01:15:36** in that data for myself, except in like the most broad of and brief kind of ways. But I don't

**01:15:44** really use it as a planning tool. I use something else for that, which we can talk about later. But

**01:15:48** so that's the way it works for me. I do think that that is a very valid part of time tracking too,

**01:15:53** right? Of like helping you set the expectation in your mind for what you're doing at any certain

**01:15:59** time. I am sitting down to work now. I think that that is a very important part of it.

**01:16:05** Or even like for the why do I run timers for the rest of things is even just like deciding to relax.

**01:16:14** And I was like, oh, the day's over. What am I doing? I'm sitting on the couch and I'm watching

**01:16:18** a movie with my wife. Like click the timer starts. Like this is what I'm deciding to do. Great.

**01:16:23** The day's over. And I like that as make a conscious decision. Don't just drift from task

**01:16:30** to task. So that's what I like. But I just realized I assume that you're still using toggle,

**01:16:35** but I haven't asked you in a while. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I use toggle was merely

**01:16:41** a backend service for the timer. The third party app that I love that uses toggles data

**01:16:48** and timers, but it's an iOS app that is just fantastic. And then on the Mac, I use the toggle

**01:16:55** app, which is terrible, but gets the job done. But that's what I use. Right. And then of course,

**01:17:00** we both have some shortcuts that we've created that allow just being able to set things easily.

**01:17:06** And I use timer ease shortcuts that they've created to add into existing shortcuts that I make

**01:17:12** to make that stuff sing. But yet toggles service is good. It's pretty rock solid. I like that. It

**01:17:18** also has the ability to create an account that can have team information in it. My sales manager,

**01:17:25** we have them track their time through toggle, which is useful for them because then they can

**01:17:30** use that to, to bill us. That is a useful part of time tracking. If you are self-employed

**01:17:36** and you bill people based on the time that you work, this is the best way to get that in that

**01:17:42** data is to actually track the time that you're doing. Cause you're really tracking what you're

**01:17:45** doing. Right. And most of these applications, including toggle will allow you to create a report

**01:17:50** based on that information to help you do the billing that you need to do. Neither of us

**01:17:55** bill anyone, right? We don't use billing, but there is sort of one exception to looking at the data,

**01:17:59** which I use. So this is just a little, little suggestion if someone wants to use it this way.

**01:18:04** So toggle allows you to have this additional setting, which is they want it for like billable

**01:18:10** hours, but I use the billable hours toggle as time that I highly value. So this is either the

**01:18:20** core stuff like writing and researching a script, but I'll also use it for exercise time. And so I

**01:18:27** am always thinking of like billable hours in their little system just are tracked completely separately.

**01:18:33** And so I always feel like I wanted, I do in a particular day, always want to kind of hit

**01:18:38** a certain number of hours where I feel like these are all the high value activities. So that's like

**01:18:45** the writing it's the exercise. It's certain kinds of reading those three things like, you know,

**01:18:51** these are the best ways that I can spend my working time. So they're not billable hours,

**01:18:55** but I do love that toggle does pull those things out and I can quickly see like,

**01:19:00** I sort of don't care about the whole day, but I do care about these numbers. Like these numbers

**01:19:05** combined should always be like at a certain point. Interesting. Yeah, that's how I use the billable

**01:19:11** hours. I would have thought to do that. I wouldn't use that, but I can see it being a thing that you

**01:19:17** could use from a setup perspective. For me, I actually have a pretty similar arrangement to how

**01:19:25** my to do system is by design. So when you set a time tracker, you can give it a description.

**01:19:30** So you can type in free form what you're doing, and then you can add projects and tags. Now,

**01:19:37** I only use projects and tags. I never feel like I need to write a description of what I'm doing.

**01:19:42** And I basically set it up that my projects are the things in my life that I work on.

**01:19:49** And by and large, they are named the same as the projects in my to do list. Right. So in to do list,

**01:19:56** I'm not like laying this data over one or the other, but it just helps me just mentally keep

**01:20:01** track of what's being worked on because I don't have to think about like, what do I call it in

**01:20:05** to do as versus what do I call it in toggle? Right. So like, you know, I'll have like sponsors,

**01:20:10** I'll have show prep and all that kind of stuff. It's probably time for me to review these. I would

**01:20:15** like to actually pair them down a little bit more. And then I also use tags and the tags are the

**01:20:21** names of the shows that I'm on because if I am using the podcast recording or podcast editing

**01:20:27** project, that is almost useless for me unless I'm saying what show it is that I'm doing.

**01:20:32** Right. Because you want to be able to pull out the data per show.

**01:20:35** Yeah, because that can differ wildly because like I don't edit every show that I'm on.

**01:20:40** So if I just had podcast editing and podcast recording, those numbers would be completely wrong.

**01:20:45** Right. Because I would be making like, oh, for every minute I record, I am editing for this

**01:20:50** many minutes where like that's not technically accurate. Yeah. Right. So I like to assign the

**01:20:57** shows to it because then I can also drill that down later on as well to be like, okay, so

**01:21:02** how many hours have I worked on Cortex versus upgrade this year? And again, that can work out

**01:21:08** the end of the year, right? Like how much money did I make from each of those shows? And then if

**01:21:11** I want to make decisions on those shows, then I can. Right. So it's like, that's why I like this

**01:21:16** data is because it helps me make decisions. I don't do that often, but I've done it on a few

**01:21:22** occasions and it has helped me come to an answer that I otherwise couldn't do. So like I do find

**01:21:28** having this data is useful, but the main reason I do it is just so I can, I really deal with this,

**01:21:34** this information in the macro, which one is which micro is small, macro is large.

**01:21:40** Then I deal with these things in the micro. Okay. Because I always think of macro lens,

**01:21:44** macro lens, like should take pictures of things that are close up. That's where I get confused.

**01:21:48** Yeah. Cause the, yeah. Cause the lens is big. Let's you see things.

**01:21:51** All right. But like the result is something that's small anyway, right? But do you understand? I know,

**01:21:57** I know I'm wrong here. I obviously, but do you understand how I get that wrong?

**01:22:00** Totally confusing. You're not, you're not wrong to be confused at all. Yeah. A macro lens is a

**01:22:05** terrible name for it. I am typically using the, this data to make decisions about like,

**01:22:10** how did I feel today? Like you really like it's more like today, but I then have this pool of

**01:22:16** data that exists that I can draw conclusions from if I want to. Um, how do you set up your projects

**01:22:24** and tags system with your time tracking? So now this is where I'm just the total opposite because

**01:22:29** my time tracking system is I only use the top level, like tags and stuff. I've never touched it.

**01:22:36** Descriptions never written a description. Yeah. See, I've never written a description either. So

**01:22:40** you're just using like projects. Here's the thing. I'm using projects and the reason I use projects

**01:22:46** is because you can have them show up as different colors in the little pie chart that.

**01:22:50** Oh, I love that. The colors is so important. Yeah. And so for the videos trying to

**01:22:56** hour track the particular videos is not really useful. I know I tried it briefly for a while,

**01:23:04** but I was like, this is dumb. This is not really helpful. I don't actually, because of the way my

**01:23:08** video production process is like, I just don't really care about how many hours were spent on

**01:23:15** one project versus the other. Like there, there just isn't actionable information for me in the

**01:23:21** same way because those projects are largely defined by how interesting I think they potentially are.

**01:23:26** And it's like if something's interesting and it's going to take a million hours, like, well,

**01:23:30** that's the way I make the videos. And there's nothing actionable going forward with that.

**01:23:35** So that's why I only track in extremely broad ways of like I'm writing, but I don't have sub tags for

**01:23:41** which project is this or I'm doing video editing right now and I don't do sub tracking for that.

**01:23:48** For me, the main thing with the time tracking is the colors are really vital. So it's like

**01:23:55** I use dark blue for the high value work time and I use light blue for things like administrative

**01:24:04** tasks or, you know, like email or any of that kind of stuff. I use my least favorite color,

**01:24:10** purple. What do you got against purple? It's just, it's not a nice color, but I use purple

**01:24:15** specifically for what I think of as like transition periods that need to happen, but are also kind of

**01:24:22** danger zones. So it's just like when you wake up in the morning, how long is it before you actually

**01:24:29** start working? Right? So like I have a little timer and it's called boot up. It's like when I

**01:24:33** wake up in the morning, like I hit the boot up timer and that starts adding like this ugly purple

**01:24:38** to the timer of my day. And so it provides like a little incentive always of like you want the

**01:24:43** least amount of purple. So those kinds of like have to get done, but are not intrinsically

**01:24:49** valuable in and of themselves transition tasks. I'll use that way or colors that are like for

**01:24:54** free time stuff is a lot of yellow or green. And so this is where like I really like being able to

**01:25:00** see the colors because I can just have a very quick sense of how the day is going. And I find it

**01:25:08** quite motivating to be like keep the colors that you like or that represent good things in your

**01:25:13** life large and keep the colors for things that are not good as small as possible. The most

**01:25:19** dreaded color on my calendar is black, which is for unintentional time. And that's where if I've

**01:25:25** started a timer, but for whatever reason, I don't actually do the thing that the timer said like,

**01:25:32** oh, I need to, I need to research some facts about this project, but I got distracted by Reddit.

**01:25:37** It's like, Oh no, once I realized I've been distracted by Reddit, it's two hours later

**01:25:42** and I've been looking at like power washing videos. I've got to go to that timer and you

**01:25:47** can just quickly change the project. And so I'll change that project name to like

**01:25:51** unintentionally, which means like you didn't do the thing you intended to do. And this is like the

**01:25:56** worst way to spend your time. So that's how I use those colors on a like on a daily basis. But

**01:26:02** I'm not very specific with the details of like which project is related to what like I just don't

**01:26:09** find that useful or actionable for me. I get it. Cause I've heard you mention it a few times. It

**01:26:13** does always make me chuckle about the idea of tracking unintentionally used time. Cause it's

**01:26:18** like, how do I know I'm doing it? And I know you do it after the fact, right? Like, yeah,

**01:26:22** but it's still, it's still like a funny, it's just like a funny thought, right? Like if someone

**01:26:26** just coming cold to that, be like, how did you track time where you weren't paying attention?

**01:26:31** How do you do it? I get why it's funny, but I really think it's actually one of the most

**01:26:36** vital parts for me. This is why like always run a timer, make some things really easy. And for

**01:26:42** catching yourself when you've gone off track, this is super easy because you can look at the timer

**01:26:48** that says writing and realize, oh, wait a minute. I'm still like puttering around because I actually

**01:26:56** realized I needed to fill up the coffee and I didn't get started. And then like, so now I can

**01:27:01** just say like, oh, this was unintentional time. Like this was, this was epic fail. And I know

**01:27:06** exactly how long I spent not doing the thing that I intended to do. And I have to say like by doing

**01:27:12** that over the years, I've definitely gotten much, much better about the intentionality of like,

**01:27:18** what am I doing right now? Like I have to use that less and less. And I think it's because

**01:27:22** it provides that feedback of like, I don't want to have to put black on this calendar.

**01:27:27** So what am I doing? And if I'm realizing like, I'm not in the mood to get this high quality

**01:27:34** task done, I'm going to make a decision. Okay, you know what? I'm going to read a book for a while,

**01:27:40** or I'm going to watch some YouTube videos. And I track that time differently of like,

**01:27:45** I've intentionally decided to do this other thing. And that's way better than unintentionally just

**01:27:53** doing it. Because I feel like that decision is really important. But again, like that, this is,

**01:27:58** this is the way that I'm using the time tracking is like this decision aiding tool. I will say if

**01:28:03** someone does want to run a lot of timers, my suggestion here, if you're using iOS is,

**01:28:08** I have the same stack that Mike does, you know, toggle, I'm using timer as the interface for toggle.

**01:28:16** But the primary reason I'm using timer is because it has amazing integration with shortcuts. But

**01:28:21** here's here's here's like the great pro tip on time tracking. I make shortcuts for all of the

**01:28:27** various timers that I want to run. And what you can do in shortcuts is turn every shortcut into a

**01:28:37** like a little app, a little pseudo app on the phone. So you can say like make the shortcut exist on my

**01:28:42** home screen. And I just put all of those little pseudo apps in a folder on my phone, so they just

**01:28:48** disappear. But when I go to time track, I always do it on the phone and I swipe down on the phone

**01:28:56** to pull up that little search bar. And you know how iOS has the suggested apps that you should

**01:29:02** use at any particular time. Because you now have all of your little timers are pseudo apps,

**01:29:09** I've found that iOS actually gets pretty good at guessing which timer do you want to run when.

**01:29:17** That is clever.

**01:29:18** Yeah. So I would say like probably at this point, 90 percent of the time if I pull down on the phone

**01:29:26** to like pretend like I'm going to search, one of the top three pseudo apps is the timer that I want

**01:29:32** to run at that moment. And so it's great. There's only a couple of other like timers that I use super

**01:29:37** frequently that I put in the little widget to slide over with timer. But that's what I do for

**01:29:42** running like a bunch of timers if you also want to be the sort of person who's always running

**01:29:46** timers. So that works really well for me. And something that I like about timer unit shortcut

**01:29:51** support is you then have the ability to add that into the flow of another shortcut. So for example,

**01:29:58** I have a shortcut that's called show prep. And when I tap it, it asks me what show are you preparing

**01:30:03** for. So I would tap say cortex, and it will open the cortex Google Doc for me and also set a time

**01:30:12** tracker for preparing for cortex. Or I have another one which I run to just like get my phone

**01:30:20** ready for when I'm recording. So like set on do not disturb and stuff like that. Make sure the

**01:30:24** volumes down all those things. But it will also look at my calendar and set a recording timer

**01:30:32** with the tag, the name of the next upcoming event on my calendar. And I have the events named just

**01:30:40** right. So it will say for example, upgrade is just the name of the calendar event, I don't need

**01:30:47** it to be anything more than that. So then it just adds the tag of the word upgrade, which is the same

**01:30:52** as the tag in my time tracker. So it can just pull that data in, throw it into the tag field,

**01:30:57** and then it's all set. So little stuff like that. You play around with it. But I like that. So I

**01:31:03** like building my time trackers in as just automatic parts of a shortcut, which will enable me to

**01:31:10** do the work that I'm trying to do at the moment. So I like that. This episode of Cortex is brought

**01:31:16** to you by ExpressVPN. Working from home, you might not be thinking about internet privacy since

**01:31:20** you're on your home network, right? We all know that Incognito Windows exists. But did you know

**01:31:25** that even in Incognito mode, your online activity could still be traced. Even if you clear your

**01:31:30** online browsing history, your ISP, your internet service provider could see every single website

**01:31:34** you've ever visited. That is why you may want to use ExpressVPN to make sure that your ISP

**01:31:40** and nobody can see what sites you're visiting. Instead, your internet connection is rerouted

**01:32:05** of my favorite features about ExpressVPN, I have two actually. One, how fast it is to turn on,

**01:32:14** It's not like everything gets super slow. And I can also switch my location to enjoy content

**01:32:19** from other regions. And the fact that I am able to stream video in HD while using ExpressVPN just

**01:32:56** and Relay FM. Communication. So we spoke about email, but you know, there's more communication

**01:33:03** in email. There's been a lot of communication apps that have been created to try and get rid

**01:33:06** of email. Right. I mean, Slack is the main thing here, I think for work communication.

**01:33:12** Then you've got messaging apps, right? So I messaged that kind of thing is like another part.

**01:33:18** But the only reason I really wanted to talk about the communication apps today is to highlight

**01:33:24** something that you imparted upon me, which has been very useful in many of my creative projects

**01:33:32** with people that are also my friends, which is conversation silos. So I really just wanted to

**01:33:38** mention this again today as like an important thing to think about as a like productivity

**01:33:43** philosophy thing, especially if you work with somebody that you also have a friendship with,

**01:33:48** which I think is something that lots of people are doing more and more these days.

**01:33:52** And that is the idea of having multiple places where you talk to the same person,

**01:33:57** but you talk about work in one place and everything else in another. So for me and

**01:34:03** Gray, we have now three places where we talk. So we have iMessage where by and large iMessage

**01:34:12** is we just talk like friends and less. And we're both pretty good at this. Like if something is

**01:34:18** urgent, we know we can reach each other always by iMessage. Right. Right. So like, for example,

**01:34:25** if when we record today, I need if I needed to start editing immediately and it's two

**01:34:30** hours later and I don't have your audio, the place that I'm going to message you is iMessage,

**01:34:34** because it's urgent communication and it's most like I would expect you're most likely to be

**01:34:39** looking at iMessage than Slack. Right. But by and large for all work stuff related to the show,

**01:34:46** we will talk in the Relay FM Slack. And then we also have a Slack for Cortex brand,

**01:34:51** which is everything else related to our business together. Yes. Yes. And the value in having these

**01:34:57** silos is it means that work and personal do not get intermixed of each other. And to maintain a

**01:35:07** friendship when you work with someone, I find this incredibly important to make sure that you're

**01:35:13** keeping those things separated so that you can have those spaces that are safe. I think one of

**01:35:18** the importance of siloing is you don't want to get an iMessage from your friend, but before you're

**01:35:25** able to see the text preview or whatever of the message to start to get a Pavlovian response of,

**01:35:32** oh, is there some problem with the work? Right. Or is there something that I like I need to handle

**01:35:36** right now? And so by for the most part, keeping the conversations separate, you avoid that constant

**01:35:45** intermingling. And I also think it's good because it allows you to be able to have a business

**01:35:52** conversation in the business environment that leaves your friendship at the door. And you can

**01:35:58** just say like, okay, we got to make some decisions about this thing. And I think it's really good to

**01:36:02** be able to separate those different aspects of like, what is the relationship between these two

**01:36:07** people? Because it can get quite muddled up. So yeah, I'm always in favor of siloing conversations

**01:36:13** if possible. With communication systems, you know, there are a lot of tools, I think this always ends

**01:36:18** up being very specific to the person and what their communication is like. So I don't have a

**01:36:24** lot to say on here, except yeah, just be intentional about which tool are you going to use for which kind

**01:36:31** of communication. This is not as deep as the other things in this show. But like that piece of

**01:36:37** information I really find to be quite important to people working today, because this can be like

**01:36:43** with your colleagues is very normal to become friends with people that you work with. Yeah,

**01:36:48** just keep that work conversation outside of your usual messaging app. Right. Like talk about the

**01:36:54** other stuff that you have in common rather than did you finish the report? Yeah, keep that keep

**01:36:59** that in email, keep that in Slack or whatever. I mean, Slack continues to be the only other real

**01:37:04** business communication tool that I have. Slack continues to grow into this beast of a thing.

**01:37:12** Yeah, but it's great. Like, you know, it's Slack is like, it suffers from it not necessarily being

**01:37:19** bad in any way, but people just start to associate what's in it with the application. Yeah. You know,

**01:37:25** everyone loves Slack when it first came around because it was different and then they were

**01:37:29** creating like communities within it. So it's like, Oh, I love it because it's got this community

**01:37:33** aspect to it. But then your employer picked it up and then it became the place where work happens.

**01:37:38** And then you're just less excited about it. Well, yeah, I also think Slack has one feature that I

**01:37:44** think is particularly guilty of removing siloing and kind of muddying the waters of the Slack.

**01:37:50** And that's their general channel. And I think for even in many like business focused slacks,

**01:37:58** the general place can become a real hotbed of nonsense that is also like where friends are

**01:38:06** chatting, but this is also the place where we work. I can't imagine what a general room in a

**01:38:11** corporate Slack must look like. Yeah, it must look like madness. The way I have actually set up the

**01:38:17** Slack that I use for all of the video and all of my related work, I've disabled the general channel.

**01:38:24** Like there is no general conversation because I really do want to try to keep it very strict of

**01:38:31** like, okay, guys, we've got channels for projects. And like this channel is where we discuss like

**01:38:39** what needs to be done for this project. And if there's something that's not directly related

**01:38:44** to a project, like that's what direct messages are for. I'm the like this grumpy person who's

**01:38:49** like, I don't want reaction gifts. Like I don't want all these other things. Like, let's be very

**01:38:54** clear. Like this is where we're trying to get this project brought close to completion. And I just,

**01:39:00** I often think like that general channel. I don't know. Like I think that's why people were like,

**01:39:06** oh, Slack is so fun because there's this built in room where we can just like hang out with our

**01:39:11** friends as like, but yeah, you probably shouldn't be hanging out with your friends in Slack. You

**01:39:15** should probably find some other method for that because then now you're mixing like work and

**01:39:20** friendship in a weird way sometimes. I think this was just as it changed, right? So like for a lot

**01:39:25** of people when Slack first came around, it was like, there is a community of people here, right?

**01:39:32** Like there is a group of people around a certain type of thing, right? Like when it first was

**01:39:39** coming onto the scene, I think it was more like we're a large group of friends. This gives us

**01:39:44** somewhere to hang out together, but it has become a tool which has been adopted by workplace because

**01:39:50** that's actually what it's for. So Discord has come in and I think has picked up a lot of the community

**01:39:57** stuff. And Discord is similarly structured. It has its general rooms or whatever, but I think people,

**01:40:03** and I know I feel differently about Discord because it is more just like community than

**01:40:10** work. Yeah. And let's talk about calendars. I have a very simple calendar philosophy. Events

**01:40:18** go on the calendar, like things that are going to happen and end at a certain time, they go on the

**01:40:22** calendar. I have a bunch of calendars, like work calendars, personal calendars, shared calendars.

**01:40:28** I don't have a very complicated calendar structure. Every event has a like a notification five minutes

**01:40:37** before, just because I like that. I feel like my calendaring is very typical. You may have a

**01:40:43** simple calendar system, but I feel like you have a lot of events on that calendar. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**01:40:47** I have lots and lots of events. Yes. But I don't feel like it's different to like the calendar I

**01:40:53** kept when I had a regular job, like the calendar when I, because it was full of meetings. Right. So

**01:40:59** similar for me, like just recordings and calls and meetings replaced the meetings. Like it was all

**01:41:06** just blocks of time, but I don't really do anything particularly different, I feel, to the average

**01:41:13** person who uses a calendar. But I know that you have some different uses for your calendars. Like

**01:41:20** you have specific calendars that you only look at specific times. So I think that's where I'm

**01:41:25** different. Like all of my calendars are enabled. Yeah, I am very much not a, not a, you know,

**01:41:30** talking about the spectrum at the beginning. Like I don't use the calendar in the way that

**01:41:34** many people do. In some ways, the calendar for me has two totally separate and unrelated functions.

**01:41:40** The one function is for my one calendar that I call changes, which basically means

**01:41:47** any interruptions in what would otherwise be my totally internal life, right? Of like, oh,

**01:41:53** here is a meeting that you need to go to, or there's going to be a conference this week,

**01:41:59** or you have to do a call with this person at this time. And so like I have this one calendar

**01:42:05** that just shows all of the time-based items that are different from just what would be my normal

**01:42:14** ideal week, just on my own minding my own business. And so in that way, my calendar is

**01:42:20** ridiculously simple because I also try extremely hard to limit how many items are ever going to

**01:42:27** be on that calendar. It's mostly a tool for things like, you know, if I need to do a call about

**01:42:34** something, I try to look at the calendar and then put the calls all on the same day because I'll

**01:42:39** feel like, oh, as soon as a day has something like a dentist appointment, that whole day is

**01:42:44** ruined. So I might as well like stack a bunch of calls or other stuff on that day. And like,

**01:42:51** that's the way I use it. Yeah. So like, this is like that funny thing for me where it's like,

**01:42:55** oh, I have an empty day. Fill it up of calls, right? Like that's, you know, it's this sad thing

**01:43:00** that I ended up doing to myself where I'm like so excited about there being an empty day next week.

**01:43:05** And then someone says, Oh, Hey, can we have a call? And I'm like, Oh, I have an empty day.

**01:43:08** I'll just put one call in here. And then they like three calls get stacked on that because

**01:43:13** once I add one call, it's no longer the empty day anymore. Right. Then for it, say,

**01:43:18** full up with calls day. Yeah. So for me, my ideal calendar, like, if I look at a week, I want to have

**01:43:24** zero items on that changes calendar. Like I don't want to see like, Oh, there's a dinner that you

**01:43:29** have to go to with this thing. It's like, Nope, I want none of that. Like that's always what I'm

**01:43:33** trying to arrange. Right? Because any added event to the changes calendar is going to start the

**01:43:37** cascade. I feel like it changes the whole feeling of a day. Like I just hate, I hate knowing like,

**01:43:42** Oh, I've got to be at that place tonight. Right. And it's like, as soon as I wake up in the morning,

**01:43:47** I know it's coming. So yeah, I try, I try very hard to live with what's on that, what's on that

**01:43:53** calendar. So in some ways, the way a normal person uses a calendar, I have one calendar and it's and

**01:44:00** just events go on that and I try very hard to keep it nice and simple. But the other way that I do use

**01:44:06** the calendar, which I don't know, I probably do like two or three times a year. And I actually

**01:44:13** just did it last week is as a theoretical planning tool. So I will sometimes sit down and say,

**01:44:23** Okay, you know, I've, I've been doing this long enough. And I do know from my daily numbers,

**01:44:30** like I have a sense of how many hours can you spend writing on a good day or like,

**01:44:37** how much exercise do you want to do, you know, on average over the course of this week? And then,

**01:44:43** like, how many times do you have a podcast to record? How long does that podcast take to edit?

**01:44:50** And I start to put all of those items on a calendar because a week isn't quite right. I do

**01:44:55** this over a 14 day time period. And I'll build up what I think of as the theoretically perfect

**01:45:03** time period. And it's much more that which I use to try to make decisions about what do I want to

**01:45:12** do? Or what do I not want to do? Or if I'm going to take on a new project, where does that project

**01:45:19** fit in here? Like, what am I going to take time from? And how much downtime do I want to have? Or,

**01:45:27** you know, like reading is an important thing for me, but I always kind of put it off. Where should

**01:45:32** reading go in my life on like, what I would imagine to be like, Oh, this would be two weeks. And if I

**01:45:39** followed this calendar perfectly, I would feel like I could not have done better in life. And

**01:45:46** I think people will hear this. And what they'll hear is that I've scheduled my time, but that's

**01:45:53** not really correct because I'm not a calendar person. I'm not using this as here is the regime

**01:46:00** that I must follow. It's much more of just an evaluation of you only have so many quality

**01:46:08** hours in the day. There's only so many things that can be done. And just seeing how does this fit to

**01:46:16** work together over a longer period of time. And this I find just a really useful process. And like

**01:46:23** the broad outlines of it doesn't really change all that much because, you know, I know the rhythm of

**01:46:29** my own life that I'm most productive in the very early morning and in the evening time and like

**01:46:35** afternoons are sort of a more difficult downtime. And like, I know these rhythms, but it's really

**01:46:42** just thinking about what am I focusing my time on to do this theoretically perfect week. And I

**01:46:50** always find that an incredibly valuable thing to do. And especially like with recently, how there

**01:46:58** are many things that will have impacted my theoretical schedule to sit down and be like,

**01:47:04** okay, let me think through going forward, what do I want the weeks to look like? And so I don't do

**01:47:11** that often, but that is where I use the calendar as a kind of time planning tool. And I don't stick

**01:47:20** to it. It's not a regime. I've never found the whole like set a schedule for yourself advice to

**01:47:27** be useful. My brain just does not work that way, which is why I use more task focused system. But I

**01:47:33** do like using the calendar for that. And then just on a more minor scale, a thing that you and I were

**01:47:38** doing before we started the call today is there is a more actionable version of this where I have

**01:47:43** a calendar where I'm keeping track of when are things going to be posted and what's going on in

**01:47:50** the world. So having a rough sense of like, you know, when do I think the next video is going to

**01:47:58** go up? And you know, when is a Cortex episode going to go up? Or what else is going on in my life

**01:48:04** around those times or like what holiday is it or all these kinds of things? So I do have a sort of

**01:48:11** broad posting planning kind of schedule, but obviously because of the way I work,

**01:48:18** none of those things are certain, but it's still useful to be able to try to keep things from

**01:48:24** overlapping too much or just being aware of, oh, there's a big event that's planned for this week.

**01:48:29** That's probably not a time where you can even conceive that you're going to post something. So

**01:48:33** that's the other way that I use a calendar. From a calendar tool perspective, I'm all about

**01:48:39** Fantastic. Yeah. Is there any other tool that's useful if you have an even moderately complicated

**01:48:44** calendaring system? No, the Fantastic. Cal is like the one true calendar app. And that's the one I

**01:48:50** use to for sure. I'm a big, big fan of it. They have all of the features that I'm looking for.

**01:48:55** I've really been happy with the newest version, like with the new iPad app and stuff like it's

**01:49:01** great. It's so good. It's really, really very good. And it works wonderfully with the trackpad

**01:49:06** support. I think it's wonderful. I'm very, very happy. Yeah. I mean, there's nothing else to even

**01:49:11** discuss like Fantastic. Cal or GTFO. Don't you use Apple Calendar for some stuff though? Or have you

**01:49:17** changed that? I know that you were using it. The only reason I used to use Apple Calendar is because

**01:49:21** Fantastic. Cal didn't support the groups on iOS, right? Like the calendar groups where you can

**01:49:27** switch back and forth. And so I used Apple Calendar. I set it a particular way to be an

**01:49:32** alternate group that I could quickly look at. But now that Fantastic. Cal has the calendar

**01:49:37** groups that you can toggle on and off on iOS. Like I have no need for Apple Calendar. Goodbye.

**01:49:42** I'll never see you again. So that was, I guess, productivity 101, right? Like we're done now.

**01:49:48** That's all of it. Everyone can go ahead. Just go be productive now. We've given you everything we

**01:49:52** know. It feels like we did a lot of it. I think so. Like I feel like we have given the complete

**01:49:58** overview that I wanted to. On our next episode, we're going to move some of this stuff forward a

**01:50:04** little bit and also relate it to a video that you just produced called Spaceship You, which is

**01:50:10** really excellent. If you haven't seen this video yet, you should before the next episode. But I

**01:50:16** want to kind of talk a little bit more about that idea in general. And it's also kind of like

**01:50:21** relating to just working from home again, as like coming back to that. So I think there's some

**01:50:27** really interesting themes in there that I want to explore and also check in on how we're above

**01:50:32** doing. So go and watch that video. Link will be in the show notes and we'll talk about it next time.
