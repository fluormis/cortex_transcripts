# Cortex - 110: 2021 Yearly Themes
**00:00:00** Are you ready to say goodbye to 2020?

**00:00:02** You know, I'm not sure if I'm ready to say goodbye to 2020.

**00:00:07** You want to stick in it for a little bit longer? It's nice and comfortable in here.

**00:00:10** Yeah, I'm not going to immediately back that statement, Mike.

**00:00:13** Okay. Well, I'm going to join literally every single one of our listeners and wish goodbye to

**00:00:20** 2020. So goodbye, 2020. Manilian to 2021. The optimistic year.

**00:00:24** Goodbye, 2020.

**00:00:26** We hardly knew you.

**00:00:30** It's time. It's time for yearly themes.

**00:00:34** Yearly theme time. The best time of the year.

**00:00:36** It is really the best time of the year. Yearly themes for 2021. So we're looking ahead to our

**00:00:41** next year. I guess we should start off of a brief recap of what yearly themes are.

**00:00:47** My favorite thing that's happened since our last yearly themes episode is you made that wonderful

**00:00:51** YouTube video, the themes video. I will put that in the show notes. It's a very good primer for the

**00:00:56** idea of what a theme is, what it is like to have a yearly theme. But if you want a bit more

**00:01:02** information, we can go into that here. So we've been doing yearly themes on Cortex since 2016.

**00:01:09** Oh my God.

**00:01:09** Yeah. Don't think about it that way. It's fine. Every year we get together, we review how our

**00:01:15** last year has gone and the theme that we set for ourselves and talk about what we're looking to

**00:01:20** achieve in our coming year and then set a theme around that. So the things that we want to achieve

**00:01:26** where we want to be, what we want to focus on, we kind of encapsulate these things and

**00:01:31** tie them up with a nice little theme bow. Now yearly themes, they are not resolutions.

**00:01:37** Not at all. Resolutions should go in the trash. New Year's resolutions are a terrible idea.

**00:01:43** Do you want to tell people when New Year's resolutions are a terrible idea, Gray?

**00:01:47** I mean, where does one even start? But yes, they're goals that you set a year in advance

**00:01:54** that you often think about with mere days, if that, of forethought. And it's just like

**00:02:01** everything about them is structurally doomed to failure. I think themes exist as a nice

**00:02:08** general layer above goals. Goals, if you want them to exist, need to be shorter term than a year.

**00:02:16** It's just, it's way too far and it's depressing and it's awful. So no one should do New Year's

**00:02:21** resolutions.

**00:02:22** So I give you a good example to all listeners. So a lot of people might set a New Year's resolution

**00:02:27** of like, I want to lose 10 pounds by March or something like that. And these are like these

**00:02:32** fixed goals that you can succeed or fail with. But if you set for yourself, for example, the year of

**00:02:37** health as your yearly theme, there's so many things that you can achieve over that 12 month period

**00:02:43** that could contribute to the year of health rather than it just being like, well, I didn't lose those

**00:02:48** 10 pounds. I lost eight, so I failed. Right. It's like, no, but if you have the yearly theme of the

**00:02:53** year of health, you did what you wanted to do, or maybe your year of health could be focusing on

**00:03:00** your mental health instead because you decide that you don't want to lose the weight. So there are

**00:03:04** lots of different things that you can do that could ladder up to the year of health. That makes it

**00:03:10** more of a thing that at the end of the year, you can look back and see what you've accomplished

**00:03:14** rather than focusing on the things that you didn't. Yeah. And they're adaptable and flexible as you go

**00:03:20** on because as might happen, a year could be quite different halfway in than you were expecting at

**00:03:28** the start. And then you also would just feel bad of like, oh, I'm never going to achieve my goal.

**00:03:33** It's like, no, no, themes can be malleable. They can change to fit the situation. You just want to

**00:03:38** be moving in a positive direction. And if there's one thing that 2020 has taught us and all the

**00:03:43** cortex is that I think we need to establish our yearly themes in such a way that in case they can

**00:03:48** take a harsh left turn, but we'll talk about that in a little bit. Themes are intended to be broad,

**00:03:54** like getting better at something is great. You don't have to be the ultimate version of it. So

**00:04:00** like, there was one of the things that you were talking about in the video that you made of

**00:04:03** positive trend lines being a good thing. You know, this is like, as long as you're moving towards

**00:04:09** where you want to be, that is improvement. Just being at the ultimate stage of that is not

**00:04:14** necessarily what you can achieve. You don't know what's going to happen in your year.

**00:04:18** So having a theme can help you move towards areas that you're looking for rather than be like all

**00:04:25** or nothing based around one's particular metric that you've set. So when you're choosing a theme

**00:04:31** for yourself, try to stay broad. Don't make a defined route or path. Think about the kinds of

**00:04:36** areas that you'd like to focus on. Allow for adapting as you referenced it as broad directional

**00:04:42** resonant. These are these three little words that I really liked from the video that you made.

**00:04:47** So yearly themes, they're all about trying to help you build the life you want to live,

**00:04:51** whether it's personal stuff, work stuff, creative stuff, or a mix of all of them. And for the last

**00:04:56** few years, my themes have been exactly that. And my theme that I'm going to talk about later on in

**00:05:01** this episode for 2021 is I think one of the most all encapsulating themes that I have

**00:05:09** looked at so far. It touches on, I think, every single part of my work, creative and personal life

**00:05:16** in a way that they haven't usually. And so that's what I think, like a really good yearly theme,

**00:05:21** you can find parts of it in everything that you do. And I think that that really helps,

**00:05:28** again, enforce the idea of this being an achievable thing, because I may not achieve

**00:05:33** my yearly theme when it comes to the creativity stuff, but maybe I did with my personal life,

**00:05:38** more relationships. And so that's what makes these things really good. It remains like this

**00:05:43** overall kind of umbrella for your year. I'm very intrigued to find out what it is that your theme

**00:05:51** is going to be this year. You're really setting it up there. I know. It's foreshadowing. But we

**00:05:56** have a lot to do before we talk about what our themes are. We like to review our theme from the

**00:06:02** year before. So we take a look at what we set in 2020 at the beginning of the year, or it's like

**00:06:08** the end of 2019. And then we reflect on how it's been. I've already kind of done a bit of this

**00:06:13** this year, but we haven't done it for you. So can you give our listeners a reminder of what your

**00:06:19** 2020 theme was and then talk about how it's been? Yes, I will do that. Just as soon as I change the

**00:06:26** batteries in my backup recorder. Hold on one second, Mike. How good is the backup recorder if it has no power?

**00:06:34** The backup recorder that I watched the little light blink out as you were talking and thought,

**00:06:38** oh no. You're doing fairly the one thing you're supposed to do. I'll be right back. Levels, levels.

**00:06:47** Okay. Okay. Okay.

**00:06:56** All right.

**00:06:57** Okay. All right.

**00:06:57** All right. Back up recorder, back up.

**00:06:59** Oh, dear.

**00:07:00** So, yeah, you were in the interesting position of doing the half-year theme switch at Cortex-first

**00:07:06** this year. Yep. Yep.

**00:07:07** I did not do a theme switch this year, and I'll say at this point, usually the weird thing that

**00:07:14** happens is we record this episode in December, and this is the time when people are thinking

**00:07:21** about New Year's resolutions. Every year in the past, I've always felt like summer is the time

**00:07:28** that you have to decide on what your theme is going to be. And it comes to you. Sometimes the

**00:07:33** theme picks you, you know, this happens. And so, I think that's a good thing. I think it's a good

**00:07:40** thing. Sometimes the theme picks you, you know, this happens. And so, often when we're talking

**00:07:46** about what the themes are, I'm already half-reviewing how it's gone because I've been

**00:07:52** living the theme for half of the year. Yep.

**00:07:54** And we've always been off-kilter, but this is the first year where that has not happened. So,

**00:08:01** I did not have my summer decision of what the theme is going to be. I was wondering for a little

**00:08:07** while of like, gee, I wonder if this is even going to be a thing that occurs to me because

**00:08:13** since this year was so different, it didn't feel quite like there was a summer and everything was

**00:08:18** just in a different place. So, this year I actually, for the first time, have had a theme run

**00:08:25** for the full duration. So, basically 18 months from the summer when I first thought of the

**00:08:31** year of clarity, which was my theme for last year until now. And so, I'll say, I had to put this,

**00:08:43** as the intro alluded to, Mike, 2020 has not been a good year for most people. I think we can make

**00:08:52** that as a general statement. Yeah, I think you could probably get away with that one, Gray.

**00:08:56** I don't like to generalize. But if I'm going to generalize on something, it will be this.

**00:09:01** Yeah. And specifically, when you're going to try to make a generalization that say encompasses

**00:09:08** the entirety of the human species on the planet for a year, there's very few things you could say.

**00:09:14** But to say that 2020 was not very many people's best year, it's probably a pretty safe statement.

**00:09:22** And for me, my 2020 got totally interrupted. It was originally going to be lots of travel

**00:09:30** and lots of family travel in particular, and all of that got canceled. But if we put aside

**00:09:40** all of the obvious things, and I'm just talking about myself, 2020 has been one of the greatest

**00:09:48** years of my adult life. And I will very easily attribute that to just a perfect alignment of

**00:09:58** theme and events. So I feel incredibly grateful to having the year of clarity to help in what would

**00:10:10** otherwise have been just like a really uncertain time. Yeah, you were set up perfectly. Yeah. To

**00:10:17** maximize everything you wanted, because there was nothing in your way. Yeah, that's a good point.

**00:10:23** That's a good point that there was nothing in my way in very many cases. And I think also it just,

**00:10:30** it really helped me just focus a lot on what is important, what matters, what actions can you take,

**00:10:39** like all of the obvious stuff, but just repeatedly thinking about the clarity of decision making,

**00:10:46** or what is it that you're trying to accomplish here? It really did work tremendously in my

**00:10:52** favor. And it's a strange thing to say, because again, within this context of, oh, 2020 has been

**00:11:00** fantastic, and the year of clarity is amazing. It's in the background of, oh, I haven't socialized

**00:11:08** with another human in person for almost a year, and I haven't been in a store or a restaurant of

**00:11:15** any kind. I don't think we have gone so long about seeing each other. Yeah. I mean, that has to be

**00:11:20** true. What will be a year, right? About now, I think I last saw you on New Year's Eve. Yeah,

**00:11:25** I think that's right. Yeah. I saw you last in person New Year's Eve. And yeah, I only saw a

**00:11:30** couple of people after that and it was like, well, goodbye, everybody. Goodbye, everyone. I'll see

**00:11:36** you later. So yeah, it's been an interesting experience. And I'm also just in this uncomfortable

**00:11:42** position of feeling guilty about that, but it is just the truth. I'll tell you, Gray, it's good you

**00:11:49** do because, you know, if you said all of this stuff and just felt nothing, it's bad. At least

**00:11:57** you're being able to acknowledge that, like, yeah, you've had been able to focus and have a good year,

**00:12:01** but you're obviously very aware of the fact that it's also a terrible year for pretty much everyone.

**00:12:06** If you didn't feel guilty about having had a productive year, in that sense, it's like,

**00:12:11** oh man, he's finally pushed, gone over the edge. Yeah. And it's also, you know, it's been an

**00:12:18** interesting experience just talking to other people where just, you know, sometimes you have

**00:12:22** to calibrate, like, you know, many people I know are having terrible times. And then it's like,

**00:12:26** well, you know, you want to keep it to yourself in those moments about like, oh, really? Everything's

**00:12:31** great within this tiny radius in which I exist. But this is, this is here where it's like, okay,

**00:12:35** we're talking about how have our years actually gone. And this is just the truth of it for me.

**00:12:40** Although what I would say is it does feel like another piece of evidence on the pile for

**00:12:46** what is like the inevitable end game of my life being a completely disconnected recluse in a

**00:12:53** cabin somewhere who every once in a while packs a video onto the back of a mule to send into town

**00:13:00** to be uploaded to the internet. It does feel a bit like, yeah, you could totally live that life,

**00:13:06** dude. And it wouldn't be a problem. From the outside, it does look like you have had from

**00:13:11** an output level, a very productive 2020. Like, it has been very productive for you. And I assume

**00:13:17** the plans that you sent in place that we spoke about on the show,

**00:13:21** Topic Lock and all that kind of stuff, which came from the year of clarity, it seems it's from the

**00:13:25** outside, it seems to have really worked. Oh, yeah, totally. And this is where I want to again,

**00:13:31** pitch to people who are thinking about themes, the real power of amorphousness, and it's perfectly

**00:13:40** okay for themes to be fuzzy wuzzy. Like, they don't have to be really precise. And, you know,

**00:13:46** I listened to the last year's episode, you know, before this one, because it's so interesting to

**00:13:51** hear how you are in the past. And like, I know what that gray was planning. Like, I know all of

**00:13:58** the things that he wanted to do with this new clear vision and many of which involve travel

**00:14:06** and explicitly seeing people. And like, there were so many things that he wanted to do.

**00:14:10** And all of that got completely washed away. But this fuzziness of the theme allowed me to achieve

**00:14:19** many of the same things that I wanted to achieve, but just in what ended up being totally different

**00:14:24** ways. And yeah, I always talk about this idea for people like you want to be trying to build a life

**00:14:32** that you want to live. And, you know, in this past year, Year of Clarity helped me really focus on,

**00:14:38** okay, if your radius has been shrunk from I can go anywhere in the world to, you know, this apartment

**00:14:46** is my existence. What is living a life that you want to live mean in that context? And I took it

**00:14:54** very seriously. And this is why, you know, I got exercise equipment, you know, very early to try to

**00:15:02** establish this as a thing. And also thinking about the video production, it was really a case of,

**00:15:10** well, I'm going to dive into the projects that I'm working on. Like, I can focus on this

**00:15:18** completely and clearly in a different way than before. There's fewer distractions

**00:15:24** from the outside world, you know, who knows how long this is going to last. You know, you never

**00:15:30** know in any particular moment, but I could always use that as an advantage to focus. And the strange

**00:15:37** thing about the year of knowing that there's not even going to be the possibility of a social

**00:15:43** interruption does allow a kind of deeper focus on things. Like it has been interesting. And

**00:15:50** I think it's also been measurably successful. Like if you look at the uploads for the past 18 months

**00:15:59** versus the previous 18 months, like I've just put out a lot more videos over the course of that time.

**00:16:06** And I also think, you know, because what started off the year of clarity was

**00:16:12** changing the business model for the way that I make the videos. Yeah, you were set up nicely

**00:16:17** in that regard. Which then also just changes the way I think about the production of those videos.

**00:16:23** And so I don't want to just upload more. Like I also wanted to really focus on the things that I

**00:16:30** think are interesting in those videos. So focusing on things like the rewatchability or the

**00:16:36** interconnectedness and also understanding that I can trust that the core audience will give something

**00:16:44** a try, even if it's just like reading a spooky story or whatever. So I'm really pleased not just

**00:16:51** with, oh, there's been more videos over the past 18 months, but I'm also really pleased with

**00:16:59** the variance in those videos. They're more different from each other than in a previous

**00:17:05** 18 month period. And without a doubt, again, year of clarity has helped me kind of focus on that and

**00:17:12** realize like making and consistently working on the videos and uploading those videos is the thing

**00:17:22** that keeps me the most happy. And it is also the thing that has the biggest impact on the outside

**00:17:31** world. It's the, you know, it's the thing that the most people see by a huge margin. It's the

**00:17:37** thing that affects the business revenue so I can pay myself and I can pay all the people that I

**00:17:42** work with. So it's like clearly the epicenter of everything that I should be doing. And for me,

**00:17:50** it was really well timed to have a year where it's like thinking back to past Gray, I know that he

**00:17:57** wanted to do a bunch of new things, but I'm again, strangely grateful that I had a year that constrained

**00:18:04** me to focus on just the core of everything, which is the YouTube channel. So yeah, I mean,

**00:18:12** that's part of it. And then, I mean, just on the other half of it is I feel like I've come out of

**00:18:18** this corn time better than when I went into it. And that's professionally in terms of video

**00:18:24** production. And also just, I'm pretty sure I'm in the best physical shape of my life.

**00:18:29** I saw a picture of you the other day. Oh yeah.

**00:18:31** I agree. You look great. Thanks, Mike.

**00:18:34** You look really good. You look young. You look like you've gone backwards. I don't know what

**00:18:40** this thing has done to you, but yeah, you look great, man.

**00:18:44** Yeah. I took a painting, so I painted a portrait of myself that will get older as I get later.

**00:18:49** And so that's another thing I learned in my, you know, you got to pick up a hobby

**00:18:54** over a corn time and that's been one of mine. Finally, you found the link, right?

**00:18:58** Yeah, I found the link. But again, like that's a side effect of, and you can hear me in the

**00:19:05** previous year talking about it of really the pandemic and lockdown making me take exercise,

**00:19:16** the phrase I kept using is like deadly seriously. Like this is incredibly important. You can't blow

**00:19:23** it off and creating for myself a home gym. And there's a trick that I've done this year, which

**00:19:32** has I'm still, I'm still with you here, Mike. Like I don't like exercise. It's not fun,

**00:19:39** but what's different with this is in previous times, I've had exercise be a regular,

**00:19:47** regular, like part of my week and I've gone long stretches where I've, I've maintained exercise.

**00:19:53** But what I've done here is I've made exercise a part of my day in the same way that brushing my

**00:20:01** teeth is part of the day. And it's, I really think it's made a huge difference. And in particular,

**00:20:10** the thing that I've, I've done is I hate morning exercises. Like it's never worked for me that like,

**00:20:17** again, those people who get up and they're like, Oh, I'm going to run two miles before I

**00:20:21** start work. It's always a real sweat before. Yeah, exactly. Before starting the day.

**00:20:26** So yeah, but the thing that does work for me, which has turned it into no matter what happens

**00:20:33** in the day, you've made some progress on this. So I get up, I have my normal wake up routine,

**00:20:38** brush my teeth. And then before starting the writing work, I do one set of like one exercise

**00:20:48** and that's it. It's like seven minutes tops, but it's just one thing. And with the, with using

**00:20:55** weights, like I find that is genuinely effective, at least for that one muscle group. And I've been

**00:21:02** doing this, this daily one morning exercises. I think of it like every day for basically this

**00:21:10** entire time. And yeah, sometimes days get busy and I don't get to the full workout that I want to do

**00:21:18** later. But this, this has really, again, cemented this as part of my life. Like this is part of the

**00:21:24** wake up routine. It's just something that you do. The day hasn't really started yet. You can always

**00:21:31** take seven minutes in the morning to do one exercise. Like, you know, you're never that

**00:21:36** pressed for time. And, you know, this, this again fell out of having the time to really try to think

**00:21:46** about, okay, even when I'm at home and I have exercise equipment at home, what are the obstacles

**00:21:52** that get in the way of sometimes doing the exercise and feeling like I have solved this

**00:21:56** problem and I have now turned at least some portion of exercise into basically toothbrushing. So

**00:22:03** that's, I feel like this is, this is my review of, of the year of clarity. Never has a fuzzy

**00:22:09** wuzzy theme been better matched with circumstances. And I also don't expect that ever again will a

**00:22:18** theme be more well matched with circumstances in my entire life. I did want to ask you,

**00:22:23** obviously one of the big work milestones or markers in your year was our old friend,

**00:22:32** the T-coin incident. How did the year of clarity help you navigate that?

**00:22:36** Yeah, it totally was involved in that decision making process. Year of clarity also trickled down

**00:22:42** to some of the internal business stuff. So there were sort of like clarity sub-goals that I

**00:22:49** discussed with my assistant, you know, for what we wanted to do business wise. And again,

**00:22:53** which we've achieved really well together. But when the T-coin incident came up, this was also

**00:23:00** another one of these cases of, you know, especially in like the first 24 hours after I realized, oh,

**00:23:08** there's this catastrophic error in the, in the video. The question of how to handle that

**00:23:15** again is not immediately obvious. And it's also not clear because you're trying to make a judgment of

**00:23:21** how bad is this error? You know, how, what, what is the appropriate level of responding to this?

**00:23:28** And without a doubt, year of clarity, just, I thought about it a bunch and it just helped

**00:23:35** think about, sure, we could leave a comment and that would be mostly fine for just about everyone,

**00:23:42** about like, oh, the type of missile was wrong. But again, this is where things are just

**00:23:48** amorphous and fuzzy and year of clarity means something internally. But it felt totally right

**00:23:55** that the actual correct response was to drop everything and try to emergency rush a video

**00:24:01** describing the whole situation in two weeks. And I'm really glad we did that. You know,

**00:24:07** in the end, I'm being able to look at that video now with a little bit of distance.

**00:24:13** I'm happy with the way it came out. I feel like it does do a really good job of explaining like,

**00:24:18** here's what happened and here's, here's what we're thinking about. It made that more obviously the

**00:24:23** right decision in the framework of like, what is the clearest possible thing to do in, in this

**00:24:29** situation. But again, you know, you can argue that without the theme, you may not have been

**00:24:34** able to approach that so well, because this is one of those things where, you know, like having an

**00:24:40** error in a video, which is obviously it's a thing, it's an important thing for you. It's a thing you

**00:24:44** want to never happen because it's, you know, it goes against what, what you're trying to produce,

**00:24:50** right? You don't want errors because I'm your friend. I poke fun at you a little bit of it

**00:24:54** because it feels like to me on the outside, the error that you made is not that bad. But I know,

**00:25:01** I understand that it doesn't matter how big or small the error is. An error that changes part of

**00:25:09** what you were saying is something you never want to occur, right? Like it's otherwise you wouldn't

**00:25:13** bother putting so much time into the research. It's like, why put so much time into the research?

**00:25:17** If you if you're okay with having errors, you know, you may as well just rush these things out there.

**00:25:22** But there's an interesting thing where with things like this, things that seem so large

**00:25:27** to people who are independently creative, is inside of a large company, there's like a process.

**00:25:34** Someone can tell you what to do. Like, oh, you made the error. Oh, we'll go talk to Mandy.

**00:25:41** Mandy's got it all sorted out. She can give you the, the two step plan to fix this problem. Or like,

**00:25:48** ultimately, there was an error and someone's going to be mad at you. But like, whatever,

**00:25:52** it's not going to affect the corporate wheel that much. These are these types of situations that

**00:25:58** occur where it's like, you have to work out how to handle this yourself. And no one can help you,

**00:26:06** you have to do it. And, and being in that mindset, the clarity mindset, must have been very good for

**00:26:14** you to deal with something that is really important to you. And is kind of the first

**00:26:18** time there's something that has happened. You do tease me about it. And every time you breathe it

**00:26:22** up, I always feel this this immediate reason of like, but Mike, let me explain to you why this

**00:26:27** is a perfect storm, right? It's not just that it's an error. Like, here's the five reasons why like

**00:26:32** this error is a catastrophic error, right? Which again, is the whole point of the video that exists.

**00:26:36** Again, for the people who listen to us talk and are interested in the self employment part of that,

**00:26:44** this is also the thing that is the biggest burden and the hardest part about being self employed.

**00:26:51** And the thing that you just, you just can't internalize as an employee until you're out

**00:27:00** all on your own. And it's like, Oh, it is entirely on my shoulders. And even if I'm working with other

**00:27:06** people, like it's still ultimately like, this is where this is where all the responsibility lies.

**00:27:12** And yeah, I mean, it's funny that you mentioned about like, Oh, the mistake stuff, because it

**00:27:18** does immediately cast my mind back to, you know, when I worked as a teacher and I would make a

**00:27:22** mistake or something would go wrong. And yeah, you're right. There's some process or whatever,

**00:27:26** or someone is unhappy with you. And then you leave the meeting and it's like,

**00:27:31** okay, but nothing happens, right? Someone was just annoyed at me for 10 minutes and life goes on.

**00:27:38** But when you're doing something on your own, it's like, you just, you have no idea the

**00:27:42** variants of all possible outcomes is enormous. And so yeah, it did, it did really help with that.

**00:27:51** And, you know, and also just in some of the post-mortem stuff, like it's definitely helped in

**00:27:55** some of the fixing the workflow and adjusting the way things work and going like, okay,

**00:28:01** how can we make sure to minimize the possibility of this kind of thing happening again?

**00:28:06** I wouldn't want the T-Coy incident to happen in a different year, because it also, again,

**00:28:11** like just the sort of luck of it is I was able to just, well, this is the next two weeks of my life.

**00:28:17** It was 100% is going to be just spent on this and like, go, go, go.

**00:28:21** You didn't have any events.

**00:28:22** Yeah.

**00:28:23** You weren't somewhere you didn't want to be.

**00:28:25** Yeah. There was no conference. I mean, this is also why, you know, this sounds like a fantasy

**00:28:31** land from a previous life. I have YouTube friends who I know they will just schedule

**00:28:38** videos to upload at the time that they want to. And if they're going to be on a plane or whatever,

**00:28:43** like that's what happens. And I always feel like, how can you do that?

**00:28:49** Our CMS has a scheduling system, right? And I can publish episodes whenever I want to based on that.

**00:28:56** I never use it.

**00:28:57** Yeah.

**00:28:58** I never will publish something unless I am ready to publish it and I'm able to sit

**00:29:03** and just make sure it's all good.

**00:29:06** Yeah. I totally get it. Yeah. And this is reinforced that of like,

**00:29:14** don't upload a video right before you're going into a conference. Like,

**00:29:20** you know, but again, that's from a fantasy world that doesn't currently exist anymore.

**00:29:25** But still, again, it's why things lined up. Like there wasn't any other distractions.

**00:29:29** It's also a side effect of, we can get to this later. I probably did it too many times this year,

**00:29:34** but it is also like, why is it that this year there's not only more videos,

**00:29:40** but there were more timely videos than in other years. And it's, again, the same thing of like,

**00:29:46** there's a lot of space this year. There's very few interruptions. If I wanted to make the call of,

**00:29:52** I'm going to spend seven days on the Supreme court. I could just make that call and go like,

**00:29:58** there just weren't other interruptions. And so the shape of many projects, at least at their start,

**00:30:05** which we'll get into later, was very clear this year.

**00:30:09** Okay. It's going to be interesting to see what you are realistically able to bring from 2020 forward.

**00:30:16** I think that's going to be an interesting thing over the next couple of years.

**00:30:20** How are you actually able to, if at all realistically bring the year of clarity

**00:30:26** into other more normal times? Yeah. Yeah.

**00:30:30** We're not going to know this. I'm just intrigued to see if or how this one can realistically be

**00:30:36** carried over. Yeah, I agree. The one thing I will say is, as we discussed, like ideally,

**00:30:42** one of the things that happens with themes or for the ones that particularly are resonant with you

**00:30:46** is they just become part of the way that you think about things. And with year of clarity,

**00:30:54** its time has come and its time I think is ebbing in some way. But without a doubt,

**00:31:02** I feel like I just have a much stronger sense of, I don't even know quite how to put it, but like,

**00:31:09** decisions should not only be logically correct, they should also just intuitively make sense

**00:31:18** and be clear. I feel like I've become much more attuned to hesitation over decisions

**00:31:27** and recognizing there's something here that I haven't clarified. And yes, this decision is

**00:31:35** logically correct. You've got it all on the piece of paper, but I'm like more sensitive

**00:31:41** to like slight hesitation somewhere in the system and being like, what is that? Like,

**00:31:47** let's figure out what this, there's some part of this that like I haven't fully unraveled. And I

**00:31:53** think that's one way in which year of clarity is going to carry with me is it's hard to articulate,

**00:31:59** but yeah, I feel more sensitized to the decision making process in a way that I,

**00:32:08** not that I wasn't before, but I'm just much more aware of. So I mean, that's what I would say, but

**00:32:15** yeah, you're overall right that this is hopefully not a reproducible year. And so it may have

**00:32:24** fewer applications to the near future. But maybe that's not important though,

**00:32:29** right? Because maybe the work that you've done in 2020 is laid a foundation, you know, stabilizing

**00:32:35** the business in certain ways, which you were already going to do irrespective of 2020 and how

**00:32:41** it went, uh, pro, pro pay dividends in the long run. So you might not need to be in isolation

**00:32:48** for nine months to still have benefit from the work that you've done this year. This episode of

**00:34:48** next move, make your next website. So I abandoned my original 2020 yearly theme in July to respond

**00:34:56** to how my life drastically changed during the pandemic. I think pretty much any other year

**00:35:03** I would have been able to carry on my theme. But the problem was my original theme, the year of

**00:35:09** refinement in 2020 was mostly focused on taking my foot off the gas, right? Which was just from a

**00:35:18** work perspective, just not a thing that I was able to do in 2020. So in episode 104 of Cortex,

**00:35:26** I provided the review of my original yearly theme and then set my new yearly theme. So if you want

**00:35:33** to hear my review of the year of refinement to that point, you can go and check out that episode. And

**00:35:40** it's there for you to listen to. Yeah. I mean, we can still pour one out for the year of refinements.

**00:35:46** Yeah, we don't know what we're pouring out though, because we never got to learn about the wine.

**00:35:49** Oh, God. And yes, I have been bumping on a introduction to wine tasting course that Stephen

**00:35:58** bought me for my birthday. I've been pumping that down the line for the last year. Like,

**00:36:04** why don't we do it in two months time? Why don't we do it in two months time? I had to pay 15 pounds

**00:36:10** to extend it past the year. Because it was like a voucher, right? Right. And they were like, look,

**00:36:16** we usually don't extend them, but obviously, you know, what are we going to do? Could you pay us a

**00:36:23** little as I find, right? I'll give you 15 quid and then we'll do it sometime in 2021.

**00:36:27** Yeah. Yeah. It was heartbreaking and bizarre to hear you talk about year of refinements on the

**00:36:35** 2020 show. Just again, it's like, I don't know, it was like listening to a little flower describe

**00:36:44** the glorious future that it's going to have. As you can see a steamroller slowly moving toward

**00:36:49** it in the distance. I couldn't listen to it. I think that's fair. So I listened back to

**00:36:54** the episode like you did. And when I got to that point, I stopped. Yeah. I think that was good

**00:36:58** decision. I couldn't do it. Basically. So I set up the year shift instead. So, you know, I realized

**00:37:06** that I was in a position where I had to adapt and I had to change a bunch of stuff in my work

**00:37:13** and the challenges of a world changing event put a lot of stress into my work life. And it was,

**00:37:18** you know, this is not a thing that I would normally do, but it was just these things don't

**00:37:23** come along very often. And I had to adapt. I needed a new theme. I couldn't just pause my theme or say,

**00:37:29** Oh, like, I'll just take some elements of it. I had to go back to the beginning again and set a new

**00:37:34** one. And so I break my theme down into like a bunch of little things that I would like to focus

**00:37:39** on. None of them goals so much, but just how the themes come to be. So the year shift had a bunch

**00:37:46** of sections and one was to shift the business model of Relay FM to focus on our new membership

**00:37:53** program. And this has gone so well. It was an incredible amount of time and effort over basically

**00:38:02** a six month period. I mean, I think I've said it on this show already, but I was just saying again,

**00:38:07** because it's worthwhile for the recap is both me and my co-founder Steven have said that we have

**00:38:13** not worked so hard since we launched the company. Yeah, over a crunch period of time. And it was

**00:38:19** needed because being able to get the membership in place and revamp it to what it was and give

**00:38:26** all the benefits including like the membership bonus shows with the bonus content and having

**00:38:32** our Discord and all that stuff. It took a lot from technical messaging and content,

**00:38:39** but it provided us with like a new baseline that we could build from and financially provided me

**00:38:46** a bit more security in time of uncertainty, which honestly continues, right? Like advertising

**00:38:52** continues to be uncertain. And so having not just a new baseline from the support from our members,

**00:39:03** but also a kind of pressure release valve of if things got really bad again, we have something

**00:39:13** that we can lean on and being able to have that in place provides much more relief for us.

**00:39:23** I mean, yeah, I think the people who are not in or adjacent to the industry may not be aware,

**00:39:32** but yeah, the whole world of advertising and all of the content that it provides is just,

**00:39:41** it's been a hell of a variant year for that. And so yeah, that's why like you did so much work to

**00:39:49** get that membership up and running to be like this foundation upon which Relay can stand.

**00:39:56** Like I still can't believe how quickly you were able to get it to roll out at all. It was just,

**00:40:05** I can't imagine the time that you put in to make it happen.

**00:40:09** Yeah, it was a big event for us to do it. And what was really important to me,

**00:40:16** which I feel like we've delivered from is that there was a value exchange.

**00:40:22** Like we already had a system that provided content once a year, like in our kind of our

**00:40:29** TechSaventure specials and that kind of stuff. And we could have lent on that and said like,

**00:40:34** look, this is a difficult time. We're unsure what the future holds and we'd appreciate your support.

**00:40:41** We could have done that, but I wanted to be able to provide more value in exchange for it.

**00:40:50** And I feel like we've succeeded on that, you know, so the shows that I'm really working hard on

**00:40:57** for the membership, the shows that have defined membership stuff that I'm working on,

**00:41:01** we produce more content, which takes more work. But that's what I was comfortable with, you know,

**00:41:08** just we have done, you know, the easy thing to do, the thing people always ask us to do is

**00:41:12** just remove the ads and give us an ad free feed. And that's fine. But I still, I, it felt better.

**00:41:19** It felt more right to me to then also have more content. Like that's what has always felt right

**00:41:27** to me is that it's the balance of those things. Like you don't have to hear the ads anymore

**00:41:32** because you're giving us money. And what I can give you is content. That's what, that's what I

**00:41:36** quote unquote sell always. Right. And it took a lot and it continues to take a lot, but I'm very

**00:41:43** happy with it. And like similarly, so another thing that I wanted to do was to shift my focus more to

**00:41:49** content over business. So like thinking about like the thing that I love to do and the thing

**00:41:55** that I think I'm best at is helping produce the content, not necessarily like just running a

**00:42:01** business. Right. And I wanted to see how I could start to spread that out more over the last half

**00:42:07** of the year. And what I'll say is I've definitely spent more time in 2020 focusing on making content

**00:42:13** the best it can be. And I want to continue doing that, but I haven't handed anything off.

**00:42:19** Okay. Right. Yeah. I was wondering about that part of it and how you felt like that's gone.

**00:42:27** It's too soon. Okay. For me. Because the thing that I hadn't

**00:42:34** accounted for is that I wouldn't be able to let anything go very easily.

**00:42:41** Okay. And I think that that time is still to come, but we need more stability again.

**00:42:48** And that's going to be in the future. So your assessment is like, this is not a good time to

**00:42:53** be cutting projects. No. Okay. No. I think that makes sense. So like, you know, really the things

**00:43:00** that are occurring and the things that were already happening, you know, so like one of the

**00:43:04** things I wanted to do and to continue to do. And the thing that is happening is that I deal less

**00:43:12** with advertising sales. And that has been a thing that's been moving along forever as we have a

**00:43:18** sales manager. She's better than me. And she handles most of the new business now. And I was

**00:43:23** looking at kind of applying that thinking into other parts of the business. And I didn't really

**00:43:28** have a good goal. And it just like, I wanted to move along that path. That has not happened at all.

**00:43:34** And all I've really done is add more in, which, you know, I'm spending more time on

**00:43:40** purchasing the content than I ever have. And I haven't decreased anything. So I think that there

**00:43:46** is still a desire to rebalance this, but I don't know when that's going to be. I don't have

**00:43:55** a plan for that. And I'm fine with that for now.

**00:43:58** Yeah. I think this is also just another example of circumstances change. And yeah, if you're

**00:44:07** creating a new value proposition for people to pay money for content, this is the time where it's

**00:44:14** like, yeah, you're going to be spending more time creating that. And yeah, again, it's why I like

**00:44:21** that. I think your shift to the shift theme was great. And I'm glad that you recognized that it

**00:44:27** was a thing that you needed to do because it, yeah, like it couldn't be more at odds with what

**00:44:33** needed to happen than the previous theme. And I feel like this is a good example of it. Like

**00:44:39** you know, like you said, you haven't worked as hard since the founding of the company. And

**00:44:45** that makes sense for this year. And that's how things are sometimes. I do like, as your co-host

**00:44:53** and as your friend, I do hope that you are able to relinquish some more responsibilities at some

**00:45:02** point in the not too distant future. But yeah, I think it would be very ill-advised to have done

**00:45:08** that this year. I think I've learned something about myself this year. I think that the pandemic

**00:45:17** has, and like the way that I've worked through it has really shone a light on part of my personality,

**00:45:25** which is that I can't let go. And that's something I know I need to work on.

**00:45:33** So I tell you one way this is manifested. I have not taken a day's vacation since January.

**00:45:42** Okay. Yeah. That's too many days. Even for a busy year, that's too many work days in a row.

**00:45:49** I have not taken a day off where I should have been working, you know, like,

**00:45:53** which is what I would do in the past. It's like, you know, I'll go on vacation, so I'll move stuff

**00:45:56** around for a week or I'm traveling. So we'll need, I'll need to like have someone else fill in for

**00:46:02** me or I'll skip an episode or something. I've not done any of that. And this year I have also not

**00:46:08** been very good at observing weekends at all. And the reason this has happened is because I have not

**00:46:17** done it. Right? Like I have decided no, I cannot. And that is how I felt. I cannot.

**00:46:25** I cannot take a day off. Right? And that is not good. And I know it's not good,

**00:46:30** but there's nothing I can do about it right now. And unfortunately, there were two times this year

**00:46:36** where I've tried to take a vacation and work has pulled me back in again. So we are now at the end

**00:46:42** of the year and I haven't done it. Luckily, Christmas is going to give me that time. Good.

**00:46:49** I will be taking a week off over Christmas, which is something that we always have done.

**00:46:53** And it was just a case of like, we plan to take the Christmas week off every year. So all the

**00:46:59** shows were already blocked off in the Canada. Everyone else is expecting they wouldn't be

**00:47:03** working. So maybe I'll just do five monologues for a week, but you know, maybe I'll just take that

**00:47:08** week off. Right. I think the only day off that I've had thinking about it was Thanksgiving day,

**00:47:16** but I only shifted the work back to the Saturday and Sunday. Like, you know,

**00:47:21** right. And I only have Thanksgiving day off because no one was around to work.

**00:47:26** Right. Because all of your coworkers are American. Yeah, I had no choice. But yeah,

**00:47:31** look, I'm very aware of the like the unhealthy situation that I put myself in this year by doing

**00:47:36** this. Yeah. But I also just felt like there was never a point where I could have pulled myself

**00:47:46** away. Yeah. And I'm not going to argue against you there. Right. Like, you know, I'm not going to,

**00:47:52** I'm not going to put poo you about like, Oh, you should, you should take more weekends off.

**00:47:55** Yeah. This much more so than, you know, for you than for me, because of your industry, like,

**00:48:01** you had to have a real crunch here and there's just, there's just no way around that. And that

**00:48:06** happens sometimes. Well, I could have decided not to, but I wasn't willing to throw all the dice on

**00:48:11** that. Yeah. Yeah. And, and I, I think I would, I would have viewed that as, as, as a, I don't

**00:48:18** quite want to say irresponsible, but I would have felt like that would be a bad set of dice to roll.

**00:48:23** Like the trade offs here don't make, don't make sense. And so I'm just glad to hear that,

**00:48:29** you know, coming to the end of 2020, you're at least recognizing this situation and recognizing.

**00:48:34** Because I'm so tired, gray. Like I really am so tired. Like in a way that is not, I'm sleepy.

**00:48:46** It's like, I'm, I'm, I'm at the edge of burning out here. You know? Right. Like, I know it's there

**00:48:54** and you'll hear my 2021 theme. Like you'll hear in it, a man who's aware of it.

**00:49:02** Okay. Good. Because there's just been a lot of stuff for like, I'm getting to the end of my rope,

**00:49:08** as my name would say with it, like where it's just like, I've, I've reached the maximum that

**00:49:13** I can live my life this way, but I just cannot see like lots of people who are smarter than me

**00:49:25** and who know me better than I know myself will tell me that I should have taken a break this year.

**00:49:30** But I will argue against all of them because I just could not have done it. There's

**00:49:37** not just my livelihood. There's lots of people's livelihoods at stake at the over this last year.

**00:49:45** And we've gotten through it. And I, I cannot see a way in which it would have been to use the word

**00:49:53** that you said, like responsible of me to not have my hands on the wheel constantly.

**00:50:02** It's, and I know that there are people listening to this show who I'm sure who have been in the

**00:50:08** exact same boat as me, like lots of business owners, I'm sure have had a very, very different year

**00:50:14** trying to navigate this stuff, because it's like, you know, like more bad stuff happened in a four

**00:50:23** month period than like three years worth of bad stuff. Like it was just, you know,

**00:50:31** March to May was a bloodbath. It was just horrible. And going through that, knowing that

**00:50:39** at any point it could happen again, I just felt like I had no choice for my own sanity.

**00:50:48** To not be on switched on constantly. And look, I know I'm starting to pay the price for it a little

**00:50:59** bit now. But I am happy to take that then to have been in a situation where

**00:51:10** things could have gotten really bad. And they didn't.

**00:51:14** Yeah. And again, like I agree with you, like, you know, knowing some of what you knew about the

**00:51:19** industry at that point in time, like you were right to make this call.

**00:51:24** And also know it's not a way to live my life. And I'm sure I'll be able to look back at this time and

**00:51:30** be like, so that was when I started to change my life again. And I see this as a point to enable

**00:51:40** me to do that. But I had to get through it. Anyway, so other things that I wanted to shift,

**00:51:47** I wanted to shift my own approach to finances a little bit, just personal stuff, thinking about

**00:51:52** like, what savings are what my retirement is, like all those boring things. Right. But when you are

**00:52:00** put in a situation where you're like, Oh boy, am I going to lose it all? You kind of like,

**00:52:08** you kind of like try and be a little bit more responsible.

**00:52:11** Yeah. When the finance tree gets shook by the, by the winds of global change,

**00:52:17** you start looking around and thinking, Hmm, prepare the way for this. Yeah. Just a thing to think about.

**00:52:25** And also I wanted to shift my mental energy to get back to learning some new things.

**00:52:31** So when I had downtime, when I had space, what was I doing? And this came from the sense of like,

**00:52:39** everything outside is so horrible. Stop looking at that when you have any spare time

**00:52:47** try and look at new things, find new things to occupy yourself. So more text listeners

**00:52:55** and subscribers will know that I had a brief flirtation with trying to learn programming.

**00:53:00** I was wondering if you were going to mention that here.

**00:53:02** Did not go well. That was a very, that was an arc for a few months. That went away because I found

**00:53:09** other things that I like more. Yeah. Yeah. I think, I think the, the programming 2020 was not

**00:53:17** fertile ground for that project. Yep. But, but also I think, yeah, you, you immediately found

**00:53:24** other things that you like more. Yeah. And it, it made, it made sense to shift your attention

**00:53:28** very quickly to those things. So like this is one thing that has kind of been out from my whole

**00:53:33** year is I've found a spot that I enjoy, which is Formula One. I cannot believe this. Okay. Okay.

**00:53:38** So when I was listening to our old episode, you know, and just like hearing what we're talking

**00:53:43** about. And when you mentioned you were starting to get into F1 last year, that was one of those

**00:53:49** things that I mentally chalked up as a 100%. There's no way Mike is still following F1 now.

**00:53:57** No way. That's going to be the case. I absolutely love it. I love it. That's, I can't believe that

**00:54:02** if I had to bet money on one thing, I would have bet that the F1 was no longer around. I can't

**00:54:08** believe it. Oh man. It's so good. It's so good. It's something that me and Adina really enjoy

**00:54:14** together. That's amazing. And we're just really into it. Like we love the races. We love following

**00:54:20** the drama between the races. Do you have a team that you follow? Who's your home car team?

**00:54:28** Because it's been like my first year. I'm still kind of, I moved around a lot and I'm more focused

**00:54:35** on particular drivers than teams. Okay. People will hate this, but I really love Lewis Hamilton.

**00:54:43** And the reason people will hate that is because he's the best, but I can't help, but I really

**00:54:53** appreciate him as a competitor and also as a role model. He's really kind of come into his

**00:54:59** own this year in a lot of really great ways. Plus it's quite incredible to have started watching

**00:55:05** this sport at the year where he has started to break all the records for being the greatest of all

**00:55:10** time. Oh, okay. Good timing then. It's quite a time to come into a sport when you can watch someone

**00:55:16** who is the best at the top of their game. Right. So that's been a very fun thing for me. And it's

**00:55:22** one of the reasons that I really enjoy watching him. And there's a few other people, like a guy

**00:55:27** called George Russell, who I really like. And there's a lot, basically we've come into a year

**00:55:33** where there's just a lot going on. I really, really recommend the Netflix documentary Drive to Survive.

**00:55:40** It's like, this is why we got into it. My friend Austin recommended that we watch this documentary

**00:55:46** because he loves F1. And that's also been cool because we've been sharing it together too. And

**00:55:51** we spend a lot of time talking about it together as well. So yeah, it's just been a really nice

**00:55:55** thing for me this year, like a nice new thing to get into. So I really love that. But my biggest,

**00:56:01** biggest new hobby this year is keyboards. Into them keyboards.

**00:56:08** You become a keyboard maniac. The custom mechanical keyboard world is a world that I

**00:56:12** have dove into big time, but we're not going to talk about it yet. We're going to talk about it

**00:56:16** later in the episode. Okay. The last thing in my year of shift was to quote shift product creation

**00:56:24** for Cortex brand that had a very specific meaning that I didn't really get into. It has taken a ton

**00:56:33** of work and I guess we can talk about what that means now, right? Yes. Theme system journal.

**00:56:41** Second edition. I have been working on this since April.

**00:56:46** Actively. Yes. Every day. It has been something in the works for months before then. I think

**00:56:54** probably in kind of January, we put the work in in creating the new artwork that will go in the

**00:57:04** journal, if you would call it that. So like the actual, what it would look like, but then the

**00:57:10** production, the creation of the product has been a daily task since April to now. You can go to

**00:57:17** cortex, march.com right now and buy your own second edition theme system journal.

**00:57:24** It's finally here. It is finally here. Oh my God. It's finally here.

**00:57:31** So I want to dive into what we've done with this. So one of the things that hasn't changed is the

**00:57:40** system that underpins the journal. So the journal itself is still broken down into three main

**00:57:48** sections. You have your yearly theme pages where you outline the theme that you've chosen,

**00:57:52** which I'm sure you will have chosen either by now, or maybe just after listening to this episode,

**00:57:57** once you've got that inspiration from our themes, you then have your journal pages,

**00:58:02** which is where you spend time reflecting on your day. So you write down like how you're thinking,

**00:58:07** how you're feeling, and then your daily themes pages, which is where you keep track of some

**00:58:12** prompts that keep you on course with your theme. There is more to the system than this. If you're

**00:58:18** new to the theme system, go to the theme system.com where we outline in more detail what each of

**00:58:26** those sections are and how you can use them to help create a real kind of daily reflection of

**00:58:32** your yearly theme. And this has been something that I mean, I've been using every day now for

**00:58:39** multiple years at this point, because I'd created the system before there was a journal, right?

**00:58:47** And this idea of having this book, which I come to every day, where I write down kind of what the

**00:58:53** good things in my day were, what the bad things in my day were, what I'm thinking about, what's on

**00:58:57** my mind, and then go and kind of like check off, like have I made progress in these eight things

**00:59:04** this this day has been a very useful thing. And I would say for me this year, once I changed my

**00:59:12** theme to the year of shift and going in every day and being like, am I moving the needle on

**00:59:18** these things that are important is continue to be like a really, really great thing for me this year.

**00:59:23** So I really encourage people to go and check this out. If you have a theme or if you have a theme

**00:59:29** that you're working on, the journal is a great way to make it a part of your every day.

**00:59:34** Yeah. You want to externalize your thoughts in some manner and having this structure to help

**00:59:44** keep bringing you back to the theme is incredibly helpful. I've always said like journaling is just

**00:59:50** so, it's so effective. It's shocking how well this can work to just revisit in an external way.

**01:00:00** That's not just in your head, thoughts that you want to revisit. And if you've never tried it,

**01:00:06** if you, I just incredibly strongly recommend that you give it a shot, like get a theme journal.

**01:00:16** You know, it's a new dawn at 2021. And I think this, this can be an incredibly helpful way

**01:00:24** to direct this ship of your life going forward.

**01:00:31** Now, for people that have tried the journal out before, or for people that are interested

**01:00:34** in what is different, I want to talk about some of the things that we've done. So we've made some

**01:00:39** slight modifications to the print and lunder pages to basically make these areas of the book the best

**01:00:46** that they can possibly be. So for the journal pages, we've added an additional data box at

**01:00:52** the top of the page. This is where I write down what pens I'm using every day. But it's just like

**01:00:57** a really thin box that goes across the top. It's like one little piece of information. I thought

**01:01:01** like you could put the weather in there. You could put a song that you're listening to in there,

**01:01:05** a quote, something like that. This is like a nice little just a thin piece of information.

**01:01:10** We've also numbered the pages now. Previously, we were like working on a system of having just,

**01:01:15** you write your own numbers in if you wanted to. And I get why people wanted numbered pages rather

**01:01:20** than writing their own page numbers. We've now found a way to make that work. There's a lot of

**01:01:25** considerations you have to make about printing to allow for page numbering. It's kind of a weird

**01:01:29** thing, but I found a way to make it work. So the pages are now numbered, if that's the thing that's

**01:01:34** important to you. And on the daily theme pages, this is where you kind of track your little things

**01:01:38** for the day. We've now added more rows and more columns. So each double page spread lets you track

**01:01:45** 15 days. We have six of these. So you can track 90 days in total, which now matches with the journal

**01:01:51** pages. So each book is good for 90 tracked days. So depending on how often you're tracking or how

**01:01:57** often you're journaling can last you anywhere from like three to six months and maybe more.

**01:02:01** It took a lot of work to try and work out what the optimum number is. And I went with 15. So if you

**01:02:07** do 15 days per double page spread, you can do basically two weeks if you track every day,

**01:02:13** three weeks if you track every work day. And it's also a quarter of a season. But the biggest

**01:02:19** changes for the second edition is the fact that we went back to the literal drawing board with the

**01:02:26** book itself. It is made completely differently. The book is now made in Europe, which has made

**01:02:32** the making of the book a lot easier for me. Yeah. I mean, I've got to say, talking to you about it,

**01:02:37** you know, this has clearly made one of the biggest differences in just the feedback time

**01:02:44** for going between iterations. Yep. And also, I've had a lot of physical prototypes made,

**01:02:51** and I can have them the next day. It's magic getting a next day delivery.

**01:02:55** So the prototyping stages have been really important for me because I guess the key difference

**01:03:00** here is our first edition, we were working with our very good friends, Tom and Dan at Studio Neat,

**01:03:06** who make a selection of incredible products from accessories for your technology products to some

**01:03:12** of my favorite pens and paper out there. The system second edition, it was all me.

**01:03:20** So I made every decision. I worked with all of the suppliers. I basically felt like I was at a

**01:03:27** point where this is always what I wanted to do. I wanted to be the person who made all the decisions.

**01:03:31** And I needed the expertise and I've got to that point. So I chose every paper we're using. I chose

**01:03:40** all the production and did the whole thing. That's one of the reasons why it took from

**01:03:44** April to December because we started again. It's a huge accomplishment. And when we were talking

**01:03:52** about the, you know, the journal, you know, the idea of it years ago now, who even knows? This to

**01:04:00** me was always one of the really important things about this as a product is like, this is where

**01:04:07** I want you to express your pickiness in the physical form of the thing. Like I wanted you to be

**01:04:16** completely happy with the paper and the design and the way it feels and like all of the little

**01:04:23** intangibles that someone who is deeply familiar with the whole pen and notebook world is sensitized

**01:04:31** to. And, you know, for this second edition, like the amount of work that you've put into it is

**01:04:38** just, it's inconceivable. It's a huge amount of work that you've done on this and it's come out

**01:04:44** amazing. Yeah. I've been using some variation of the second edition since May. So like, as we've

**01:04:51** been prototyping it, I have been using the prototypes. I was, I think surprising the print

**01:04:58** company that we were working with, because this isn't, I found out this is not normal to prototype

**01:05:04** and continue to prototype so frequently. You know, it would be like, okay, I would choose a paper,

**01:05:10** we'd have a prototype made. And I was like, I'm not so sure I want to try this paper. And they

**01:05:14** would send me the new paper and they'd be like, we done now? No, no, we need to prototype that paper.

**01:05:18** And I kept doing it multiple times and it was quite confusing to them. And I don't, I'm not sure

**01:05:23** why it was, but, you know, I was never happy with just, okay, so we're now going to use this paper.

**01:05:32** And then we'll just go ahead and make it. So no, I want the book in that paper.

**01:05:36** I've found so many interesting things this year, like about the way that the paper products and

**01:05:43** how paper reacts to the way in which it's printed. So the prototyping process would never give me the

**01:05:53** actual final version. So the machines that they use for prototyping are not the same machines that

**01:05:59** use for mass production, which makes sense because a lot of the cost in producing paper goods is

**01:06:06** using the machine, right? Like the, if you make a thousand, it's not double the price of 500.

**01:06:13** It's actually a marginal difference. A lot of the, something that's used in these industries is

**01:06:20** a lot of the cost is turning on the machine. Like that, that's what the cost is. And there were like,

**01:06:25** you know, so I found out a lot of the different attributes that these types of prototyping machines

**01:06:30** would do to a paper to the final product. And yeah, it was like a lot, it was like a lot, a lot,

**01:06:35** a lot of iteration and the materials in the journal are all different now. So the paper,

**01:06:41** the paper was the thing that took the longest. It was months of samples and then prototyping those

**01:06:47** samples. And I think that we've landed on something that feels more luxurious. So the paper is thicker

**01:06:54** than it was before, which was something that was really important to me, which has made the book

**01:06:59** itself thicker. It's made the book more substantial feeling. And I have lots of different pens. And

**01:07:06** this journal will stand stands up to all of them. It will take all of them. Thicker pens, thinner

**01:07:13** pens, different types of inks. I'm really happy with what I consider to be just an excellent

**01:07:19** all round paper. I'm very, very pleased with it. And this is the thing that I fretted over the most,

**01:07:26** because it was important to me. One thing I did not want to do as Mike Hurley, one half of the

**01:07:32** panadic podcast was put his name on a book that was not made of great paper. And it was, it was

**01:07:40** like, you're staking your reputation on this kid. You better do it right. And, and I'm really happy

**01:07:45** with where we've ended up with it. Yeah. I mean, again, I think the listeners can hear it, but this

**01:07:51** is a journal that is made with a lot of sweat and a lot of love. And it's also, I mean, you say it

**01:07:59** there very quickly, but I think it's just an indication of, yes, most manufacturers are not

**01:08:05** used to a client who wants to do many revisions over the course of a year. But I, you know,

**01:08:12** I have the journal in my hands, like the latest edition of it. And I think the effort that you

**01:08:17** have put in, in all of those little decisions that most manufacturers designing a journal

**01:08:25** don't spend that amount of time on, like it really comes through and it, and it shines through the

**01:08:30** the journal itself. Like it's, it is the sum of a very large number of small decisions. And it came

**01:08:38** out great. Thank you. The cover is really great. So we're using a thicker, more durable, more premium

**01:08:47** feeling cover. It retains its beautiful debossing. And also the binding process was really important

**01:08:54** for me to keep, which is basically when you open the notebook, it will lay flat at any point.

**01:09:00** This is something that's actually quite difficult to do, but I'm really pleased we were able to do

**01:09:04** it. And now the cover itself is thicker. The book more easily stays closed on its own as well,

**01:09:11** which I like. And one of the other things from using the original journal, and we got a lot of

**01:09:16** feedback from this, from the cortex and we've got it, and also from just myself in using it was

**01:09:21** trying to come up with some system of bookmarking. And we tried to add a ribbon to the old book

**01:09:27** design. And that was really complicated in ways that I never would have imagined. And so we came

**01:09:31** up with a system that I much prefer, which is every page, the corner of each page is perforated

**01:09:38** with this really large perforation that makes it very, very easy to pull off the corners of the

**01:09:43** pages. And the perforation is also rounded, but as you tear off each corner of the page,

**01:09:49** when you look at the, it's not the spine, but the opposite of the spine. When the book is closed,

**01:09:56** and you look at the page edge, as you're pulling off the pages, it almost starts to look like a

**01:10:02** progress bar through the season. Yeah. And I love this detail. So not only can you very easily find

**01:10:09** where you are as your next day in the book, but as you look at the physical book, you get to see

**01:10:15** your progress through the theme, through a year. And I think that that has come out to be one of

**01:10:20** my very favorite things about the second edition. It makes it quite novel. And I really love that a

**01:10:24** lot. Yeah. I also think it's such a great solution to a problem. That's not what you were looking

**01:10:31** for. You want a bookmark, but you come up with something better, which is the progress bar of

**01:10:39** the theme over the season. It's really lovely. So yeah, that is the second edition of the

**01:10:44** theme system journal. It is available right now. It's really real. This day is finally here.

**01:10:53** I kind of can't believe it at this point. I know. We have more of these in stock than we've ever

**01:10:58** had before, but I have no idea. I genuinely have no idea how we could either have enough stock for

**01:11:03** six months or six weeks. We never know with this. We never know. We have ordered the most we've

**01:11:09** ever ordered because this is the time of the year that people want them the most for good reason.

**01:11:13** Yes. Now is the time to go and buy one. Go to cortexmerch.com and you can pick up a theme

**01:11:18** system journal, second edition for yourself right now. They are in stock and ready to ship. So if

**01:11:23** you check it out, we really appreciate it. And I hope that if you do pick up one of these, not only

**01:11:30** will it help you with your year, I hope that you'll be able to tell how much work went into it.

**01:11:34** I want to reiterate that I'm a big believer in this idea of themes for your year. I think

**01:11:42** it is by far one of the biggest impact things you can possibly do for the least amount of effort.

**01:11:52** So if you were thinking about it at all, I really suggest you give the theme system journal the

**01:12:00** try. Do it to express your gratitude for the tremendous amount of work that Mike has put in

**01:12:05** and do it for yourself, for the, like I said, the dawn of a new year for a way to, a way to

**01:12:12** improve things. And also for the cortex listeners, just to let you know, like, yes, Mike and I have

**01:12:19** put in a very big order of journals. But I am going to promote this on my YouTube channel at some point.

**01:12:28** So I'm just saying right now, if you want a journal, now is the time to buy them to make sure

**01:12:38** that you get a journal. Because we legitimately have no idea what that's going to mean. We don't

**01:12:44** know what that's going to mean. Yeah. We don't have any idea. Like, you know, are the YouTube

**01:12:51** viewers as interested in the journal as the cortex listeners? I have no idea, but I am just

**01:12:58** saying like, if you're listening to this episode right now and you think, yeah, I want a journal,

**01:13:06** you should get a journal right now. This episode of Cortex is brought to you by FitBod. FitBod is

**01:15:05** any reps or anything like that, I can do that. So this helps keep me focused and away from

**01:15:09** distractions from my phone during workouts. If something that's in your themes this year is

**01:15:50** And Mike, every year I feel like you want me to just dive right into it.

**01:15:56** You can take whatever route you want to take.

**01:15:58** I'm perfectly fine just telling you this year.

**01:16:01** Oh, okay.

**01:16:02** This year is year of the voyage.

**01:16:07** Oh man, that's good. See, I hate it because I really struggled with my name this year.

**01:16:13** And you have such a good one.

**01:16:15** The names are hard. The names are totally hard.

**01:16:17** The names are hard. Sometimes they're easy. Most of the time they're hard.

**01:16:22** Like sometimes the name just like, boom, right? Like year of shift, I was super happy with that.

**01:16:27** And it came to me really easily. This year's name was a little trickier.

**01:16:31** Yeah. Well, I don't know if you even want to talk about it now, but we've, because obviously we know

**01:16:36** we're going to be talking about the themes at the end of the year. We never discuss what our themes

**01:16:41** actually are, but we have sometimes had conversations sort of about the ideas of the themes.

**01:16:50** I knew that you were having some trouble coming up with a theme for this year, which I think,

**01:16:57** again, is no surprise and is also why, like, you know, when we talked about it, I wasn't worried

**01:17:04** either because, you know, I had only just settled on my idea of a theme, which again,

**01:17:10** is months later than it normally happens. So I think it's just a, it's a difficult year for

**01:17:16** things to come together and to think about. And also then having, for us being in the position

**01:17:24** of having a name that also has to not just mean something for us, but can communicate something

**01:17:30** to the listener also adds like a difficult challenge in what is the yearly theme going to be.

**01:17:36** Yeah, exactly. What I will say about that now is I really struggled until it was crystallized.

**01:17:44** Oh, okay. Good. Good.

**01:17:45** Right. There was a point in the last couple of weeks working on this where I was like,

**01:17:49** I got it now. So the Year of the Voyage is different in several ways. One of the things

**01:17:58** about this theme for me is, you know, as we discussed, I think it is important that themes,

**01:18:07** it's not that they can't have a fail state, but you should try to design them so that they don't

**01:18:12** have a fail state. You know, thinking about how this year was very unexpected, you know,

**01:18:18** we're also in a situation where, again, the variance of what next year could be is quite

**01:18:25** high. It's hard to know like, what is the next year going to look like? And so for me, I very

**01:18:31** much wanted to have a theme that was a coin with two sides. And so the first part of that is when

**01:18:41** you were talking about how will clarity continue to be part of your life going into the future.

**01:18:46** It's interesting because yes, that is a thing that will happen. But what I really want to establish

**01:18:54** as the thing going forward in my life indefinitely is this idea of spaceship you. Like I think

**01:19:06** for me this year, like anyone who has listened to us talk on Cortex for years knows, like I've been

**01:19:13** talking about a lot of the ideas in spaceship you for a long time. None of it is like, oh,

**01:19:19** I just came up with all of this stuff this year, but the pandemic forced me into a

**01:19:26** consolidation of a bunch of what I knew were the most important ideas in working life for me,

**01:19:33** and also gave them just an incredibly solid mental framework. And so the first side of the coin

**01:19:42** is no matter what happens in the rest of the year, no matter what it looks like,

**01:19:49** you should be able to really double down on your life is spaceship you now, that you're going to

**01:20:02** maintain this incredibly strict separation in the physical environments and really

**01:20:11** make this part of your life. Another reason for having this be year of the voyage and thinking

**01:20:17** like this is a year's goal that no matter what happens, you're going to keep up with this concept

**01:20:27** is because I think like, of course, even for me, like 2020, it wasn't all sunshine and roses.

**01:20:33** Like there was one part in the year where I was feeling really down and we'd sort of discussed

**01:20:38** it a little bit on the show. And part of what had happened at that point in time was like,

**01:20:44** I just recognized that I had lost track of reassessment points. You know, what started

**01:20:50** in the year as like, okay, we'll lock down for two weeks and then we'll reassess in a month.

**01:20:57** And then we'll reassess on July 4th that after one of those, there was no reassessment points.

**01:21:04** And that rapidly just felt terrible. Like, oh, I guess we're just going to stay inside

**01:21:13** indefinitely. There's nothing to count on the calendar. Like it happened very subtly

**01:21:18** without really noticing. And it was also very helpful with year of clarity because it,

**01:21:23** once I recognized what was going on, I was able to kind of like think through the situation and

**01:21:27** realize what the problem is. And so one of the things that I want to do with year of the voyage

**01:21:32** is actually set like this reassessment point one year in the future. And have it be for me a little

**01:21:41** bit like how you often describe the themes as a North star. Like this is a guiding point.

**01:21:50** There will always be like a reassessment point, no matter what happens, that is next year when

**01:21:58** we discuss our themes, that one of the big things will be the continuation and the deepening

**01:22:05** integration of Spaceship U into my life. What will you be reassessing? Well, so what I mean by a

**01:22:13** reassessment point is just in the same way that lockdown has been extended a bunch of times. I

**01:22:20** want to be able to know we are having another year of Spaceship U no matter what happens in

**01:22:29** the external world, because that concept is not intrinsically linked to lockdown. That concept is

**01:22:36** much more about how do I work? And in this year, even, I mean, just some of the dumb stuff that

**01:22:45** we've talked about over the course of the year, like, Oh, I painted my office deep blue, right?

**01:22:51** To visually separate the space. That stuff has also really contributed to doing more

**01:22:58** core work in this space. Like that has totally helped. And I feel like I've gotten much more

**01:23:05** into the projects when I'm working here. And so this is like the thing that I want to keep going.

**01:23:14** And just keeping this going is a good theme for the year. Like in the world of all possible

**01:23:24** variances, this is an important thing for me, because maybe 2021 looks a lot like 2020. We

**01:23:34** don't know. Maybe it doesn't, but I'm pre-deciding now that in both of those scenarios,

**01:23:41** embodying Spaceship U is a good idea. And so when I say year of the voyage,

**01:23:49** there is a way in which that means like, this is an internal voyage into the way that I maintain

**01:23:58** and think about and use the physical spaces around me to facilitate and encourage the activities that

**01:24:08** I want to do exercise, work, health, all the rest of it. So this is like setting the North Star.

**01:24:16** And I guess at a certain point, whether this year or the next year,

**01:24:21** part of it will be how do you take the like expedition craft out into the world, right?

**01:24:28** Like how do you move the spaceship with you if you're going somewhere else, right?

**01:24:34** Okay. Yes, exactly. Now we get to the other side of the coin, which is year of the voyage.

**01:24:42** One year of lockdown was refreshing. Two, it's probably too much.

**01:24:52** Right? And so too much of a good lockdown.

**01:24:56** Yeah, it's too much of a good lockdown. I like that.

**01:24:59** And, you know, one of the things that was just growing on my mind as we came to the end of the

**01:25:08** year and thinking about like, you know, what are the themes? What's next year going to look like?

**01:25:12** I realized that long-term I am not going to go two years without seeing my family in person.

**01:25:25** Like I don't care what the state of the pandemic is. That is not going to happen. This is partly

**01:25:32** what I mean by like year of the voyage in some ways is the opposite of the fuzzy was the year

**01:25:38** of clarity. Like I am kind of setting myself up with a little bit of a fail state, but also

**01:25:45** this is one of these things of like, if I've ever been determined about anything,

**01:25:50** this is one of these things that I'm determined about. Like I refuse to go two years without

**01:25:57** seeing my family in person. And there is almost no price to pay that it like, that I wouldn't pay.

**01:26:05** Like, do I have to be in America, do the lockdown thing for two weeks and like risk getting Corona

**01:26:12** at the airport, right? Like all of this stuff, it's at some point the scales go on the other side.

**01:26:18** At time of recording, we're in a very interesting position with regards to all of that, because

**01:26:24** you can be like cautiously in large caps, optimistic, lowercase, italic subscript about

**01:26:38** next year with some of the things about the vaccine rolling out. And so it does actually throw

**01:26:45** some interesting complications into how do I think about the risk and reward of endeavoring

**01:26:51** on a trip to the United States at some point next year, if it is going to happen,

**01:26:57** it does change some of the mental calculus of like, when should that happen? And all of the

**01:27:02** rest of that, but it doesn't change the fundamental decision of like, it's going to happen one way or

**01:27:09** another. Yeah. Cause I guess when you say complication, it's like, if there was no vaccine,

**01:27:14** then it's like, well, there's no good or bad time to go. It's always bad. I'll just go.

**01:27:20** So this is the funny thing. Like I decided on year of the voyage, basically two weeks before

**01:27:26** all of the positive news about the vaccine started coming out. And that doesn't change my calculation,

**01:27:32** but it does like at time of recording, it does mentally for me, push back. When does this mean

**01:27:41** like, okay, right now the correct risk reward decision is to wait until there is more information

**01:27:49** about the vaccine and how fast it's rolling out and like blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

**01:27:54** That may mean pushing back the trip to later in the year does make sense. Whereas yes,

**01:28:01** when there's no vaccine is like, I could go in January, right? Because there's, there's no

**01:28:06** upside in waiting at all. There's just downside in that it takes longer. So that that's like

**01:28:12** the opposite side of the coin is a very specific thing that in most years would saying like,

**01:28:21** Oh, my theme is year of the voyage. And one of the things that's going to happen is I'm going

**01:28:25** to America. I'm going to discover the foreign land. Yeah. Like it would feel like such a tiny

**01:28:30** and inconsequential thing to have part of it as a theme. But I actually expect like,

**01:28:35** when this happens, it will probably be a big deal. It'll be the kind of thing where

**01:28:41** I have to make a lot of plans about, okay, burning maybe two weeks before and two weeks

**01:28:46** after. And how does this work? And if I'm in America, like, how do I coordinate everything

**01:28:51** that's going to happen? Like when the trip happens, it's going to be a logistic deal,

**01:28:57** no matter what the situation is. So that is the long term and the big term is like,

**01:29:03** I will see my family in 2021. Yeah. There is a smaller part of that, which is the shorter term.

**01:29:11** Right. So we have long term, big term, short term.

**01:29:15** Do we have tiny term? No, no, no. Like, okay. It's very simple. It's a coin. There's two sides

**01:29:21** of the coin. There's three things. No, no, but the other side of the coin has two parts,

**01:29:28** right? The long term and the short term. When you say like big term, it's like if the

**01:29:32** coin lands on its edge. By the way, I haven't told you yet that there's a sub theme, but we can get

**01:29:36** to that later. Nice. I'm taking a page out of your book with the sub theme. But so for year of the

**01:29:43** voyage, the other part of that is also, I have to get out of the house more. Again, like I've

**01:29:50** loved lockdown more than any man on the face of the earth, probably. But again, it's not a situation

**01:29:56** that I can have continue indefinitely. Like it just can't. And one of the things that I

**01:30:04** have for this theme is exploring the things that are safely within my radius. You know,

**01:30:14** last year I was thinking like, Oh, I'm going to explore the world and I'm going to see all of

**01:30:18** these things and I can make videos on the interesting places that I visit. And this year

**01:30:24** I'm kind of revisiting that, but on a much smaller scale. So I definitely do want to get out of the

**01:30:31** house more. And I know myself, I need an excuse to do that. Like I need a reason to do it. Yes.

**01:30:42** I can't just tell myself like, I'm going to get out of the house more because I won't. Like I

**01:30:47** won't do it. I've lived with me long enough to know that he needs two reasons to do a thing.

**01:30:53** One reason is never enough. Yeah. That's really good.

**01:31:00** What do you think about that?

**01:31:01** That's like a really beautiful way of, of summing it up. I like that.

**01:31:05** Yeah. And so I did do like, I did do a very tiny test of this, which is I did get myself

**01:31:17** a bike, which is something I haven't owned in London in like 10 years. But part of the reason

**01:31:23** I also convinced myself to get a bike was, Oh, you can now go to places that are outside your

**01:31:33** walking travel radius, which is what you've been limited to for the previous year.

**01:31:38** And, you know, who knows? Maybe you'll film a video about those things. Maybe you'll make a

**01:31:43** video about the very fact that you got this bike. Like I needed to give myself this excuse for the

**01:31:48** reason to get it. And just having the bike and being able to extend my travel radius has been

**01:31:56** a really nice improvement for me. So here's, okay. So here's where I'm going to like call on the

**01:32:04** cortex and a little bit to help me out with this. Okay. Let me talk about the frustrations of being

**01:32:10** someone who runs a YouTube channel sometimes. Wait, what do you, what do you, you sometimes

**01:32:15** run it or sometimes have frustration? We sometimes have these frustrations. Okay. So it's specific to

**01:32:20** being a YouTube channel. So keeping this in mind, I've been thinking like, okay, I've lived in London

**01:32:25** a long time and I know some of the interesting places that exist in the city and like, Oh,

**01:32:31** I'm aware of interesting places that exist in England in a way that just when you live somewhere,

**01:32:36** you like come across these places. And so I've tried a few times in thinking about how am I

**01:32:44** going to do this to reach out to places that I think, Hey, wouldn't you love to have me come and

**01:32:53** make a video about your place? Oh, or I know this interesting thing is here. Can you just grant me

**01:32:59** access to be able to see this thing? Like when no one else is around, just, just give me access

**01:33:04** to be able to film this thing. I can talk about it. And wouldn't that be cool? You know, your

**01:33:10** little museum that's open to the public or, you know, you're just, there's a million places like

**01:33:15** this in a big city that are interesting places. And I cannot tell you how incredibly frustrating

**01:33:22** this is to actually try to do because every place that I've contacted, this is how the

**01:33:30** conversation goes. Oh man, we would love promotion. What television network are you with?

**01:33:38** And I go, I am a YouTuber. And they go, Oh, right. Well, they're like, and, and from at this point,

**01:33:47** it's, it blows my mind how frustrating the conversations are or how quickly this gets

**01:33:52** shut down. And they're like, we would love to be able to show off this thing or like, yes,

**01:33:57** please come let us know the number of crew who are going to be here. And I'm like, no, it's,

**01:34:01** it's just going to be me. It's going to be me and my phone. And then it's, it's somehow completely

**01:34:06** impossible to do. It's infuriating. It's absolutely infuriating. It's like more people than the typical

**01:34:15** television show would even command, right? Yeah. I mean, this is one of these things where this is

**01:34:21** going to sound like a brag, but it's less than a brag that it sounds like, which is yes, if I made

**01:34:26** a video about like some interesting places in the city, I know my vlogs don't get the same number of

**01:34:32** views as the animated things do, but if you are in the orbit of the entertainment world,

**01:34:39** I, I never don't find it shocking how low TV viewership numbers are. When I know someone

**01:34:49** who's involved with it, with an actual TV show and they tell me like the viewership numbers,

**01:34:55** I don't understand how that entire industry exists. It's, it's shocking. It's absolutely shocking.

**01:35:01** Well, no, great. What it, what it's just showing is how undervalued online advertising is, right?

**01:35:08** That's, that's what it is. Cause it's just advertising and it's keeping it going.

**01:35:12** But for some reason people find that allure of TV worth the money.

**01:35:16** I guess, I mean, I guess that, that must be what it is. But yeah, so like I find myself in these weird

**01:35:22** Alice in Wonderland kind of conversations of like, I can almost guarantee you I can get more people

**01:35:27** to know about the work that you do or know about this museum or whatever, but you only want to work

**01:35:33** with TV things. Like it's just, it's maddening. Like it's totally maddening. And so yeah, I found

**01:35:39** myself really thwarted on what were basically my first five or six ideas of, Oh, I would, I would

**01:35:46** make a video about this place or, Oh, I would make a video about that place. And I've contacted them

**01:35:50** and they're like, we're not interested unless you're TV. And so my call here to the Cortex

**01:35:57** audience is like, okay, listen, I know some of you live in the United Kingdom. Right. Okay. If you

**01:36:08** work at a place that you think is interesting, get in touch. This, this is all I'm saying. I feel like

**01:36:15** with every one of these places, I just need an in like I need someone who's there to vouch for

**01:36:22** who, who vouches, who can vouch for this, right? And who can be like, Oh, this guy will make an

**01:36:28** interesting video about the thing that we do here or the location that this is. And I've listened

**01:36:35** to him for years and watch his videos for years. You don't have to worry that this is like some

**01:36:41** rogue prank YouTube channel or whatever. Frankster. He's not going to come in and punk us.

**01:36:47** Yeah. He's not going to like smash your vase because it's funny. Right. But yeah, like that,

**01:36:53** that has, that has totally been my, and it's incredibly annoying. And like, I don't, I don't

**01:36:59** want to name any of these institutions in particular. Let's put them on blast.

**01:37:03** No, I'm not, I'm not going to do it, but I've just, I've just had just some crazy exchanges where it,

**01:37:15** it 100% has the feeling of like, if someone in this room just watched my channel, this would be fine.

**01:37:24** And you would let this happen. Yeah. But I think, I think there's something really weird and off

**01:37:29** putting to people of like, I'm not going to be showing up with a crew. You know what it like,

**01:37:34** my assumption as well, like I would expect for a lot of the types of places that you're trying

**01:37:38** to get in contact with and stuff. The perception of YouTubers is not good. And they heard about

**01:37:45** the person and the bad thing that they did. And that's what they must all be. So we don't trust

**01:37:52** these kids and the YouTubers. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So this is like my other side of the year of the

**01:37:58** voyage is I've got to get out of the house. I'm definitely seeing my family. That's 100%

**01:38:04** happening, but also I need to create reasons for me to get out of the house. Right. Because

**01:38:11** otherwise I know me and I won't. Okay. And so again, no matter what happens in the world,

**01:38:19** I am fairly confident that I can arrange safe transportation within the United Kingdom to an

**01:38:27** interesting location. Like that's a totally achievable thing, no matter what's going on.

**01:38:33** So what is the mechanism for these interesting places to get in contact with you then?

**01:38:40** Yeah. So I want you to use the contact form on my webpage. So it's cgpgray.com

**01:38:44** slash contact. That's where you should go. It'll be in the show notes too.

**01:38:47** Yeah. It'll be in the show notes. I feel confident for you here because we do not have the largest

**01:38:53** podcast audience in the world, but we have a big one. And our audience sometimes makes me feel like

**01:39:01** the world is smaller than it is. Because there's been many times where I've said a thing or we've

**01:39:07** said a thing or we've asked for something and somehow we end up finding someone. Yeah. And so

**01:39:15** I feel good for you in this because this is exactly the type of thing that surprises us a bunch.

**01:39:21** Yeah. Where like, oh, hang on a minute. This person does have an in in this place. And I think

**01:39:27** it does like we've spoken about it as like a selection effect and all that kind of stuff,

**01:39:32** right? Then there is probably an over indexing of the type of people that work at the type of places

**01:39:38** that you would like to visit that would also listen to this show for the same reasons that

**01:39:42** you want to go to those places. Yes, exactly. So this is also what I'm betting on here is the

**01:39:48** cortex audience is not going to be a representative sample of the general population. No.

**01:39:55** If I can say so, Mike, I think our audience on average is much more interesting than the

**01:39:59** general population. I would agree with that. I've met lots of our audience and it's like,

**01:40:03** there's no way that's not true. And so the chances of those listeners working at a place that's

**01:40:10** interesting or like knowing someone who they can recommend to be like, Hey, this guy is looking for

**01:40:15** projects, you know, get in touch. And so what I also just want to specify with this is

**01:40:20** interesting is this word that I use a lot and it's because I think it is impossible to describe

**01:40:28** characteristic of minds. Why do people find things interesting? Impossible to say. Why is F1

**01:40:36** interesting to you? Why did it stick in your mind? You can sort of give reasons and describe

**01:40:41** the sport or whatever, but like fundamentally I feel like it's, it's just a thing that exists

**01:40:48** in brains. And so when I say like I'm looking for interesting places, that is an extremely broad

**01:40:58** invitation. Some of the places I have tried to contact, I think very many people would regard

**01:41:04** as super boring, right? But it's like, I think that they're doing something interesting in this

**01:41:10** location. So what I would encourage people to say is like, don't doubt that the place is interesting.

**01:41:17** Like just, we've talked about rolling the dice on this show and this is a case of like, I want to

**01:41:24** encourage listeners to just roll the dice and get in touch and like maybe something works out.

**01:41:31** There's nothing to lose here for either of us of just like, I sometimes don't even know what will

**01:41:36** catch my own interests. So this doesn't have to be like, oh, I'm, I'm the curator of the British

**01:41:44** museum, right? Like that is not what I'm looking for. I am the aide to Royal Highness. Yeah, exactly.

**01:41:56** Like now, you know, keep in mind, I'm not going to turn those down, right? But you, if you are one

**01:42:02** of those people, you have got a leg up, but it's, you don't have to be one of those people.

**01:42:07** Yeah, yeah. And, and I think, you know, again, I feel like I can say this to the listeners here

**01:42:13** because they're going to be familiar with like the kinds of things I've made videos about. And

**01:42:18** I think one of the favorite comments I ever receive on videos is when people say something like,

**01:42:24** I never thought I would be interested in this topic, but like, I really liked this video. And

**01:42:31** I think a lot of the things that I cover at first glance can seem quite boring, but there's,

**01:42:38** there's actually something quite interesting about them. Just to give an example of the kind

**01:42:44** of thing that I'm thinking of. Mike, do you know the UK property show,

**01:42:49** Escape to the Country? Oh my God. Yes, right. I know Escape to the Country.

**01:42:57** How would you describe it for the listeners?

**01:43:01** Two retired people want to move from the city to the countryside in England.

**01:43:08** People who claim to be estate agents or were once the state agents in their life,

**01:43:13** but now present this television show, I guess just go online and find a selection of properties

**01:43:21** that they will then take the retired couple to go and look at in the hopes of finding them

**01:43:27** a new home. It is like white glove, Zoopla or whatever, right? Like it is white glove,

**01:43:32** real estate. They will then talk about it and nobody ever buys one of those houses.

**01:43:37** Well, when they do buy a house, it happens maybe one in a hundred episodes. It's the most

**01:43:40** exciting thing that ever happens. And it always happens in the post credits section as well.

**01:43:45** I happened to catch an episode recently of a show that was not Escape to the Country,

**01:43:49** but it's one of the other various spinoffs of this show where they like escape to Spain or whatever.

**01:43:54** And they actually made an offer on the show and I could not believe it.

**01:44:02** Like this has genuinely been one of my favorite shows for years. Like it's been on forever.

**01:44:09** Which is why I groaned because...

**01:44:12** Yeah, you know, I mentioned it.

**01:44:13** The Grays will bring up Escape to the Country a lot.

**01:44:17** We watch it a lot, right? We love it.

**01:44:18** I love it. It's great.

**01:44:20** Look, I know. I know you do.

**01:44:23** So the reason I bring it up now, again, is like the key characteristic that I love about the show

**01:44:32** is there's, they almost never, it's like cuts and edits are very rare. Like the whole thing just

**01:44:38** plays out so slowly and it's brilliant. I love it. But the thing that happens also on this show

**01:44:46** is to mix things up a little bit. You know, they'll visit the first two houses. And then

**01:44:53** they have a little like intermission where they'll often visit some local place in the area.

**01:45:01** And they'll do a little, it's often it's like an arts and crafts section where they're like,

**01:45:06** oh, we've gone to this brewery to help the local brewer brew his beer.

**01:45:10** Here is where they put paper over cheese. And this is what this little, this is little shop

**01:45:16** does is like they make the nice folded paper that goes on top of the cheese.

**01:45:19** Because you definitely, you need a break from all of the hot property action.

**01:45:23** Yeah.

**01:45:23** You got to, you got to calm things down a bit.

**01:45:25** Just a couple of days ago, we saw an episode that I felt like took this to brand new heights,

**01:45:31** which was they visited a button museum, right? Which was just about buttons.

**01:45:41** And CGP Grey visits the button museum.

**01:45:43** Right. And the woman who was in charge of the button

**01:45:46** museum was talking about the history of button making. And I was sitting there on the couch,

**01:45:53** like, wow, this is what I mean by like, you don't have to hit an amazing bar. Like I watch

**01:46:00** escape to the country and find the sections where they go to like, just the local horse

**01:46:07** bribery place, right? Or they're going to take lessons on whatever. Like I find all of those

**01:46:12** sections delightful. And I love them.

**01:46:14** You've definitely set the bar with the button museum. Like you're good now, everyone gets it.

**01:46:20** So that's, I just wanted to clarify on that part of that. So that's year of the voyage.

**01:46:28** Man, I cannot wait for the like kind of pointless CGP Grey travel show. I'm genuinely like really

**01:46:35** excited about it. Because I know it's something that you would be very good at too.

**01:46:42** Here's the thing. Like I don't even really know what I'm doing here. Right. Like, but I just think

**01:46:48** I've been trying to do something like this for a while. And T-Coy was the, was the first time

**01:46:56** I really made something along these lines of like, Oh, I went to a place and just filmed it. And it

**01:47:03** turned into a year long nightmare that exploded in my face. But, but it was like, I was still really

**01:47:09** glad to have done it and gone to this place. And I've also had the frustration of over the past few

**01:47:15** years trying this in a few ways. And like it had just other projects, like just haven't quite

**01:47:23** worked out, but I do feel like again, it will never have the kind of audience that the animated

**01:47:29** stuff does, but there's definitely some section of the audience who does like the vlogs and people

**01:47:37** who liked the T-Coy video and a couple of just like the, you know, the live stuff that I've done.

**01:47:44** And so I feel like if I'm going to try to set an explicit goal to explore this more,

**01:47:53** this is the year to do it. This is the time to do it as a way to trick and force myself

**01:48:03** out of this really comfortable shell that I've been living in for the past year. And so it's,

**01:48:09** it's also why like, I'm very happy to kind of put myself on record by making a call to the audience

**01:48:16** of like, get in touch if you, if you think you're at an interesting place. And, you know, I don't

**01:48:24** know if worldwide travel is a thing that's going to happen this year, but I feel like I can, I can

**01:48:29** safely negotiate UK wide travel no matter what happens. I'm not going to lie. This is my favorite

**01:48:37** of your themes. Okay. I wasn't sure what your reaction would be. I feel like this is a little

**01:48:42** ridiculous and weird, but that's kind of why I like it. It's, it's got like a real practical element

**01:48:48** and then like an interesting like challenge. And then also this spectacular little project in the

**01:48:56** middle. I'm glad you like it. Now I do have a sub theme, but I cannot continue onward with the

**01:49:04** show without knowing what your theme is. Like I need to know what are you, what's, what's the mic

**01:50:52** of this show and relay FM the year of reinvention. Oh, okay. So I have like an overall kind of like

**01:51:02** statement to it. And then in my usual way, a bunch of little things that letter up into this

**01:51:07** wider theme. So the second half of 2020, maybe like the last three quarters, I guess,

**01:51:15** has seen just an immense amount of change in my professional life. And I mean, this was

**01:51:23** encapsulated by the year shift, right, like everything I had to do to get where I needed

**01:51:28** to be where I wanted to be to achieve what I had set out that year to start achieving,

**01:51:33** you know, just to get all those things done was harder, right, like getting the journal ready,

**01:51:38** like the plan was always the second edition will be ready now. And like even doing that

**01:51:44** was monumentally more difficult because of COVID. Right. So just getting to that part to get to now

**01:51:52** was just just saw a lot of change and a lot of things that I had to do differently. And 2021

**01:51:59** is going to be focused on making these things regular parts of my life, permanent things. So

**01:52:08** the stuff that I want to do in 2021, it's not all brand new, but all of these parts

**01:52:16** add up to the new overall thing. So I was really like the working title of 2021 was year of new

**01:52:25** and I but I didn't want to make it that. And then the more that I've kind of focused on these

**01:52:32** elements, I came up with reinvention. So like the world is going to be different post pandemic

**01:52:40** and so will I maybe in more of a way than I would have thought. So got a bunch of things here. Okay.

**01:52:48** New outlets for myself is one of them. One of the things that I really wanted from the year

**01:52:55** of refinement was hobbies, right? New hobbies. And I have ended up walking into some of them

**01:53:00** just over this last few months and building and customizing mechanical keyboards has been

**01:53:09** that thing for me. This was the thing that came up on the show a long time ago. And we spoke about

**01:53:14** it a while ago. And I've kind of been talking about my journey a little bit more in Moretex,

**01:53:20** which is our members show. You can go to getmoretex.com and you can sign up. And I've

**01:53:26** been kind of like checking in with you on this along the way. And at this point, this has become

**01:53:32** something that I have absolutely loved this year is finding this new hobby for myself and being

**01:53:40** able to do something with my hands and learn skills and take in knowledge and information

**01:53:49** in a world that I knew nothing about or didn't even know existed. So that's been like,

**01:53:56** a real great outlet for my energy. And the type of media and entertainment and information that

**01:54:04** I can consume in this world is a really great distraction from other things. Because there's

**01:54:14** very little realistic practical overlap with the rest of my other pursuits. Like there are things

**01:54:22** that are similar, you know, like you use these keyboards with your computer, right? Like they

**01:54:27** are electronic, you know, and there are like these parallels with design and aesthetics, right?

**01:54:35** But it's not like how gaming and technology are basically the same industry.

**01:54:41** Yes. Yeah. This is too much overlap.

**01:54:43** Too much overlap. And this is way less overlap. And so I've been really enjoying it for that.

**01:54:50** And I still have more to say on that, but that's coming in a later part of the theme.

**01:54:55** But just general like hardware tinkering is something that I also want to do a little

**01:55:00** bit more of because now I'm getting a little bit more comfortable with electronics. Because you

**01:55:08** kind of have to learn some of the basic steps in like building keyboards, right?

**01:55:13** You know how to solder now.

**01:55:13** I know how to solder now. So stuff like that is like it's bringing down some of those barriers

**01:55:19** from a world of technology that before now I've been kind of like that I couldn't even begin to

**01:55:24** understand that. It's like one thing that I want to do, which is similar to this in some ways is

**01:55:28** I want to build a new PC. So that's going to be something that I'm going to do early in the year.

**01:55:33** But in general, outside of these things, I want to find and continue to identify new places for

**01:55:41** my energy and my creativity. There were times in 2020, especially like many people where I felt

**01:55:48** stuck in a rut. I'm going through the motions here. So I want to continue to feed my desire

**01:55:57** for new things and new interests that I've always had and continue to have. And it's one of the

**01:56:02** things that I think is best about me and why I can have the type of career that I have in the

**01:56:09** type of podcasts and media that I create is that I have an insatiable need for new information

**01:56:17** and curiosity and finding out about new stuff. And I want to continue to feed that about myself

**01:56:22** because it is what makes me feel creatively fulfilled. Like I notice about myself,

**01:56:29** one of the problems that I've fallen into in the past is that it meant that I needed to make new

**01:56:33** podcasts about them. And I have definitely been able now to decouple that, that I don't have to

**01:56:40** make a new podcast about everything that I'm interested in. This is something that I have

**01:56:45** learned over the last couple of years and that this actually dovetails into. But what it doesn't

**01:56:51** mean is that I can't do stuff with this information. So with keyboards, keyboards have brought Twitch

**01:57:00** streaming back into my life. And for the last two or three months, every single week, at least once

**01:57:07** a week, I have been doing a Twitch stream focused around keyboards and it's been really great. And

**01:57:14** so this is part of the next thing, which is doing something new. And I have been setting this thing

**01:57:20** up so that in 2021, it can become a more permanent fixture in my life again. And like video, right?

**01:57:28** Because I love video. I love things in video. Video has lots of considerations and things to learn

**01:57:33** and things to get better at. But I hate editing video. Right. And so I stayed away from video.

**01:57:42** I like the production of making it and everything that goes into it, but I don't like all of the

**01:57:46** stuff that happens after it. You don't have to edit Twitch videos because it's all live and what

**01:57:53** you do is done. And that's it. When I press stop broadcasting, I can just go on with my life.

**01:57:58** There's no more. And I really like that about the medium because I'm used to producing live,

**01:58:05** you know, like I do it all the time. It's not a concern for me. It's very easy for me to do that.

**01:58:10** It's part of my skill set. And being able to do this stuff with Twitch is great because I don't

**01:58:15** have to do something that I consider to be really difficult. You know, I video editing is much more

**01:58:20** time consuming than audio editing. I can do it. I'm happy with my ability and my skill. I just

**01:58:26** don't enjoy it. And so that I really like Twitch streaming for that. And it's really great to build

**01:58:32** this new little community and new interest. And I've been super pleased with my progress so far.

**01:58:40** And I'm really, really enjoying the Twitch streaming stuff. But there's something that

**01:58:46** goes alongside all of this, which I hadn't realized was important to me, which is building

**01:58:52** something that belongs to me only. I don't have this. I am genuinely blessed to work with

**01:59:03** some of the most interesting people I've ever met. And I love working with all of the people

**01:59:08** that I have the pleasure of working with. But I also have to collaborate with all... I can't

**01:59:16** just make decisions in the content that I produce and no one can tell me I don't want to do that,

**01:59:22** or I would prefer to do it this way, or why don't we try it that way. I don't have something that's

**01:59:28** only mine. I have co-hosts, I have partners in all of my endeavors. And in the last 10 years,

**01:59:39** maybe even more, my whole creative professional life for all of my endeavors, someone's been

**01:59:47** there with me, which has so many upsides. But I haven't had my own space to do my own thing

**01:59:58** about something that I really care about. And what I love about the keyboard stuff

**02:00:04** and the Twitch streaming that go together is that all of this is completely unconnected to my

**02:00:11** previous endeavors. No one else that I know is into this like I am. This is something that I found

**02:00:20** on my own and I love. And you have a keyboard and you love your keyboard.

**02:00:28** Yes, that's correct. I have a keyboard and that is where it ends.

**02:00:31** Right, but it's something that you care about is having the tool that you like.

**02:00:35** And my co-host on Upgrade Jason, he has a similar thing where he has a keyboard that he likes and

**02:00:40** he went through a process of finding the one that worked for him and then stopped. But this is an

**02:00:47** area which is constantly evolving and there's all these cool designers and there's all these

**02:00:51** artisans and there's actually quite a lot of parallels with my pen hobby and the keyboard

**02:00:58** hobby. They have similarities, which is how this whole thing began. But this is a thing where

**02:01:04** nobody that I work with cares really about this world like I do. And it's a whole world

**02:01:13** of content creators and designers similar to the world that I'm in, but it's over there and it's

**02:01:21** and I'm really loving trying to get into this world more and learning what it's all about and

**02:01:28** the terminology and who the cool people are. And it's like this whole thing. And I love that

**02:01:35** it's everything I'm building is just mine. So like, it's like working on the branding of it all.

**02:01:41** I am the one who makes the final decisions and all of that and what it all means and what it looks

**02:01:46** like and what the content I'm going to do is and when I'm going to do it and how often and how long

**02:01:53** and everything is just mine. And I am really enjoying all of what that means for me. And it's

**02:02:01** so far been a very refreshing thing and has been a great thing to have on my calendar to look forward

**02:02:09** to every week and to make headway in. It's been fantastic. I've loved it. Having side projects in

**02:02:16** general is healthy for me. If I'm able to learn new things along the way, it's a great bonus.

**02:02:23** And what I'm really enjoying about this whole thing right now is that I'm starting to build a thing

**02:02:29** which is meaningful to me and is my thing to move forward. And I'm loving that.

**02:02:35** I have to say, talking to you over the course of this year, you have been so genuinely happy

**02:02:43** when talking about keyboards and so engaged with it. And I've been startled at how huge this world

**02:02:52** is that you've shown me. Another thing like my dad always said that everything is a world unto itself.

**02:03:00** And with the keyboard thing, you can just pick anything and your first reaction is always going

**02:03:04** to be like, how much can there possibly be to this? And the answer is infinity. The answer is

**02:03:09** always infinity. It's never not. It doesn't matter what you're picking and what you're thinking about.

**02:03:14** And yeah, I feel really happy to have seen this interest be developed and cultivated by you and

**02:03:26** made into a thing with your Twitch channel and developing the branding around the Twitch channel,

**02:03:32** which is just entirely yours and very Mike. And I like this. I like that this is something

**02:03:39** that you're continuing forward into 2021. And I like that it's me. The branding is Mike Dot Live.

**02:03:48** That's the branding of my Twitch channel when it's the URL. And it's my name. And I like that.

**02:03:55** Like it's something that's just mine. And I reserve the right to do other things on that

**02:04:02** Twitch channel and I will. But its core focus right now is this new hobby that I am just greatly

**02:04:11** enjoying tinkering with and learning more about. And so it's been a great thing for me over the

**02:04:17** last few months. And I think it's going to be something that I'm going to continue to enjoy

**02:04:21** into 2021. Building new norms is another part of this. Okay. Looking at what this last year has

**02:04:29** been like and what it's going to mean for my future. One of these things is a permanent

**02:04:37** reduction in travel. Hmm. Even when I can do this again, when I could in theory be on the road

**02:04:45** once a month, every month. I'm not going to do it anymore. Okay. Okay. Do you have

**02:04:52** specific limits? Like this is really interesting. And I can totally see how

**02:04:57** you could start to think about this as a, how is my life going to be different? How am I going to

**02:05:02** reinvent what my life is? Like what are you thinking around this? I do not have hard and

**02:05:10** fast limits. Okay. But I know it's going to be way less. There was a lot of travel that I was

**02:05:18** doing, which was superfluous really. It was just like, this would be nice to do. And I'm not going

**02:05:23** to do any of that anymore. And a lot of the travel that I will do needs to be vacations if it's going

**02:05:35** to be anything, I think. Hmm. Right. We'll come back to vacations in a minute, but there's, there's

**02:05:42** been a change in my priorities. And there was a time. So I was talking to a friend about this

**02:05:50** a couple of days ago and he said to me, he said something to me, which has really helped me

**02:05:54** understand this. There was a time in my life when I needed to travel more to help establish

**02:06:05** my working relationships. Hmm. And I don't need to do that anymore.

**02:06:10** You know, there was, there was a time five years ago when going to all these conferences was

**02:06:15** beneficial to me for building what would help be my future career. I do not need to do that anymore.

**02:06:26** And there are things which are really important for my business, which I'll always travel for.

**02:06:32** There are certain events which are important and they're going to continue to be important.

**02:06:37** And I'm going to continue to do them, you know, but there is also a lot of travel that I was doing

**02:06:43** to attend a conference that I was just kind of interested in, but I didn't need to do it.

**02:06:49** But I wanted to go to the place and I wanted to experience that part of the world.

**02:06:54** But I'm just, it's such a big thing to keep taking all this time. This cost,

**02:07:03** this effect every time I make one of these trips. And I just, I have found out that I don't need it.

**02:07:12** I just wanted it. And I just don't, I know I don't have to continue doing this.

**02:07:19** And so it's going to be something that I reduce a lot. Wow. I mean, I was always

**02:07:28** impressed and shocked with the number of times that you would fly to America. But again, I think

**02:07:38** this year has definitely shown that the world can keep spinning with a dramatic reduction in travel.

**02:07:45** And yeah, I mean, this is also one of the interesting things about having,

**02:07:49** you know, having spoken to you for years and doing this show for years is, I wouldn't have

**02:07:55** thought about it until you just mentioned it now, but I think you're totally right that you're

**02:08:00** always moving through different phases of your life and your career. And it's easy to continue

**02:08:08** doing the things from the previous phase without reassessing them. This does feel like it's a good

**02:08:15** one to reassess and one that is thrown into sharp relief because of this previous year.

**02:08:21** Yeah.

**02:08:22** I mean, yeah, I know you don't have hard limits on this.

**02:08:26** I'll be curious to see what does this actually translate into over the next year.

**02:08:32** I think the biggest, like when I talk about the biggest reduction will be in travel for work,

**02:08:36** right? Yeah.

**02:08:38** That's going to be the big reduction.

**02:08:41** Yeah.

**02:08:41** I may have taken 10 work trips a year. Maybe it will be three.

**02:08:45** Mm-hmm.

**02:08:46** And I don't know hard and fast what it's going to look like yet,

**02:08:51** but I know that I am committed to it being less, like a lot less.

**02:08:55** Yeah. And this also feels much bigger than just a, like a yearly theme subsection. This feels a

**02:09:01** little bit, I mean, I don't know if I'm overstating it from your perspective, but it does feel to me

**02:09:07** a bit like a recognition of a probably, if not permanent, very long-term change.

**02:09:17** Like I'd have a hard time imagining a three years from now, like, you know, being in a situation or

**02:09:23** a position where you're like, I want to fly to America every month for work. It's very difficult

**02:09:28** to imagine that.

**02:09:28** But I mean, that's kind of my theme this year is very much drawing a line.

**02:09:36** Mm-hmm.

**02:09:36** And there was pre-2020 Mike Hurley and Post. And this last year has crystallized a lot of stuff

**02:09:47** for me. And even if these things, some of these things sound like the types of things I would

**02:09:53** have spoken about before, I just need to really try and get across that. In my mind, I think I'm

**02:09:59** thinking about them very differently and very definitively. And these things are different.

**02:10:04** I mean, so like, there are things which sound like stuff I've spoken about in the past, and I

**02:10:10** still have a couple more little things to talk about, but they are very much like, I have spent

**02:10:18** time understanding who I am and what I want to be. And that's what I mean by the year of reinvention.

**02:10:29** It's like, I understand who I am. I understand what I do. And I understand how I react to things.

**02:10:36** And this year move and then moving forward is a lot of me leaning into what I want to lean into

**02:10:44** and pulling back on what I think needs to change.

**02:10:46** Okay. I feel like I have a much deeper understanding now of reinvention.

**02:10:50** Yeah. Yeah. Vacations.

**02:10:54** Okay.

**02:10:55** I just have to take more of them.

**02:10:57** More than none of them?

**02:10:58** Is that what you mean? More than none of them?

**02:10:59** More than none of them. Yeah. More than none of them. And even if and when things return to a more

**02:11:04** like 2019 like feel that I need to be switching off more. I don't have a plan for that. Like I

**02:11:13** really don't, but I have recognized that it is something that I need to work on this year

**02:11:21** for the future. That my vacations, quote unquote, were they were tricks. Right? Like,

**02:11:29** Oh, I'll take a few days off because I'm going to X place. And I mean,

**02:11:35** ostensibly it's a work trip, but it's going to feel like a break because it's not

**02:11:39** like my normal life.

**02:11:42** Yeah. That is a real trick for yourself. I've done that. Oh yeah.

**02:11:47** It's a vacation.

**02:11:48** I'm still going to record all the shows I'm recording, but I'm doing them with different

**02:11:50** views. So it feels like a vacation. Like, no, I, all right. I know I have a weird job and I have

**02:11:58** a fun job and a job that lots of people would want, but I work hard and I work long hours.

**02:12:05** And I feel like at this point I've put in enough time that I can actually start taking some

**02:12:11** vacations, like real weeks off. And so that's the thing that, again, I don't know how much of

**02:12:20** this realistically I'm going to get to do in 2021, but this isn't about just 2021.

**02:12:25** Like this is about like taking a little bit more control of this stuff

**02:12:31** for now. And then moving forward, direct support. So membership has been, you know,

**02:12:39** as we mentioned in kind of the wrap up of 2020 has been like a really, really great thing.

**02:12:44** But I know now that this is going to continue to be something which is going to continue to get

**02:12:50** focused from me moving into the future. This wasn't just a 2020 thing to help kind of get us

**02:12:56** out of a bad spot. It's like, no, this is a legitimate way as a creative professional

**02:13:02** to make a portion of your living. And I want to continue to explore what that means.

**02:13:09** And continue to take guidance from people like you as to what it means to be a creative

**02:13:18** professional who relies on support from an audience directly. And so, you know, I'm really

**02:13:26** happy with where I've gotten to with this show and with the other shows that I produce that have

**02:13:31** membership content. But I want to play around with what that means, what that content can be

**02:13:39** and where it can be pushed to. And I want to keep moving this forward in 2021

**02:13:47** into different areas and see what feels right.

**02:13:50** Oh, man, like every... This is like the biggest theme that you've ever done. I feel like every

**02:13:56** one of these little subsections is like a giant bomb of things to be processing, just even as

**02:14:03** you're saying it. So yeah, that is another entire thing that could have been a theme unto

**02:14:10** itself, but is also extending to the future of forever.

**02:14:13** It's a groundwork year. 2021 is a year of like laying the groundwork for future things.

**02:14:22** There's going to be a lot of exploration for me in really trying to understand kind of like

**02:14:29** what my next 10 years are going to be like. So like I didn't talk about it because we were in

**02:14:36** a weird time, but 2020 was 10 years for me in podcasting.

**02:14:42** Wow.

**02:14:43** So it was in April. I've been doing this for a decade. And like, it just wasn't a thing to

**02:14:48** celebrate, right? We were like three weeks into lockdown. So I just kind of kept it to myself.

**02:14:54** And I wanted to do something to mark the time, but I never did. So from 2021,

**02:15:01** I am hopefully moving into my next decade. And if that's going to be the case,

**02:15:10** it feels like a time to be like, all right, what did you learn over the last 10 years?

**02:15:15** Let's keep moving forward. 10 years doesn't mean anything. We've spoken about this in the show,

**02:15:19** but as human beings, we'd like to round things up. It's like the fact that we do the yearly themes in

**02:15:25** December, January, right? As you said, really, it could be in February if you wanted to. It doesn't

**02:15:30** make a difference. We could do nine monthly themes, right? Everything's arbitrary.

**02:15:35** This show could just be a theme for the month. Every month, that's it. Right? But like we like

**02:15:40** to kind of like to look at things in these nice little neat compartments.

**02:15:45** Yeah. And 10 years of anything is a big deal. It's why the decade transitions are a big deal.

**02:15:50** That's why it has a word.

**02:15:51** Human civilization thinks about 10 year periods at all. Like what were the 90s like? What were

**02:15:58** the 2010s like? Yeah, it's arbitrary, but it has meaning. It has meaning.

**02:16:06** I'm happy I started in 2010 because I can always just round it to the 10s.

**02:16:14** I'll always have that, right? 2010 to 2020, 2020 to 2030, you know? And so, you know, it just feels

**02:16:21** like that to me of like, what'd you learn in the last 10 years and how do we move them through to

**02:16:26** the next 10? And I was just forced in 2020 to rethink a lot of stuff. You know, this may have,

**02:16:35** what I'm doing right now, this like taking stock and what do I want this next long-term period to

**02:16:39** be like? It might have been what I always did because of this 10 years thing, but I was forced

**02:16:45** to look at my work in a much harsher light than I normally do because of the pandemic. And it has,

**02:16:55** I think has helped me realize the things that like I care about the most and the things that I

**02:17:01** also have ignored where I shouldn't have, you know? I have two more.

**02:17:07** Yeah, go, go.

**02:17:08** All right. Cortex brand product development. We have finally, hopefully,

**02:17:16** gotten the theme system under control, right? So the journal now is what I want the journal to be.

**02:17:24** It's what I've always wanted it to be. It is where we think it is best for its long term.

**02:17:31** We have gotten it into a place where we are happy with the production. I'm much happier with the

**02:17:36** timelines of things. My expectation now is it should be a manageable part of our business

**02:17:43** that we should just be able to look at stock levels, we reorder, and it keeps going from there,

**02:17:48** right? That is what we have spent the last 18 months working towards. And, you know, it was a

**02:17:56** punt that ended up turning into a thing. And, you know, now going into where we are now, going into

**02:18:03** 2021, we're hopefully going to get a much clearer idea as to what the theme system means

**02:18:10** for our company. But it's taken this long to get to here. My hope in 2021

**02:18:19** is that we will now be able to look at new products. Like, as we said this before, but

**02:18:28** Cortex brand was never supposed to be just the company that we had that makes the journal.

**02:18:33** Right. Yeah, it's not the journal company dot brand, right? It was always supposed to be a

**02:18:41** bigger thing with more products. It's just product one turned out to be an enormous deal.

**02:18:51** And also was a really hard thing to make. And then we had a pandemic to deal with. And then,

**02:18:58** you know, and then and then and then we have the next areas that we want to pursue. And so I'm

**02:19:05** hoping that 2021 will see the first of those. I think that would be really great. And then the

**02:19:12** last thing I want to talk about for now is mega studio. So this is a much more short term part

**02:19:18** of the year of re-invention. It isn't it doesn't really ladder into the re-invention theme at all,

**02:19:24** honestly, but it's just a thing that I really want to achieve this year. So it's going in and

**02:19:29** the whole shoe on in it in. That's fine. That's very acceptable. The studio over the last nine

**02:19:36** months has felt like it's been in a permanent state of being unfinished. Yeah. There's been

**02:19:44** a lot of stumbling blocks outside of our control, you know, like the ability to use it the way that

**02:19:50** we first imagined using it. We couldn't like I've had to both me and Edina have had to maintain

**02:19:55** home office setups as well, which was the whole friggin point of getting this space was that we

**02:20:00** wouldn't do that anymore. But we've had to keep it because we've we're not sure if how long we can be

**02:20:07** here for, you know, like if we need to lock down again or if we want to lock down again or whatever,

**02:20:13** you know, so that that's been tricky. But having this space has been the best part of my professional

**02:20:21** life this year, because it's provided me with the mental clarity and strength to do everything else.

**02:20:31** Without this space, I would be in a much worse mental place right now. Because considering I've

**02:20:39** taken no time off, if I would have been at home every day working for this whole nine months,

**02:20:44** probably would have lost my mind somewhere in the middle of it. You know, talk about burnout. I know

**02:20:50** I would have burnt out big time during that period of time. And being able to for the time that I've

**02:20:59** been able to be here, which unfortunately has not been as much of the year as I wanted to be right

**02:21:03** there was a what like March to June period where I wasn't here at all. But the the act of getting up,

**02:21:14** getting ready, coming to the studio, doing my work, coming home, being at home, that has helped me

**02:21:21** like a lot, a lot. And it has been this fantastic new thing for me that has also enabling

**02:21:31** other things. I can only do all the keyboard stuff and all the Twitch streaming stuff because

**02:21:36** I have this space. I couldn't do all of it at home. It just wouldn't be possible for me to be

**02:21:41** able to have this stable video environment, which I can have here, because I have space here to set

**02:21:47** things up the way that I want and to as my needs and use cases adapt, I can adapt with it.

**02:21:55** But unfortunately, I've yet to be able to get this place into some kind of stasis.

**02:22:02** You know, there are so many things that keep changing. And I've yet to even be able to set

**02:22:07** this working environment up the way that I want. And there's still a lot of stuff. I mean, honestly,

**02:22:12** like even this isn't a big thing, but just like the computers that I'm using keeps changing.

**02:22:18** And that is causing frustration in it, right? Like I can't even get that set.

**02:22:24** And like all work environments, me and Adina have been learning how we want to use this space.

**02:22:31** And I feel like we have a much better idea of it now. And I'm just hoping that in the next few

**02:22:36** months, we can move further towards getting it set the way that we want to. So that in 2021,

**02:22:45** you know, by the end of 2021, I want to have removed my home office,

**02:22:51** but we're going to have to wait and see if it's possible to do that.

**02:22:57** I would like to pitch to you how this is part of year of reinvention.

**02:23:03** Okay.

**02:23:04** I view this as the caterpillar that was 2019, Mike, began to spin a cocoon that was Mega Studio.

**02:23:17** Mm. Okay.

**02:23:19** Right. And that cocoon spinning took a much longer time than expected.

**02:23:28** It was a big old cocoon.

**02:23:30** Right.

**02:23:31** Yeah, run out of silk halfway through.

**02:23:33** Yeah. But as the year of reinvention, this is your pushing off platform for 2021, Mike and beyond.

**02:23:45** So that that's the way I think, yes, you getting it finished and set up this year is a smaller

**02:23:52** target, but it is to complete the work that past you started to enable the thing that is

**02:24:02** the base of the reinvention. That's my pitch to you on.

**02:24:06** No, I like that.

**02:24:07** I think this is still connected.

**02:24:08** You've said something now, which I seem to have kind of got it wrong in the order,

**02:24:13** like Mega Studio is the top of this list because without it, I am not able to do these other things.

**02:24:20** Because part of the reason that I don't feel the need to travel as much anymore

**02:24:28** is because I'm not at home all the time, working from home, being at home,

**02:24:32** you know, I used to like to travel because it would break up my life a bit.

**02:24:39** But being here does that, you know, like I'm in a different area of London when I'm here.

**02:24:46** I'm traveling. I'm getting the feeling of being on the move.

**02:24:49** It's giving me more activity and I can explore different new things here.

**02:24:55** You know, like I am in a better area here for walking around to different stuff than I am

**02:25:02** where we live. Again, we haven't been able to really put that into practice because the types

**02:25:08** of things that we would go to, we don't go to them in COVID times. We will again.

**02:25:13** And so it does enable all this other stuff and also is for my business, a different financial

**02:25:22** commitment. So like I have made the decision to have this studio at the expense of even being

**02:25:32** able to travel as much as I would before because I have a new financial commitment to make sure

**02:25:36** that I maintain, you know. So you are right. And I like that you said that and that's actually

**02:25:43** really helped kind of crystallize that part of why this fits into my year of reinvention.

**02:25:51** So that is my theme, Gray. It's a big one.

**02:25:55** Oh man. It is the biggest one ever.

**02:25:58** This for me though is the, it goes back to what we were talking about at the beginning of the show.

**02:26:05** I can't complete anything in here. There's nothing to complete. Everything has no end.

**02:26:14** The point is that by the end of 2021, my goal is to look back and say that I have moved the needle

**02:26:22** on all of those things, but none of them have like a point that I get to in the year. I'm like,

**02:26:31** tick, I've done it because none of these things have a defined end to them. They're all things

**02:26:40** that by the end of the year, I want to have progressed in some way that I can look back and

**02:26:46** be like from where I was in December, 2020 to December, 2021 and say like, yes, I have moved

**02:26:54** forward on all of these fronts.

**02:26:56** Would you like to hear my sub theme?

**02:26:57** I would, yes.

**02:27:03** This is a very different year, I think for both of us. You have this big

**02:27:07** overreaching, epic, decade long start to your theme. I think I've never had anything that's more

**02:27:16** specific and sort of bitty.

**02:27:18** And like, it's kind of fun in a way as well.

**02:27:23** Yeah, yeah. Maybe whimsical.

**02:27:25** Yeah, whims is a good way to describe it.

**02:27:27** And so I'm going to continue with that because I think there's some part of my brain which after

**02:27:34** the amorphous fuzziness of Year of Clarity has been craving some more specific things.

**02:27:43** And so there is this sub theme that I do want to mention because it feels like an important

**02:27:51** lesson learned from Year of Clarity.

**02:27:55** And so the sub theme to continue with the nautical metaphors here is clear the decks.

**02:28:02** Mm hmm.

**02:28:03** So I've really learned something as well about myself this year.

**02:28:09** It's something I've kind of been aware of, but it really crystallized in this past year,

**02:28:15** which is going back to human interest.

**02:28:19** Like why are humans interested in things?

**02:28:22** And I think one of the best ways that I can know what my own internal emotional state is

**02:28:32** is expressed in how much do I find things interesting?

**02:28:37** And this year, I know that I've been doing great, that it's not like some trick of the brain to

**02:28:45** cope with what was actually disaster because I've never been so interested in almost everything.

**02:28:58** You can laugh.

**02:28:59** It's perfectly fine.

**02:29:00** As an example, I find history mostly really boring, but this year it's like, oh, I've read

**02:29:07** a lot about the Cold War, which I feel like in almost any other time, I would just be like,

**02:29:11** oh, this is boring.

**02:29:12** Who cares?

**02:29:12** But again, you can't explain interests.

**02:29:16** I've never had a year where I feel like my brain has wanted to go in just so many directions.

**02:29:23** And this comes and goes, and I feel like, oh, it's just a good barometer for emotional well-being.

**02:29:33** It expresses itself as interest in things.

**02:29:39** But everything comes with costs, and being interested in lots of things is great,

**02:29:45** but you have to direct that.

**02:29:49** And this is where the topic lock that I talked about came into play.

**02:29:56** For clarity in what I'm working on, I'm going to pick some projects as locked and consider,

**02:30:03** like, I'm going to work on these and I'm not going to switch topics.

**02:30:08** Like, I'm going to get it finished so that I know what am I actively working on.

**02:30:15** But here's the thing, like, brains are tricky.

**02:30:20** You can't trust brains.

**02:30:22** They're always trying to find ways around your rules.

**02:30:25** And one of the things that my brain totally did this year, which compounded on itself

**02:30:33** over the months as they rolled by, which was locking a topic.

**02:30:40** And then I would finish the video on that topic, but I would tell myself repeatedly,

**02:30:49** oh, there's a lot of these little things that I'd like to, quote, follow up, quote, quickly

**02:30:56** about related to this main video.

**02:30:59** And so I spawned in my mind, like, very many little follow ups or light gray video ideas

**02:31:08** that were supposed to attend the main videos.

**02:31:12** And this is just one of these ways where it's almost hilarious to me how your brain can trick you

**02:31:19** because it's like when I put up a main video, have I ever quickly wrapped up a little follow up

**02:31:27** within the next few days after the video goes live?

**02:31:31** No, never, never.

**02:31:32** Like, I am like a, you know, a snail curled up in a shell after the video goes up.

**02:31:38** It's exhausting.

**02:31:39** And I know from experience that I can never actually do any of these things.

**02:31:43** But because I was just so interested in so many things, like, I just had all of these little,

**02:31:49** like, residue ideas left over after the main video on something was done.

**02:31:57** And my brain was sneaking these past the topic lock idea of like, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah,

**02:32:04** no, this isn't this isn't a video.

**02:32:05** This is just a little thing.

**02:32:06** This doesn't count.

**02:32:07** Don't worry about this.

**02:32:09** You can you can now lock what the next topic is.

**02:32:12** And somehow you'll wrap up these little extra videos really quickly in your spare time.

**02:32:20** You know, perhaps you'll work on them in the afternoons when you know from full experience

**02:32:24** that you work terribly and inefficiently and don't ever never try to do writing in the afternoon.

**02:32:28** But maybe you'll finish writing them up then because they're quick and easy.

**02:32:32** And so clear the decks is a sub theme that is really important to me.

**02:32:38** Phase one is I've got way too many of these little, like, open boxes in some sense around

**02:32:45** of things that I wanted to follow up on videos that I have done this year that I just didn't

**02:32:53** that that didn't work out because how were they ever going to work out?

**02:32:58** Like, when was I going to work on these?

**02:33:01** Not in the morning when I was working on the locked topics.

**02:33:05** You know, like, it just wasn't it just wasn't ever going to happen.

**02:33:08** So I am, you know, when Christmas rolls around and it's it's the new year,

**02:33:14** January is a famously slow time on on YouTube in particular.

**02:33:21** I'm really going to go through everything that I thought I was going to follow up this year

**02:33:27** and make some really harsh decisions about closing these topics down for good.

**02:33:36** It's like, yes, the main video is up and these additional ideas.

**02:33:40** I am putting them away in storage.

**02:33:44** They're going to have to go because we need to clear the decks for the year that's coming up.

**02:33:52** The second part is me realizing, OK, topic lock was a great idea,

**02:34:00** but I need to get around my Trixie brain and recognize that topic lock has to be bigger

**02:34:10** than I was originally thinking about it.

**02:34:14** If it is to be taken seriously, it has to mean the main video and also anything that you think

**02:34:24** is going to follow up that video so that I cannot lie to myself that the quick and easy videos

**02:34:34** that should follow up a main thing that they are not still under topic lock, which means

**02:34:41** if they're going to get made, they have to use up the prime hours in the morning of writing time.

**02:34:50** They have to use up the prime hours of directing time and thinking about the visuals and everything

**02:34:55** else. I'm really happy that I've over the past year been able to make those light gray and those

**02:35:02** easy videos, but the videos that did happen still occurred when I took them seriously as,

**02:35:10** yes, this is a light gray video, but it is topic locked.

**02:35:13** Oh, no, I get it.

**02:35:15** OK.

**02:35:16** Yeah, I thought you were saying like, I'm not going to do those.

**02:35:19** And I was going to say, I don't think that's a good idea.

**02:35:20** But now I get it like you.

**02:35:22** You will give those videos the same treatment.

**02:35:26** Yes.

**02:35:26** Right.

**02:35:27** They have to get the same treatment.

**02:35:30** Everything has costs.

**02:35:31** The whole reason that I'm able to do the job that I do

**02:35:35** is because I will become interested in lots of things.

**02:35:39** And I like connecting different topics and I like exploring and trying to figure out what

**02:35:44** are the useful things here.

**02:35:45** But like, I really have to constrain it.

**02:35:48** And topic lock out of year of clarity felt like the first correct tool that made a big difference.

**02:35:55** And this is clear.

**02:35:57** The decks is like an extension of that idea.

**02:36:01** OK, dude, you can have

**02:36:05** three topic locked things at a time.

**02:36:08** But when you want to bring up a new thing on deck to be worked at,

**02:36:15** everything related to this topic has got to go back below decks.

**02:36:20** You can't tell yourself, oh, I just have a two minute extra idea that's going to go along with this.

**02:36:27** No, you don't.

**02:36:28** You either finish this one before we bring up the new stuff

**02:36:32** or we make the decision that this is not going to happen.

**02:36:37** And it's just interesting because like rolling into this December,

**02:36:42** I had a hilarious, hilarious number of quick little videos that kept getting pushed back into December

**02:36:52** that I was like, oh, yeah, it's totally reasonable that in December I'm going to have

**02:36:57** seven tiny videos that are following up all of the things that happened this year.

**02:37:02** And it's like it was never going to happen.

**02:37:04** And I walked into that trouble by not being really serious about it.

**02:37:09** And because I found myself like spread across too many of the things that I was

**02:37:15** interested in from over the whole year, it's like, oof, I put the December video

**02:37:21** in like a shaky position of getting made because it was just spread across.

**02:37:25** Oh, yeah.

**02:37:26** Yeah, there's the main video for December and there's also going to be all of these other things.

**02:37:30** And it was just like a trick.

**02:37:32** So for me, when I was talking before about this idea of integrating spaceship U into my life,

**02:37:44** like very deeply, this is also part of it.

**02:37:49** And it's why the reason like I've chosen language that matches up with vessel language.

**02:37:55** It's like keeping the decks clear is just as important as all of these other things.

**02:38:02** And like you, you made steps in the right direction last year, and we just need to tighten

**02:38:09** this concept to make it flow more smoothly.

**02:38:12** So that is my sub theme going into next year is like clear the decks phase one, make decisions

**02:38:19** about which of these are actually going to happen and be treated seriously in the production

**02:38:25** process, even if there's still light videos and which of these almost certainly many of these,

**02:38:31** am I going to make a decision?

**02:38:33** No, like that's just not going to happen and that's fine.

**02:38:36** And then after that is done, keeping the decks clear and not letting this like tricky expansion

**02:38:46** take place that slowly caught up with me over the course of the year as it progressed.

**02:38:52** So that is my sub theme.

**02:38:54** All right.

**02:38:54** I think that's the early themes.

**02:38:56** That is yearly themes.

**02:38:57** This is an epic yearly themes episode.

**02:39:01** I know.

**02:39:02** If you want to send in your yearly theme, ask cortex questions for next time.

**02:39:06** I think we might do some of those.

**02:39:08** You send a tweet with the hashtag ask cortex, or you can use question mark ask cortex in the

**02:39:14** relay for members discord.

**02:39:15** If you have a yearly theme that you want to share, you can share it that way.

**02:39:18** You can also share it in the subreddit.

**02:39:20** I really love it when people share their themes.

**02:39:23** Like I think these episodes are, they're a big deal for us and it's, it's really enjoyable

**02:39:29** and rewarding to see like what people are doing in their own lives with their own themes.

**02:39:35** And it's, it's definitely one of the nicest and best times around the subreddit.

**02:39:40** And I also think it's a great tool for people who are thinking about this for themselves.

**02:39:44** So I really encourage everyone to, to share their themes.

**02:39:48** In the subreddit.

**02:39:50** And once you have shared your theme, there's no better way to put it in place than with

**02:39:56** the theme system journal that is here and is magnificent.
