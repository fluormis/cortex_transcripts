# Cortex - 131: A Truly Epic Sense of Denial
**00:00:00** I'm prepared for a pretty odd episode today, to be honest.

**00:00:03** I think, uh, listeners, Mike and I are quite a pair today, I think.

**00:00:09** There's a reason it's been a thousand years between episode recordings.

**00:00:15** How you doing, buddy?

**00:00:16** We'll talk about this in a little bit more detail later on, but I'm in a bed.

**00:00:20** I'm in a better place now than I've been so far.

**00:00:23** I'll put trajectories and all that. How are you?

**00:00:25** I'm not entirely sure where the stock market of me is right now.

**00:00:29** Let's just say COVID has had a 100% success rate in the last two months in Cortex.

**00:00:36** That's set in the stage.

**00:00:37** You know, the last time we spoke, it was me, just me, you know?

**00:00:41** Now, it's both of us.

**00:00:43** Yeah, it's both of us.

**00:00:45** I messaged you and I was like, Mike, whatever is the furthest day from now that we can possibly

**00:00:53** record this show, that has to be the recording day.

**00:00:56** And today is that day.

**00:00:59** My expectation is it really is the very, very last moment when this episode gets posted,

**00:01:04** which we are contractually obligated to post said episode.

**00:01:09** But before we get to all of that, I wanted to let our Cortexians know about Moretex.

**00:01:14** You can go to getmoretex.com and you will get yourself longer ad-free episodes of not just

**00:01:20** this episode of Cortex. We're going all the way back multiple years for bonus content,

**00:01:25** so you get an extra segment at the end of every single episode if you're in Moretexian.

**00:01:30** And if you want to go right the way back to the very beginning of this show,

**00:01:34** every single episode of Cortex has no ads in it for Moretexians.

**00:01:38** And remastered in higher audio quality as well.

**00:01:43** That's my favorite part, remastered editions.

**00:01:45** For your listening pleasure.

**00:01:47** And as I said before, in case you've forgotten over the last couple of years,

**00:01:50** you probably have because who keeps track of this other than me?

**00:01:53** There are subtle tweaks to some of the episodes.

**00:01:56** Some of the timing has changed a little bit in some of the episodes.

**00:01:58** I've gone in there and give it the mic of 2021 hands rather than, you know, 2016.

**00:02:05** He didn't know what he was doing.

**00:02:06** So you can always go and get that at getmoretex.com.

**00:02:09** But now as an added bonus, our 2022 crossover special is now available.

**00:02:15** So over the last, I think maybe six years, we've gotten together with Jason Snell,

**00:02:20** who I host the Upgrade Podcast with.

**00:02:23** And we were doing a bunch of text adventures.

**00:02:25** And the last two years, we've recruited our friend Tony Cendela

**00:02:28** to be a game slash dungeon master for us.

**00:02:30** We've been going through an RPG, an epic RPG adventure story,

**00:02:34** which this time had us dealing with a supply chain crisis.

**00:02:40** It was a great time.

**00:02:41** We put it together.

**00:02:42** It came out a little bit late because I wanted to give it the editing touches

**00:02:46** that I always give it.

**00:02:47** So lots of sound effects and stuff like that.

**00:02:49** Because of COVID, it took longer than I wanted.

**00:02:51** But it is available now.

**00:02:53** All Relay FM members get this in the crossover feed.

**00:02:56** But if you become a More Texan, you also get the crossover feed,

**00:02:59** which has bonus specials from a bunch of Relay FM shows

**00:03:02** going all the way back to like 2015, 2016.

**00:03:06** So there's tons of fantastic content in there for you,

**00:03:09** along with the longer ad free episodes of More Tex every month.

**00:03:12** So go to getmoretex.com and you can sign up today.

**00:03:15** I don't want to spoil it for anybody.

**00:03:18** But in this most recent members episode,

**00:03:20** you created what may be the best sound effect that has ever existed in a podcast.

**00:03:25** I really appreciated your editing work on this one.

**00:03:28** It really made me laugh.

**00:03:29** I will say that that's a particular thing.

**00:03:32** Many people have contacted me to tell me how weird and or funny they found that,

**00:03:37** which is hilarious to me because when you mentioned it,

**00:03:40** I did not know what you were talking about.

**00:03:42** I had no memory of it.

**00:03:44** Because there's so many, I make so many peculiar choices.

**00:03:48** There's a ton of Easter eggs in the editing of this that really only I will ever get.

**00:03:53** So like another little spoiler,

**00:03:54** there's a moment where two pieces of music are playing over each other.

**00:03:58** One of them, which you would not be able to tell

**00:04:00** because of the way I edited it, is the Girl from Ipanema,

**00:04:03** which is a long running Cortex joke at this point.

**00:04:07** So that's in there.

**00:04:08** Yes, I didn't even catch that one.

**00:04:10** I didn't catch it. It was the Girl from Ipanema.

**00:04:11** No, because there's another piece of music laid over the top of it.

**00:04:14** It's inaudible.

**00:04:16** But it's in there, you know?

**00:04:17** It's in there.

**00:04:18** So there's a ton of great stuff.

**00:04:20** You can go and check it out for yourself.

**00:04:21** Getmoretex.com.

**00:04:23** Now, before we get into the meat of the episode today,

**00:04:27** I just wanted to put something on your radar.

**00:04:30** So you know I'm a big keyboard boy, you know?

**00:04:32** Yeah, I know you're a big keyboard.

**00:04:33** Got my keyboards, doing my Twitch streams, all that kind of stuff.

**00:04:35** Yeah.

**00:04:36** There is a company that has a licensing deal with Wizards of the Coast.

**00:04:42** Oh, yeah.

**00:04:42** Producing Magic the Gathering, keycaps, desk mats, and cables.

**00:04:47** And I just, one, wanted to let you know this is happening.

**00:04:50** And two, I just wanted to know, like, does this keycap set really say

**00:04:55** Magic the Gathering to you?

**00:04:56** Okay, I love that.

**00:04:57** Does it do the job?

**00:04:58** Okay, I love that.

**00:04:58** Like, I don't understand what a magic cable would be.

**00:05:01** I just caused...

**00:05:02** Oh!

**00:05:03** Oh, see, it's hit something.

**00:05:05** Okay, okay.

**00:05:06** I was like, how much do I need to explain this?

**00:05:08** All right, this makes...

**00:05:10** I was like, what on earth could this possibly be?

**00:05:12** But as soon as I clicked it, it's like, oh, this makes a million times more sense.

**00:05:16** Okay, so for non-fans of Magic...

**00:05:18** Muggles.

**00:05:19** I think they're called Muggles.

**00:05:21** No, that's not...

**00:05:21** No?

**00:05:22** No? Is that wrong?

**00:05:23** It's creature-type human is what they are.

**00:05:25** See, that was a joke I don't get.

**00:05:27** Don't worry about it.

**00:05:27** I can imagine there are a bunch of people like, hahaha, right?

**00:05:30** You know, like, I don't know.

**00:05:31** 95% of our audience just shrugs that one off.

**00:05:34** Yeah, so roughly every season or so, they come out with a new collection of cards.

**00:05:39** The new cards always have a little theme that goes along with them.

**00:05:43** But this year, they kind of broke tradition a little bit.

**00:05:47** And they came out with a theme that instead of basically everything is like,

**00:05:53** medieval magic land, like, you know, very traditional fantasy kind of stuff with little

**00:05:58** spins on it.

**00:05:59** This time they went to...

**00:06:00** They had a set that came out and it was like, oh, it's the future.

**00:06:04** And it's in our fantasy version of Japan.

**00:06:06** And everything is neon.

**00:06:08** And I freaking loved it.

**00:06:11** Like, I think they did an amazing job.

**00:06:13** And they made it seem like it really fit in with the game, even though it was really out there.

**00:06:18** But it also makes a thousand times more sense.

**00:06:21** So like, oh, if you were going to try to license cool looking USB-C cables and keycaps,

**00:06:29** you would pick not magic as a whole thing, but this particular set of cards and the

**00:06:35** aesthetic to be like, look, it's all neon and cool.

**00:06:38** Like, I like the colors of this a lot.

**00:06:40** Yeah.

**00:06:40** I really don't like the legends or the cool, but like the characters, the letters and the keys,

**00:06:46** I can see where it's come from.

**00:06:48** This is the fun of the game, which I get.

**00:06:50** Let me see.

**00:06:51** Like, if you go to the keycaps, you scroll down the page, you see like an exploded view

**00:06:55** of all of the keys.

**00:06:56** Oh, I see.

**00:06:57** It's got that like magic, the gathering font to it.

**00:07:00** Yeah, I really don't like that.

**00:07:01** But like, I understand why they've gone that route.

**00:07:04** It fits.

**00:07:05** But this is one of those things where it's like now kind of to me, they've made this product

**00:07:10** just for Magic, the Gathering fans, which I know that there are many and I'm sure it

**00:07:13** would do very well.

**00:07:14** But yeah, it's interesting.

**00:07:16** I can see what you mean.

**00:07:17** I feel like, yes, that font does not look great on keys.

**00:07:21** I do think it's cute.

**00:07:22** They have, I guess those are the escape alternates are the five different mana symbols,

**00:07:27** the little sunshine, water drops, skull, fireball and tree.

**00:07:30** So I guess those are alternates for escape.

**00:07:32** Yeah, well, you could use them anywhere on the top row of the keyboard.

**00:07:34** There's like the same.

**00:07:35** Okay, so there's like the function key stuff.

**00:07:37** Interesting.

**00:07:38** It's a very complete set, I would say, for like fun stuff.

**00:07:41** And they've done a decent job, I think.

**00:07:43** Yeah.

**00:07:44** And they've got a bunch of like the desk mats, you know, like that you put down on the desk,

**00:07:47** but you keep on top of they like down the page too.

**00:07:50** And they've got like a bunch of amazing designs.

**00:07:52** And I assume there's some kind of like big boss monsters from Magic, the Gathering.

**00:07:57** Yeah, we got Jin Cataxes there.

**00:07:59** Oh, no.

**00:08:00** And obviously, beside you who endures, you know, everyone.

**00:08:03** Yeah, that's a tree.

**00:08:04** That's not a boss beside you is the name of a tree.

**00:08:06** But nice try.

**00:08:08** I mean, the tree could be a boss.

**00:08:10** You know, Mike, that's ridiculous.

**00:08:12** Yeah.

**00:08:13** Come on.

**00:08:14** Why would the tree be a boss when there are dragons?

**00:08:17** Yeah.

**00:08:18** Yeah.

**00:08:18** So I think the answer to you is that this doesn't scream magic to me.

**00:08:23** It screams Kamigawa and Neon Dynasty, but they did a great job.

**00:08:26** And it's funny to see.

**00:08:28** And never in a thousand years would I have imagined that you would have ever had

**00:08:34** any piece of Magic, the Gathering related anything to pass on to me.

**00:08:39** So thanks for that.

**00:08:40** This is fun.

**00:08:41** I don't think this will be the last one either.

**00:08:43** So like this company, Clack Keys, they have they've got the licensing partnership with

**00:08:49** Wizard of the Coast now.

**00:08:50** So if this one does well, I'm sure they'll do more.

**00:08:54** And I think you're right.

**00:08:54** Like they chose maybe the one that they could most easily translate visually to something that looks

**00:09:01** like really appealing to a what like amount of people.

**00:09:06** Yeah.

**00:09:06** Yeah.

**00:09:06** This would be this would be the best one to start with for sure.

**00:09:10** Interesting.

**00:09:10** I'll be curious to see if they do.

**00:09:13** Nuka Pena is the next set, which is like art deco stuff, which yeah, I'm a big fan of art deco,

**00:09:20** but I just as much as Kamigawa was awesome and it totally worked.

**00:09:24** I really am not a big fan of the Nuka Pena art deco stuff.

**00:09:27** Like I just think it sticks out in the game like a sore thumb.

**00:09:30** It is like, oh, they had a real high.

**00:09:32** And then what I think is like a real low.

**00:09:35** Okay.

**00:09:35** I'm looking at some of these cars.

**00:09:36** They look nice on their own, but maybe that's the problem.

**00:09:39** I do think you could make a pretty sweet looking keyboard with like art deco design.

**00:09:45** So Nuka Pena, not an amazing magic set, but probably an amazing keyboard.

**00:11:42** So today's episode, originally, I was considering that we would do a review of our yearly themes so

**00:11:52** far, because we haven't really spoken about them very much since say January, February time.

**00:11:56** Like that was something that I was thinking we would do today.

**00:11:58** Long ago in January or something we discussed, oh, we should halfway through the year talk about

**00:12:04** our themes.

**00:12:05** Yep.

**00:12:06** And I put on my little calendar as like, oh, mid-year theme review.

**00:12:10** I've been looking at that coming up on the calendar with a lot of mixed feelings,

**00:12:15** as I imagine you might be feeling.

**00:12:17** Well, basically, I think we're both going to talk now a little bit about our COVID experiences

**00:12:23** and how it's affected our work.

**00:12:26** And essentially, it has made a pretty big impact on my year theme.

**00:12:33** So I've kind of taken a look at my theme a little bit more.

**00:12:38** And I've actually been able to flesh it out a little bit more because of this.

**00:12:41** Oh, okay.

**00:12:42** And so I do want to talk a little bit about my theme today, but it's not all what I was expecting.

**00:12:47** You know, what I was originally planning to do today was to talk about how my year has changed

**00:12:52** so far with the year of structure and kind of how I'm doing.

**00:12:56** I'm probably now just going to leave this until the end of the year and kind of talk about some

**00:13:04** more things that are being added in or changed to my year theme because of having COVID.

**00:13:11** So the year of structure, that was my whole idea.

**00:13:15** And really, the idea of it was to put some immediate plans in place, but ultimately be

**00:13:22** thinking about what changes would I make for next year moving forward.

**00:13:27** So it was like a foundationary year, really.

**00:13:29** It's like setting the structure for the future.

**00:13:32** And this past two months has really kind of recommitted me to making some more immediate

**00:13:41** and short-term actions rather than just, I've done a few things now.

**00:13:46** I'm going to just keep this in mind for a while until I get ready to work out for 2023.

**00:13:51** What stays, what goes.

**00:13:53** So as a little bit more background as a conclusion to my trip, right?

**00:13:58** So cast your mind back to the WWDC me in San Jose with COVID.

**00:14:05** The world's saddest boy.

**00:14:06** World's saddest boy.

**00:14:08** The second half of the trip was way better.

**00:14:10** We were able to leave San Jose because we had to, we got kicked out of our hotel.

**00:14:16** I tried to extend it, but really I did want to go.

**00:14:19** So we were able to move to San Francisco.

**00:14:21** I started to feel better there.

**00:14:23** And I was able to like, there was just more to walk around and just be a little bit more active.

**00:14:29** And it just felt, it felt a little bit more removed from the sadness, you know,

**00:14:34** because I wasn't in that same place anymore.

**00:14:36** Yeah.

**00:14:36** We did then get stuck in Dallas again for a day.

**00:14:40** We had another connecting flight issue.

**00:14:42** So back in Dallas, back in the same hotel, went back to the same place for lunch as we did in

**00:14:46** March and then came home again.

**00:14:48** It was just, you know, but this was different though.

**00:14:51** We knew before we got on the plane, okay.

**00:14:53** Okay.

**00:14:54** That it was going to happen.

**00:14:55** We actually like, we could see that delays, delays, delays.

**00:14:58** So we ended up changing our trip and ended up taking a flight just to Dallas.

**00:15:02** And then the next day going home.

**00:15:04** I feel like Dallas is just like has a magnetic force pulling you towards it at this point.

**00:15:09** Like, like at some point you're going to be trying to fly to Paris and still end up stuck

**00:15:13** in Dallas for a day.

**00:15:14** So I'm just going to wait for that to happen.

**00:15:18** It's like the Bermuda triangle for me, right?

**00:15:21** Now I am like eight or nine weeks, I think since catching COVID initially.

**00:15:27** I am a long COVID sufferer because I still do have symptoms.

**00:15:32** I am on an upward trajectory.

**00:15:34** Some of the symptoms took a couple of weeks to drop off and you know, so they're like one by one,

**00:15:39** I'm losing them.

**00:15:41** Mostly now I still get a little chest pain.

**00:15:43** I still get a bit out of breath.

**00:15:45** I've seen a doctor, everything I've got is consistent with long COVID and I've had a bunch

**00:15:49** of like tests done to make sure there hasn't been any damage and it doesn't seem as any damage.

**00:15:54** Now it's just the case of me waiting it out.

**00:15:57** When you talk about damage, are you talking about like lung capacity tests?

**00:16:00** Is that the kind of thing?

**00:16:01** Yeah, lung damage, heart damage.

**00:16:03** We've looked for these things.

**00:16:04** Oh, okay.

**00:16:05** A lot of the symptoms that I have, it seems like it can be you've either got long COVID or you've

**00:16:10** actually had something go wrong because of having COVID.

**00:16:14** Nothing seems to have been a fact.

**00:16:15** I did like this whole like lung study thing where I had to like do a bunch of breathing tests

**00:16:21** and everything seems basically fine.

**00:16:24** You know what I say?

**00:16:24** Obviously we did do a test beforehand so we don't have a baseline to compare it to,

**00:16:28** but I'm within regular range.

**00:16:32** The doctor did tell me something really interesting because one of my main symptoms right now is I

**00:16:38** get out of breath quite frequently and also sometimes quite randomly.

**00:16:42** And he was saying that one of the things that he has observed or has been observed

**00:16:49** is that what it seems like is there's nothing actually wrong with the lungs.

**00:16:53** It's that your brain and your lungs kind of get out of sync from each other and you think you

**00:16:58** don't have enough breath, but you do, but you start to breathe differently.

**00:17:03** It's like there's something about COVID which gets them out of sync.

**00:17:07** And he says in most people and in himself, just all of a sudden one day, it just goes away.

**00:17:12** So I'm just waiting for that day now for it to go away.

**00:17:15** So very strange.

**00:17:16** That is very strange.

**00:17:18** But all of this is to say the effect that COVID has had on me has been playing on my mind.

**00:17:26** So over the last two months, it's been harder for me to produce shows.

**00:17:30** Like I've not had the same level of energy for the first month.

**00:17:35** Every show that I would do would completely wipe me out.

**00:17:37** I would be exhausted afterwards.

**00:17:39** It would have a burning sensation in my chest.

**00:17:42** It was rough.

**00:17:44** So this has kind of given me a bunch of things to start thinking about.

**00:17:48** I realize I'm bad at resting.

**00:17:52** This is people were telling me from the beginning to rest, but I am very much,

**00:17:57** my mentality is if work is to be done, I want to do it.

**00:18:03** I still have this like I have to work feeling or that I need to be the one doing everything.

**00:18:08** Like if I want things to be done right, I need to be involved in them.

**00:18:13** And this is purely a me problem.

**00:18:18** It's not like I don't trust my colleagues because I take vacations every year and have no problem

**00:18:23** with that.

**00:18:24** And I'm fine with everyone looking after for me.

**00:18:27** But if I'm sick, I want to work because there is something in my brain, which is definitely wrong,

**00:18:34** which is saying you can just do this.

**00:18:38** You'll be fine.

**00:18:39** You can just do it.

**00:18:40** And so now that I am doing a better job of realizing this, I've been taking a longer

**00:18:46** look at myself, thinking more about what I want to be doing with my life.

**00:18:52** And I definitely know, as I did at the start of the year, that I want to be able to reduce

**00:18:59** my working time to be able to spend more time not working, spending time with family,

**00:19:05** taking more time for me.

**00:19:06** And I have done some of that this year, but being sick like this has reminded me I need

**00:19:13** to do more so that when I get myself in a situation like this, the amount of work that

**00:19:19** I feel like I need to do is already smaller.

**00:19:23** Like when you said before about making short term changes, like what time scale is short term?

**00:19:31** Because I'm just thinking your podcasting schedule hasn't really changed since the

**00:19:37** start of the year until now.

**00:19:38** That workload is still the same.

**00:19:40** So that was always the thing of like, I didn't want to cancel any shows this year.

**00:19:45** Yeah, yeah.

**00:19:45** For a bunch of logistical reasons, it's not great to just do it.

**00:19:50** It's just complicated.

**00:19:51** It gets complicated.

**00:19:52** And so the plan was that before we started with the 2023 planning, that I would have an idea as

**00:19:59** to which shows I would stop doing.

**00:20:02** So I'm still working on that.

**00:20:04** Because it's very complicated.

**00:20:06** And it comes with a lot of emotion.

**00:20:09** And it comes with the impacting other people.

**00:20:11** So I'm still finding it very complicated.

**00:20:14** But I'm feeling better about it.

**00:20:18** I have made some some shorter term changes now.

**00:20:23** Like some I've done some stuff to try and help with the balance and with finding structure

**00:20:27** in different ways.

**00:20:28** And then I've also got some things that I'm going to be doing over the next couple of weeks.

**00:20:32** The biggest change that I've made is I have let go of the edit of upgrade.

**00:20:39** Oh, wow.

**00:20:40** This is very difficult for me.

**00:20:42** I have edited this show every Monday, pretty much for seven years.

**00:20:49** I can't I can't believe you're letting go of the

**00:20:51** edit for upgrade.

**00:20:52** Wow.

**00:20:53** How you feeling about that?

**00:20:54** Not good.

**00:20:55** I'm not good.

**00:20:56** Not good.

**00:20:57** Not good.

**00:20:57** So this is nothing on who we've got to do it.

**00:21:03** So I'm using our friend Jim Metzendorf.

**00:21:06** He is an incredible audio editor.

**00:21:08** He's better than me for sure.

**00:21:11** He edits a bunch of my shows and a ton of shows at Relay.

**00:21:15** So it's nothing about this.

**00:21:18** It is letting go of it.

**00:21:20** Like I feel like I have been able to craft some of the show in the edit.

**00:21:26** If I'm editing, all I have to do is just have trust in me to get it right.

**00:21:30** I just I don't have to think about anything.

**00:21:32** It's it's I just do it.

**00:21:34** But now I'm I'm letting that part go.

**00:21:37** And then Jason is going to be posting the episodes instead of me.

**00:21:41** And so it's like, I'm letting go.

**00:21:44** I'm having to let go of the control of that part of the process.

**00:21:51** So like the show will probably be posted.

**00:21:54** When I'm asleep now, which makes me feel very uncomfortable as well.

**00:21:59** I don't blame you for feeling uncomfortable with that.

**00:22:01** But it's time.

**00:22:04** So the reason that I chose to do this is it is between one to two hours of work every week.

**00:22:14** But it's not the amount of time.

**00:22:16** It's the time in which it happens.

**00:22:19** So the beginning of the edit of upgrade begins around seven to eight p.m.

**00:22:27** on a Monday.

**00:22:30** And I don't want to be working that late anymore.

**00:22:33** Like I don't want to still be in the studio at nine, 10 p.m.

**00:22:39** I don't want to do it.

**00:22:41** And so that's why this is one of the immediate things that I'm changing.

**00:22:47** It starts with the next episode.

**00:22:49** So the first of August, Jim helped out with some stuff that we did in a previous episode

**00:22:53** with some guest interviews.

**00:22:55** But the actual like letting go of the entire of the show starts in August.

**00:23:01** There is a bittersweet feeling to it for sure.

**00:23:03** Like I will be happy for the time.

**00:23:06** I want the time.

**00:23:07** I want to have the freedom more of like we finish and then I just leave.

**00:23:13** Mm hmm.

**00:23:14** But it's something that I've taken great pride in, too.

**00:23:18** So it's hard to let it go.

**00:23:20** But if I can't do this, I'm never going to be able to cut anything else.

**00:23:25** Right.

**00:23:25** This is one of the most simple things in theory for me to get rid of.

**00:23:30** There is no reason for me to still be the one doing this.

**00:23:34** I'm not bringing any particular skills to the edit of these episodes.

**00:23:39** I like to tidy them up.

**00:23:40** I go through them and then I add in the metadata that we need.

**00:23:44** You know, it takes time because I put time into it.

**00:23:47** But like Jim will put more time into it.

**00:23:49** The show will come out better because the thing that I don't do for upgrades

**00:23:53** and for time to listen back to large portions of the episodes, which he will be doing.

**00:23:58** So the edit will take longer, but it will still come out Monday.

**00:24:01** But it will come out later on Monday.

**00:24:03** But I can't spend that amount of time because then I'm working till past midnight.

**00:24:07** Right.

**00:24:07** You know, right.

**00:24:08** And so it's a no brainer to do, especially because I've done it for so long too.

**00:24:14** But it's just really difficult to let go of this part of the process for me.

**00:24:19** I think this also, I mean, obviously this is always a thing that I am sensitized to, but

**00:24:25** you're also getting rid of that pressure every Monday.

**00:24:29** This needs to go up today.

**00:24:30** This is the schedule.

**00:24:31** It needs to go up today.

**00:24:33** And you're also staying late at the office to get it done.

**00:24:37** Yep.

**00:24:37** Like removing that.

**00:24:38** I also, I think that will have a bigger effect than you think.

**00:24:42** It's just like, just like the relief of it's not even, oh, this is an hour.

**00:24:48** It's like, oh, it's an hour or two before I can go home late on a Monday because a thing has to happen.

**00:24:54** I felt it before.

**00:24:55** Like I used to edit connected and then when we had to change times and record later and I said,

**00:25:01** I couldn't do it anymore.

**00:25:02** And Steven very thankfully took over the edit.

**00:25:04** And I remember what that was like.

**00:25:06** It actually became even easier for me to enjoy the recording of the show.

**00:25:11** Because I was not thinking, oh, I still got to edit this.

**00:25:14** Or like, you know, there's like a thing going on in the episode and I'm like,

**00:25:17** oh, this is going to be hard to edit.

**00:25:19** Right.

**00:25:19** These two guys are clowning around, right?

**00:25:22** Now I'm sure Steven feels like that, but he's a trooper.

**00:25:26** And, but I mean, is he, the thing is like, it's the time.

**00:25:30** Like if, if me and Jason were able to record at 12 PM, my time,

**00:25:35** it wouldn't be an issue for me to keep doing the edit.

**00:25:37** It's not the amount of time it's taking.

**00:25:39** It's the time in which it's occurring is the, has become the problem for me.

**00:25:44** It is time for me to let go of this, but it's just a thing, which is like,

**00:25:51** wow, I've always considered this as like part of the thing.

**00:25:55** This is part of the show.

**00:25:57** It's like my edit is part of the show, but I've been able to give up a bunch of

**00:26:03** issues.

**00:26:04** This was the last one really technically.

**00:26:07** I still do the edit for the pen addict and for the back markers, which is like my pen

**00:26:11** show, my F1 show, but the edit for those is take the files, match the audio, put them into logic,

**00:26:18** match up the music, export them.

**00:26:22** There is an editing going on in those.

**00:26:24** Like I'm not going in and tightening stuff up and cutting things out.

**00:26:28** And then with the member shows, right?

**00:26:29** Then there's two files.

**00:26:30** You have to then take the second file, remove all the ads, make sure the time is all there,

**00:26:34** upload to, you know, it's long.

**00:26:36** It's a longer process, but with the other two, it's like, it's nothing.

**00:26:39** So all I will be actually, actually editing is this show.

**00:26:43** I think you should give up even the technical editing of those other two shows though.

**00:26:46** It takes 10 minutes.

**00:26:49** I know.

**00:26:50** I like here.

**00:26:51** I hear you say that.

**00:26:53** I still feel like you should give that up.

**00:26:55** Right.

**00:26:56** If it, if it, no, no, no, don't get, don't you have me on this.

**00:26:59** No, I really, there's no need, especially for the pan addict, especially for the pan addict,

**00:27:04** because when I record it, all I'm doing is waiting to start connected, which happens

**00:27:09** like an hour later.

**00:27:11** So I can't really get involved in anything particular or any other big projects.

**00:27:15** It is nothing for me to take those files.

**00:27:17** Like I'm hearing all these words.

**00:27:20** I time tracked.

**00:27:21** It takes 15 minutes for me from the, when we record to when I publish, I'm look, hey,

**00:27:28** I've already done a big thing here.

**00:27:30** Yeah.

**00:27:31** You gotta like, just leave me be for a little.

**00:27:33** No, no, I, I believe you.

**00:27:35** I'm just let me just put this over here for you to think about that part of trying to make

**00:27:41** your life easier is even like what you've done with upgrade here.

**00:27:45** It's not the time, like it's not the amount of time it's when it happens and it's one

**00:27:49** less thing to worry about in trying to make life simpler.

**00:27:53** A really key feature is the absolute number of things that you have to think about and

**00:27:59** reducing that number.

**00:28:01** And I feel like people really do get tripped up in having a very large number of teeny,

**00:28:07** tiny things.

**00:28:08** Each one of which is like, oh, this is nothing, but they do add up.

**00:28:12** And so that's why I feel like, oh, Mike, if this, if this story that you're telling me

**00:28:16** is true, that it's no big deal to do this, then it really should be no big deal to pass

**00:28:21** it on and to just have something that you never have to think about again.

**00:28:24** But I'm like, look, I'm not going to push it.

**00:28:26** I'm just mentioning it here.

**00:28:27** You keep, you keep doing what you want.

**00:28:28** And we'll talk in December.

**00:28:30** This episode of Cortex is brought to you by Sourcegraph.

**00:28:34** So you've hired a brilliant developer.

**00:28:36** That's great.

**00:28:36** But now you have to get them on board it.

**00:28:38** If your company's growing on boarding, new developers will be a common occurrence,

**00:28:42** but it's a huge undertaking every time.

**00:28:44** One of the biggest challenges for new hires is to get up to speed with the project that

**00:28:48** their team is working on.

**00:28:50** This can be tricky if the code bases your developers are working in are already large.

**00:28:54** Well, thankfully, Sourcegraph makes it easy to move fast, even in those big code bases.

**00:28:59** Developers know that knowledge is most useful when it's findable.

**00:29:02** Centralization is helpful.

**00:29:04** But given the fact that most companies store knowledge in at least two different locations,

**00:29:08** how do you make that knowledge accessible to those that need it when they need it?

**00:29:12** As a code intelligence platform, Sourcegraph gives developers what they need to drive their

**00:29:16** own learning over time and in different situations.

**00:29:19** Teams of out Sourcegraph need to rely on asking colleagues or reviewing out-of-date

**00:29:24** documentation, which is cumbersome and time-consuming.

**00:29:27** But with Sourcegraph, every developer can search across millions of repositories to

**00:29:31** find specific code, saving time for themselves and everyone else.

**00:29:35** So when questions do come up, you know it's the big stuff that's worthy of the extra time.

**00:29:39** Sourcegraph was created to make developers' lives easier.

**00:29:42** And today, they work with leading companies across every industry,

**00:29:45** including three out of the five top tech companies,

**00:29:48** plus PayPal, Uber, Playa, GE, Reddit, Atlassian, and many more.

**00:29:52** Visit about.sourcegraph.com to learn more today.

**00:29:56** That's about.sourcegraph.com to find out why some of the biggest tech companies in the world

**00:30:00** use Sourcegraph and to see what it can do for yours.

**00:30:04** Or just click the link in the show notes to let them know you heard about them from this show.

**00:30:08** Our thanks to Sourcegraph for their support of this show and all of Relay FM.

**00:30:12** But I'm not going to give up the edit for this show.

**00:30:14** It's a whole different beast.

**00:30:16** That's never going to happen.

**00:30:17** And I will say this now.

**00:30:19** It's never going to happen.

**00:30:20** It's too complicated.

**00:30:22** I'd be too particular.

**00:30:24** I would still not be able to leave it alone.

**00:30:27** So really, in my mind, the only show I'm actually editing is Cortex now.

**00:30:33** Right.

**00:30:33** The others, it's a different process.

**00:30:35** No matter what Grace says, it's just assembling.

**00:30:37** It takes 10 minutes.

**00:30:38** Right.

**00:30:38** And I'm totally fine with it.

**00:30:39** Very easy to outsource.

**00:30:41** Yeah, but then you add time and money.

**00:30:46** Anyway, the amount of work that they take, I just don't think is even worth somebody's time.

**00:30:52** Yeah.

**00:30:52** I'm not pushing you on that now.

**00:30:54** All right.

**00:30:55** All right.

**00:30:55** All right.

**00:30:57** So that is one thing.

**00:31:00** That is the biggest short-term change because it has long-term ramifications.

**00:31:07** Mm-hmm.

**00:31:08** And I've done a couple of things to try and detach more from work outside of work time.

**00:31:15** And I would like to reintroduce to the show my friend focus modes.

**00:31:19** Oh, right.

**00:31:19** Okay.

**00:31:20** So being on iOS 16, so much easier to set them up.

**00:31:24** I now have a weekend focus mode and a weekend home screen.

**00:31:30** And I'm using the sleep focus mode now too.

**00:31:33** Oh, were you not using the sleep mode before?

**00:31:35** No, I had no reason.

**00:31:37** I don't do sleep tracking, although I'm thinking about trying it out.

**00:31:39** I'll get to that in a bit.

**00:31:41** And I don't want Apple to be setting an alarm for me every day.

**00:31:44** I just set my own alarms.

**00:31:45** Mm-hmm.

**00:31:46** Okay.

**00:31:46** So I never felt like I needed it, but now I've done it just so it does the screen dimming and all

**00:31:51** that kind of stuff because then it's forcing me to think about the fact that you're going to bed.

**00:31:56** Yeah.

**00:31:57** But the main reason I did it is I am now no longer looking at my phone in bed before sleep.

**00:32:05** Okay.

**00:32:05** So when I go to bed now, my iPhone's in the sleep mode and it's got the sleep focus going on.

**00:32:12** And I have previous sponsor, not sponsor, Audible.

**00:32:14** I'm listening to audio books now.

**00:32:16** So I get into bed, get my AirPods, price plan on audio book, put the sleep timer on, put my head

**00:32:23** down.

**00:32:23** I have a really dumb question here.

**00:32:25** I don't know what the sleep timer does.

**00:32:27** I see that as a button and I've always wondered, what does this do?

**00:32:30** Oh, when it hits the time limit, the audio just stops.

**00:32:34** Oh, okay.

**00:32:35** So it's, it's for me, right?

**00:32:37** Like I put on like 30 minutes and then leave it because if I didn't, it will play the whole

**00:32:42** book by the time I woke up in the morning.

**00:32:44** Oh, okay.

**00:32:45** Because it would just keep going, right?

**00:32:46** Okay.

**00:32:46** That makes sense.

**00:32:47** So you're not listening to sleep stories.

**00:32:49** Like you're listening to an actual book.

**00:32:51** Currently I'm listening to a book called After Steve, which is about Tim Cook and Johnny Ive.

**00:32:59** Which is very interesting, actually.

**00:33:01** I'm enjoying it so far.

**00:33:03** But what I'm having to do every morning is try and find the part where I fell asleep.

**00:33:08** I think that's what always hung me up on the sleep timer.

**00:33:10** It's like, what problem is this solving?

**00:33:12** I don't know if it is solving a problem.

**00:33:14** It's making it so that the book hasn't, because it's way easier to find where I was within a

**00:33:20** 10 minute window than it is within a six hour window.

**00:33:24** Yeah.

**00:33:24** But I also imagine you must run into the problem where like the book starts to drift into your

**00:33:30** dreams.

**00:33:31** Right?

**00:33:32** I feel like there's got to be a fuzzy border for like, what do you remember?

**00:33:35** I don't remember my dreams anyway.

**00:33:37** So this isn't a problem for me.

**00:33:38** Okay.

**00:33:39** You're one of those.

**00:33:39** All right.

**00:33:40** When something is particularly vivid, but that's rare.

**00:33:43** Like if I wake up and you tell me what you're dreaming about, I wouldn't be able to tell you.

**00:33:47** Right.

**00:33:48** Okay.

**00:33:48** So I've been doing this for a week, right?

**00:33:50** The audio book thing.

**00:33:52** And I'm liking it.

**00:33:53** It's too soon to tell, but what I will say is I have noticed a difference in how I feel in the

**00:33:58** morning.

**00:33:58** How so?

**00:33:59** Well, one, I'm getting more sleep for sure.

**00:34:02** Between 30 minutes to an hour, more sleep every night because I'm getting into bed and putting

**00:34:10** the AirPods in and usually I'm asleep for 15 minutes where before I would be on my phone

**00:34:14** from maybe half an hour to an hour before I would try to go to sleep.

**00:34:19** So the immediate part is more sleep.

**00:34:21** And the other is I, you know, I think potentially being sucked into all of the things that can

**00:34:28** exist on the internet maybe isn't a great way to like set yourself up for sleep.

**00:34:32** Yeah.

**00:34:33** I don't know.

**00:34:33** This is true, but it's what I believe.

**00:34:35** And so I'm working on that assumption.

**00:34:37** And so I think that that's been pretty good for me.

**00:34:40** The weekend focus mode has less social stuff on available, like on my home screens,

**00:34:48** no work apps on my home screens, and I've automated them to turn on as well.

**00:34:53** So it's just trying to like remind me to look at things less.

**00:35:00** It's actually pretty similar to my travel home screen, which is also built as an idea of like

**00:35:06** deprioritizing anything work related.

**00:35:09** So I'm just trying to set up my phone to encourage me to be more present in other things

**00:35:19** than the things that my phone is usually used for when I'm working or in work time.

**00:35:24** So I think that that's actually been pretty nice.

**00:35:26** I've been liking that.

**00:35:27** How long have you been doing it for?

**00:35:28** A week.

**00:35:29** Okay.

**00:35:30** I'm pretty happy with this set up and I'm going to keep tweaking it.

**00:35:33** What I have done, I've done a little bit of the focus mode stuff where it limits notifications.

**00:35:39** And I'm tweaking that with the weekend one, you know, so it just like it hides them.

**00:35:43** And I really like the way I was 16 presents a lot of this stuff.

**00:35:46** Anyway, the notification stuff is grouped together really well.

**00:35:49** There's this new option, like a display option called count.

**00:35:52** And so on my home screen right now, I have the name of my current focus mode,

**00:35:55** which says recording, and it just has the number three next to it.

**00:35:58** And that means that there are three notifications that I can scroll up to see if I want to,

**00:36:02** but they don't put them on the home screen.

**00:36:05** This is just like a general notifications feature that I really like in I was 16.

**00:36:09** Like it's deprioritizing all of the notifications unless I go for them.

**00:36:13** And then if you use some of the tools in focus modes, it then puts them another level down.

**00:36:20** What's the other level down?

**00:36:21** So if I swiped up to see my notifications, there's then like a stack that says

**00:36:26** while in weekend focus, and I have to tap that to see those ones.

**00:36:31** So I don't even glimpse them if I'm looking for other stuff.

**00:36:35** Oh, okay. I see what you're saying.

**00:36:37** Right. Okay. That is that is an improvement.

**00:36:39** That's always been my frustration with this is

**00:36:42** accidentally seeing stuff. Even if it didn't notify me,

**00:36:44** you get the names of the apps, but none of the content.

**00:36:48** Okay, that's better.

**00:36:49** Yeah, it's way better. So I I've been leaning into some of that and I'm, I'm really digging it.

**00:36:54** That's working really nicely for me. Then I have some other things that I am thinking about now

**00:37:02** as part of the year structure. One is how do I spend more time at home?

**00:37:08** I love having my studio and I love being here for work.

**00:37:12** So what this means is not working at home, right?

**00:37:16** It's not just being at home and sitting on my MacBook and doing whatever.

**00:37:20** Right.

**00:37:21** This is like doing things at home, spending time with family, spending time with friends.

**00:37:28** I want to do more like home projects.

**00:37:32** All of this kind of stuff. It's just like a thing that I feel more.

**00:37:37** I think in my advancing age, have more of a draw towards.

**00:37:43** Do you want to, do you want to become handy? Mike?

**00:37:45** Is that what I think?

**00:37:47** Do you want those jeans where you can slide a hammer in the side of them?

**00:37:51** Is that what you're, is that like what you're leaning towards?

**00:37:53** Okay. People get a tool belt for that. They don't put the hammer in the jeans.

**00:37:58** No, you have jeans where they've got the little loops. You can put the hammer in them.

**00:38:02** All right. Clearly you're more handy than me. I didn't know about hammer jeans.

**00:38:06** Yeah. I want some hammer jeans.

**00:38:08** I know where to get you for Christmas.

**00:38:09** I cannot tell you where this feeling is coming from, but it's happening to me.

**00:38:15** Do you want to wire some plugs? Is this that kind of stuff?

**00:38:19** I want to hang some pictures on the wall. I want to build some furniture.

**00:38:23** Like I want to do stuff. I've mentioned this to some other people and they said,

**00:38:27** ha ha, your biological clock is ticking. I'm like, great. Thank you for letting me know.

**00:38:32** But like, I just like, great, you're going to like this. I have found myself smiling at dogs.

**00:38:37** Oh, really?

**00:38:38** Yeah. I see dogs in the street and I'm like, that's a cute dog. And then immediately think,

**00:38:42** why do I care about that? Like, this is part of my brain that's like firing off the dogs now too.

**00:38:47** So something's going on with me. I don't think it was the COVID that did this,

**00:38:51** but it just made me reevaluate some things differently.

**00:38:55** So what I've been wondering is like, if I want to spend time at home,

**00:38:58** I could do some work to like condense my schedule a bit. So for example,

**00:39:03** we'll go back to talking about Mondays, which is when I record upgrade.

**00:39:08** So I try and get to the studio between 10 and 11 a.m.

**00:39:12** And I will do my morning work. I will do all my prep for the show,

**00:39:16** but we don't start recording until five. So I always have a little bit of time in the day,

**00:39:20** maybe an hour or two, depending on what's going on, where I'm just like hanging out here,

**00:39:25** which is nice, but maybe it'd be nicer to do the hanging out at home and come to the studio

**00:39:30** at like 1 p.m. Yeah, for sure. Right. Sure.

**00:39:33** So I'm starting to think about what would that mean? What would that look like?

**00:39:37** And that's another thing that I'm considering of like rejiggering the way that some things are to

**00:39:43** further make like home and work defined. Because like I've been taking advantage while I'm here.

**00:39:48** Like if I have time, this is something I'm doing with the year structure.

**00:39:52** Like if I realize that I have free time to use that for me.

**00:39:58** So I've been playing video games. I've been doing a lot of that this year,

**00:40:01** loads of video games, because that's something I wanted to do.

**00:40:03** It's something I spoke about in the year theme itself of like creating a structure

**00:40:08** for me to be able to enjoy some stuff that I want to enjoy. And this is one of those things.

**00:40:15** But should I be doing that at home and then coming here and just doing the work and then

**00:40:19** leaving? Yeah.

**00:40:20** Rather than there being this like one to two hours in the day where,

**00:40:24** right. So like this is the kind of stuff that I'm starting to think about a little bit more.

**00:40:28** Oh, yeah. No, like you totally want to compress. I'm just thinking of like, oh, you know,

**00:40:33** a morning here and an afternoon there. If you can compress those down, you can like get rid of a day

**00:40:38** at the office or like have a day where it's like almost entirely clear.

**00:40:41** Yeah, I'm trying to do that too.

**00:40:43** Yeah, like I'm having flashbacks to both when I was in college and just being really obsessive

**00:40:49** about that same kind of thing with the scheduling. Like, man, the advantages for like compressing a

**00:40:54** bunch of things that you have to do all into one day and into one afternoon. It's like makes such

**00:41:00** a big difference. So yeah, like when you say you go to the office and you've got like this middle

**00:41:05** time where you can use as personal time, I always feel like that's just it's never as good. Like you

**00:41:12** should be at home if it's going to be personal time and totally rework the schedule. Like I'm

**00:41:18** really glad to hear that you're thinking about that. Yeah, that this one is nebulous, but I had

**00:41:23** like a flash idea the other day, right? I was like, Oh, man, the first place I went to is I got to

**00:41:28** write this down in my cortex notes. Like this is something I want to talk about with Gray, but I'm

**00:41:32** pleased that you feel that way. Then I feel like I'm on the right track for that part. So I don't

**00:41:36** know what that means yet, but I'm thinking about how I can do it. And I do feel like it would help

**00:41:42** me achieve the handymanness that I'm aiming for in my life. The last thing, which is it just doubles

**00:41:49** down on the thing for the future of like the importance of Cortex brand and Cortex products

**00:41:55** to me, which is this idea of what I am calling mostly passive income. Now the mostly part is

**00:42:02** because a ton of work goes into making these products. But once we have something available

**00:42:08** for sale, the amount of work that goes into that product almost disappears for long stretches of

**00:42:15** time. Because one of the things I noticed during my COVID recovery is the sense of understanding

**00:42:23** that my main work right now requires me participating actively in it for it to continue. And for me to

**00:42:32** be able to pay my bills. If I needed to take a break for some reason and the shows couldn't

**00:42:38** be produced, that's a problem. Now the way we have things set up again, if I had to take two weeks off,

**00:42:45** I would be covered. People would help. But that's kind of not the point. It is realizing a risk

**00:42:53** factor in my work. Yeah. And there's a big difference between like, as you can see, oh,

**00:42:58** taking two weeks off, that's very doable. A situation where like, you need to take two

**00:43:04** months off. Like, oh, right now that's a real problem. Because again, like just something to

**00:43:10** underscore like the difference between mine and your major income source. So like for me,

**00:43:17** it's the podcasts and for you as YouTube. Now, once we record and publish our podcasts,

**00:43:22** all the money that episodes ever going to make has been made because of the way we choose to do our

**00:43:27** advertising, which I think is the best way to do advertising, which is we embed it all in the

**00:43:32** episodes is recorded by us. Nothing's being dynamically inserted and that kind of nonsense.

**00:43:37** But with YouTube, if people continue to watch the videos, some amount of money

**00:43:42** continues to be made always. Right. And so for me, if I needed to take two months off,

**00:43:51** I don't know what would happen. Right. But that's what I mean. It'd be a big problem in the current

**00:43:56** situation. Yeah. And so having a line of successful products, which is what we are trying to achieve

**00:44:08** that are then actively sold constantly, does not require the amount of focused effort on a one

**00:44:21** weekly basis that the podcasts do. And so if we can continue finding things that work for people

**00:44:30** like the journal has, that is a very smart thing for me and you. But in this sense, I feel like

**00:44:38** more for me because I don't have this kind of income source right now. It has already been

**00:44:45** a great help this year. And I think we'll continue to be as we have other stuff that we're working

**00:44:51** on. And that's the hope. So that that's like it's reinforced to me something I felt was the case

**00:44:57** anyway. Like I was thinking about this, but now I feel like I have brushed up against the risk.

**00:45:05** Yeah. Because one of the things me and you spoke about a lot during the lockdowns

**00:45:12** was our major worry for COVID considering the type of work that we do was the kind of brain fog

**00:45:21** confusion stuff, which I had a lot of during COVID but has gone away now, I think mostly. How would

**00:45:28** you know? But it's mostly gone away because considering the type of work that we do, which is

**00:45:34** talking for a living, thinking for a living and like communicating for a living. If I can't do

**00:45:38** that effectively, that's a big problem. Yeah. And like I saw some colleagues get

**00:45:44** really screwed by that and it's like, holy moly, this can be very alarming. And so like that was

**00:45:53** like my biggest worry. And so I've brushed up against that now and it's put that fear back in

**00:45:58** me. And so it's made me kind of rethink again about this kind of work. So all of this is my

**00:46:08** kind of like half year refocus on the year of structure. I'm continuing to think about

**00:46:14** what 2023 is going to look like. It's also led me to think a bit more big picture for the next few

**00:46:22** years. All I have as an idea right now is like, what am I able to step away from?

**00:46:30** I don't know what this means, but it's a question I keep asking myself.

**00:46:33** This episode of Cortex is brought to you by our friends at FitBard. Between balancing work,

**00:46:40** family, everything else you've got going on in your life, it can be hard to make fitness a priority.

**00:46:45** What you need is a program that works with you, not against you. And that's why you need FitBard.

**00:47:12** What you need is something that is for you, that is tailored for you. And it's going to work for

**00:47:17** you because that is when it sticks. And you're going to see the results that you're looking for.

**00:48:06** track your muscle recovery to make sure that things are balanced. So you're not going to be

**00:48:09** overworking the same muscles over and over and over again. They balance it out. This also helps

**00:48:15** you stick with it because you're not going to find yourself in pain all the time because you

**00:48:19** continue to work on your biceps every single day for four days in a row. No, you want it balanced.

**00:48:24** Again, these are the things that make this stuff stick. Personalized training of this quality can

**00:48:53** Relay FM. So how's your COVID? Can we get a timeline? Can we get a timeline? Like how long

**00:48:59** have you been dealing with this? So okay, let me set the stage here, which is I went traveling

**00:49:06** with my family. So earlier in the year we saw my wife's side of the family and now we saw my side

**00:49:11** of the family. And at the end of that trip, 100% of us got COVID. Full success, right? Yeah, a real

**00:49:20** COVID clean sweep. So yeah, I was traveling with my family for about three weeks. Very luckily,

**00:49:26** I got it just at the end of all of that. One by one, we started to fall and I was unreasonably

**00:49:34** confident that that's, well, I haven't gotten sick yet, so there's not going to be any problem.

**00:49:40** And then just in the last couple of days, I was feeling a bit off, but I swear, just like with

**00:49:45** the first time, I have some kind of mental resistance to believing that I have COVID.

**00:49:51** Everybody else is like, they turn their head in a certain way and like, Oh God, do I have COVID?

**00:49:58** You know, you're just like, I have all these symptoms. I'm sure it's just a cold. Yeah. It's

**00:50:04** like, I don't know what it is, but I clearly have some kind of mental block on this. And

**00:50:09** once again, like we got home and then my wife was like, Hey, you really need to take a COVID test.

**00:50:16** And I was shocked, right? I took the test. It was positive. I was like, I can't believe this.

**00:50:23** But yeah, so I got COVID again. And boy, I feel like I set some kind of record because I ended up

**00:50:32** testing positive at my wife's repeated insistence of like, I still need to take COVID tests.

**00:50:37** We went through this little pattern where I was like, I think I'm over it though. So I don't

**00:50:42** need, I think I'm fine. I don't need to take a test. And she would go, Oh, why don't you take

**00:50:46** a test? You know, just, just to confirm it. And I tested positive for two and a half weeks.

**00:50:52** So I had some people writing to tell me about this when I had COVID initially, because obviously I

**00:50:57** was away. So people were concerned about me getting home. It is normal enough that on antigen tests,

**00:51:04** people can test positive for weeks. Interesting. Even if they are no longer contagious.

**00:51:12** And that may be a PCR test would have reported slightly differently, maybe not. But some people

**00:51:18** will test positive for a really long time. Okay. I'm kind of relieved to hear that because everyone

**00:51:23** I was talking to was like, what the hell man? Like, you know, I've tested positive for

**00:51:26** Oh, it is weird. Like I it's weird. It's weird from my lived experience and from the people that

**00:51:31** I know that have had COVID, but I've heard from enough listeners during that time period that said

**00:51:38** that it is pretty frequent enough that people will test positive for a really long time.

**00:51:46** Okay. All right. That does make me feel better.

**00:51:48** Can we just take a quick pause? Cause I know some keen-eared listeners will have heard

**00:51:52** my whole family had COVID. We were very concerned about the lady gray and she seems to be the one

**00:51:59** who's been mostly fine for all of this. And I have been the one that has gotten hit harder. So

**00:52:05** that is 100% the way that I prefer it to be. I'm pretending in my mind, like, Oh, I've blocked the

**00:52:12** COVID for her. You took it all. You took a bullet.

**00:52:14** Yeah. Like I took it all, right? It's like it was a bear running at us and I got in the way

**00:52:20** and it hit me. Yes. And then I hit her, but that's obviously like less bad,

**00:52:27** even though she was the one who got it first. And we don't have to think about things like that.

**00:52:31** You said it laid reaction. It was shock from the attack, you know?

**00:52:36** Yeah. But yeah, so she's, you know, she didn't have like a fun time, but it was definitely not

**00:52:40** remotely as bad as a bunch of the other cases I've seen. So yeah. And she, she wasn't hit in

**00:52:45** the ways that were worrying, right? Initially. Yeah. Yeah. Which is good. Yeah. So it's, you know,

**00:52:50** we're very fortunate about that. Presumably it's the, whatever we're up to now, like B A

**00:52:57** Omicronicon. By the time this episode comes out, I'm sure it will have been, if not by now.

**00:53:01** Yeah. I got really annoyed because I was like, why are everyone calling these

**00:53:05** variants like B A whatever? And then I looked it up on Wikipedia and I said, oh, there's actually

**00:53:09** a sensible reason for this. I thought like, Oh, we just stopped using Greek letters for unknown

**00:53:14** reasons, but it's like, Oh no, these are like the 0.1 updates on here software.

**00:53:19** Bug fixes and performance improvements. Yeah. That's exactly what it is.

**00:53:23** Yeah. That's the release notes on each one of these 0.5 0.6 updates to COVID

**00:53:30** bug fixes and performance updates. It really is though. Yeah. That is functionally what it is.

**00:53:36** So yeah, like we've been talking about it for two and a half years at this point. The plan was always

**00:53:44** you're not going to avoid getting it, but we want to strategically get it at the best possible time.

**00:53:49** And it's like, okay, we've been through many variants as these things do, they tend to get,

**00:53:55** you know, more virulent, but less harmful over time. Like not always, but there are evolutionary

**00:54:00** pressures for why that's the case. And so I was like, okay, great. Like we put off for getting

**00:54:05** infected for a long time. Great. No problems. However, for me, it led to what I could only

**00:54:12** describe as one of the most frustrating months of my professional life.

**00:54:17** I am so happy we're in the same space right now. Yeah. Because like maybe the thing that I left

**00:54:24** out is like, I have also been very frustrated, which is what pushed me to think so heavily about

**00:54:28** a lot of this stuff that I've gone on in my life. I've been very annoyed, very angry, very upset

**00:54:33** about this and a bunch of other stuff going on. And it's just been this whole mess for me this

**00:54:38** last six, seven weeks. Because like, I think the thing about the COVID as it is right now,

**00:54:45** like I remember a few months ago, I knew people that had it. They're like, Oh, it's just like a

**00:54:49** bad cold. But I know for me and I know for you, it's been much worse than that. And so I don't

**00:54:55** know if maybe we just got hit harder or if like, this is more akin to what these newer variants

**00:55:02** are where like, they are maybe less deadly, but still can put you in a pretty bad way for a while.

**00:55:10** Yeah. Yeah. So it's like, I know I had all the kind of classic symptoms for a while,

**00:55:13** but what has been the particularly frustrating point, which both you who have checked in on me,

**00:55:19** the people I work with everyone in my life, I have constantly, I don't know, maybe every three days,

**00:55:25** given people an update of like, Hey, everything's on the up and up. Like I am on the upswing.

**00:55:32** Everything's great. This is all over only to come crashing down the next day and like starting all

**00:55:40** over again. Like I've never had anything like this. It's just so frustrating because I kept

**00:55:47** trying to have like a mental trend line for this is getting better or this is getting worse or even

**00:55:54** this is just staying the same. But no, just trying to think it's like, it's like, I don't know if you

**00:55:59** ever heard those audio illusions where it sounds like a tone is rising infinitely, but it actually

**00:56:05** isn't. I don't know if you ever come across this. Does that sound familiar to you? I think I know

**00:56:09** what you're talking about. Yeah. So like you can have these sounds that sound like the notes are

**00:56:13** going up forever, but obviously that's not possible. It's the audio equivalent of a, of

**00:56:19** an optical illusion. And I feel like I kind of had that experience a little bit of like, Oh, I must

**00:56:25** be getting better. But it's like, but no, you're not, you're not getting better. You're staying

**00:56:28** the same. It was super duper frustrating. And the thing on top of it that just killed me is it has

**00:56:37** been just a perfect storm of delaying putting out a video. And I have been like working on this

**00:56:45** video and it's like, okay, I wanted to try to get it done before traveling with my family, but that

**00:56:50** didn't quite work out. And so, okay. I was like, well, when I come back, I'm going to get this video

**00:56:55** done full steam ahead, full steam ahead. And I've been working on this. The video is 90% done. I just

**00:57:02** need to get it over that finishing line. I was like, man, in the past four or five weeks, it's

**00:57:08** like, okay, I've moved this video from 90% to 91% to 92%. It's been so slow and like every working

**00:57:20** day, okay, I'm really trying to work on this thing. I was just way less effective and then knocking

**00:57:26** myself out for a longer period of time. And I don't know, it is hard to express how awful it

**00:57:33** feels to not have uploaded something, to have something that feels so close to being finished

**00:57:42** and not be able to finish it in remotely the time that you want to while constantly feeling like,

**00:57:50** oh, I'm getting better now. And so now I'll be able to wrap this up in a few days, but you can't.

**00:57:57** It has just led to one of the most miserable months of my life professionally. It's just been awful.

**00:58:06** And it's partly why I was like, oh, Mike, we got to move this podcast recording back in the month

**00:58:11** as long as we can. And at the time of recording, it's like, oh man, I'm giving myself a 50-50 shot

**00:58:18** of actually having it up before this episode goes up. I've been waiting all day today for if you

**00:58:25** were going to send me a draft because when we record and you have a new video going up,

**00:58:35** usually if they're close, we end up recording slightly before and then we will hold the podcast

**00:58:41** and usually put it up after your video goes out. And I expected that that, but from the conversations

**00:58:46** we've had over the last few weeks, is that was most likely going to be what happened because I

**00:58:50** definitely got this vibe that you were like, come hell or high water. This video goes out. And so we

**00:58:56** decided we'd like delay. And I've been thinking today, I'm like, I wonder if he's going to send

**00:59:00** me a video cut. And the fact that you haven't does, has not made me feel great for you.

**00:59:08** Yeah. I sent you, I sent you a rough cut, like, I don't know, a week ago.

**00:59:11** Yeah. And you did something you don't usually do, which is don't listen to the audio. I was like,

**00:59:15** I just put the audio down on my iPhone and just like skimped through a little bit.

**00:59:19** Yeah. So part of the part of the process is this is not how anyone should make animated videos,

**00:59:25** but this is the way I like to do it is going back and forth between increasingly seeing what the

**00:59:31** animations are going to look like and then trying to tighten up the script to match the animations

**00:59:35** and then tightening the animations to match the script and like going back and forth a few times,

**00:59:40** which is not how anybody who does animation should ever do it because it takes a thousand

**00:59:44** times longer. The proper flow for almost every video you've ever seen on the internet or like

**00:59:49** movies you've seen is audio gets finalized and then video happens because it's like changing

**00:59:55** the audio is such a pain in the butt, but I don't like to do it that way for a bunch of reasons.

**00:59:59** So I had recorded a really rough track of the audio where I just talk through the script.

**01:00:05** I don't really try to do it properly. It's just, I want to give something to the animator so we can

**01:00:11** make something to see roughly how does this look with the words that I'm saying, but it's terrible.

**01:00:18** Like no one should watch it. So I had done this rough audio before I had left on the trip with

**01:00:26** my family and that's partly why I was like, Oh, I'm so confident about this because, you know,

**01:00:32** while I'm traveling, the animator can work on this and that can get done. And then when I can

**01:00:36** come back, I can just do all I need to do. Mike is make a couple of final tweaks to the scripts

**01:00:44** and then just record the final audio. And then it's all done. I mean, except for the 10,000 little

**01:00:51** picky changes I do after that, but like really it's basically done and there's no problem.

**01:00:56** But God damn, like the thing that has been killing me is I just, for a long time, I completely lost

**01:01:05** my voice and I've only really gotten it back in the last week. I went to record the audio

**01:01:14** and I just couldn't do it. Like it was unbelievable because here's the thing, like

**01:01:19** I feel like there's kind of three levels of talking. There's normal talking where I'm just

**01:01:23** at home and I say some things to my wife. There's a second level of talking, which is what we're

**01:01:28** doing right now on Cortex, which is there's a microphone in front of me. And so you talk more,

**01:01:37** you talk louder, right? Into the microphone. And the issue that I had and continue to have is

**01:01:45** it's more sustained talking for a longer period of time than a typical conversation would be.

**01:01:52** It's like just an intense conversation that you don't have very often in daily life.

**01:01:58** Yeah. Or I think it's more, it's more like phone calls as well. Like when you're doing

**01:02:03** like there's, there's a sustained thing there, which is why I always feel like conversations

**01:02:08** in real life, the key thing that's different about them is it's easier for both people to just not

**01:02:14** talk for a few moments and sit in silence with each other. And on phone calls and FaceTime,

**01:02:18** like you can't do that. And on podcasts, that's the whole thing.

**01:02:24** You know, you're like, oh, we'll just sit here for a couple of minutes and drink our coffee.

**01:02:28** And, you know, look off into space and then pick up the conference. Like you can't do that. So

**01:02:32** there's, there's this level, which is like a notch up from regular conversation, but then the videos

**01:02:38** are one notch above that because it's like giving a presentation. And I have a theory that you can

**01:02:44** maybe confirm for me about how you feel about this, the type of content that you make, you would

**01:02:50** prefer it not to be pinned in time forever. Like, yeah, that was the video Graham made when he had

**01:02:56** COVID and you can tell because you can hear it in his voice. I can imagine you would prefer the

**01:03:01** video not to sound like that. Yeah. I mean, I would prefer the video not to sound like that,

**01:03:05** but the problem I ran into the first day I went to record the final audio is I physically couldn't

**01:03:10** do it. I was absolutely shocked. And this again is like, we know we just, here's the theme. Gray

**01:03:16** is constantly surprised by COVID. What do you mean? I can't talk in this loud sustained way into a

**01:03:24** microphone. I do this all the time. Yeah. Like I physically can't do it. So yeah, I also kept

**01:03:28** giving up like, Oh, I'll have the audio any minute now. And it's like, no, I won't because I talk like

**01:03:33** this for 10 minutes and ended up just like uncontrollably coughing and like, okay, well,

**01:03:39** that's just, this is just not going to work. It's like, yeah, I don't want a video to have my voice

**01:03:45** sound like I am sick, but I couldn't even get to that stage. And so what I've ended up having to do,

**01:03:53** which I just, I loathe, I loathe so much is I had to break up recording the final audio

**01:04:01** into multiple sessions. Where I was like, okay, I'm going to just record as much as I can. And then

**01:04:07** I'm going to have to stop for today. And then that's it. And then pick this up tomorrow.

**01:04:12** Do you know what I did? Like I put a little marker on the floor for exactly where I was standing

**01:04:18** in front of the microphone. Because like to help minimize the different sound from the different

**01:04:25** days. But that's just one of the variables. There's a million variables distance from the

**01:04:30** microphone though is surprisingly important. And I think it is one of the things that is actually

**01:04:35** quite hard to fix in posts. Oh yeah. This is one of the things of like long-term projects. And one

**01:04:40** of the reasons why I would like an office is I would love to have a dedicated recording station

**01:04:46** just for the videos where nothing ever changes. I was like, I can stand in this exact spot. I never

**01:04:52** touch the microphone, never do anything to help minimize when this needs to happen. Yeah. But you

**01:04:58** know what you've eaten and had to drink that day. What time of the day is. Oh yeah. I know. I like.

**01:05:03** Sinuses going wild. Like as I know, I know, I know, I know, you know, but I just wanted to put it out

**01:05:10** there that this is about being able to control the things you can control. Yes. Yeah. Control

**01:05:16** the things you can control. You can also minimize a bunch of those variables by simply recording in

**01:05:22** the morning before you've eaten any, like there's a lot that you can do if you have to do this,

**01:05:26** but yeah. So the current state of my final audio is this horrific Frankenstein monster over many

**01:05:34** sessions where I put many takes together to try to get something that's a final audio. And I think

**01:05:40** you can hear in my voice that I'm sick. Like it's not terrible. I think a lot of people won't

**01:05:48** notice, but I can definitely hear. Most people aren't going to be able to tell about the variants

**01:05:55** of time. Yeah. Like this, I know we've mentioned this on the show before, but I know it's something

**01:06:00** that we can both notice. Maybe it's part of our jobs or maybe there's just some people more

**01:06:04** attuned to it than others when you can hear like what's called ADR or the TV show or movie. Oh,

**01:06:09** well, like somebody's added a line in that wasn't actually said at the time. Yeah. And it astounds

**01:06:15** me like I can spot it and I'll turn to Adina. Like, did you hear that? I have no idea what you're

**01:06:19** talking about. Yeah. But like, I don't know what it is. I think that maybe it's just something like

**01:06:23** if you're used to dealing with audio and like, like piecing together the way people speak,

**01:06:29** it truly is incredible how hard it is to try and make something match. It takes a lot of work to

**01:06:35** try and get that right. And a lot of skill in controlling your own voice is really hard. Yeah.

**01:06:42** It's, it's absolutely shocking. That is, uh, again, there are a thousand things where if you work in

**01:06:49** the world of entertainment or in the world of media, entertainment and media is completely

**01:06:54** ruined for you in a thousand tiny ways. And this is, and this is one of those ways of like,

**01:07:00** boy, you just always tune into it. Like, ah, they added that line of exposition later because

**01:07:05** they were afraid that people wouldn't understand what was going on. Like, yep, there we go. Hello,

**01:07:10** ADR. But yeah, so it was brutal. And that's how I've spent the last week is I was like, really just

**01:07:18** trying to kill myself to get this thing done. But I do these little recording sessions, strip my

**01:07:23** voice and then spend the rest of the day just like really exhausted and not being able to do very much.

**01:07:30** When you were saying earlier about the up and down you've had in symptoms, this is a part of that.

**01:07:37** And I'm not going to tell you that you should be resting because I didn't do it either. But like,

**01:07:42** that was the thing that I noticed. Like the harder I worked, the worse I felt the next day. Like,

**01:07:47** yeah, it would start to feel better. And then I would do something and it would pull me right

**01:07:50** back down again. Like this weekend, like Friday, I went to the gym for the first time. And I also

**01:07:59** saw some family over the weekend. And I've been struggling more the last two days than I was,

**01:08:05** say, Wednesday, Thursday of last week, because I've excited myself more. But the way that I don't

**01:08:11** know how you describe this kind of graph where like, but it's like a trend line. So like it goes up

**01:08:16** and down and up and down. But the valleys are always higher than before. And the peaks are

**01:08:21** higher than before. You know, do I explain in that right? Yeah, picture in your mind. But so like,

**01:08:27** I still have times where I feel worse than the day before, but even that worse is better than the

**01:08:32** worst of the previous week. Like that's kind of where I am. And I think you'll get there,

**01:08:37** but you've been putting yourself through one of the worst things you can do. Here's the thing,

**01:08:43** Mike, I'm going to say words, but I also know that I can't trust me saying these words of,

**01:08:48** oh, I think it's finally getting better. Right. But I've been saying that for weeks. Yeah,

**01:08:54** I really do. I can tell you, I really do think it's fine, but like, I don't actually know if

**01:08:58** that's true. And I just won't trust that that's true. Probably until I actually do the next

**01:09:03** recording and could be like, okay, it's fine. But we couldn't have done this two weeks ago.

**01:09:07** Yeah, that is true. I would simply, I would like not have been able to physically.

**01:09:10** But I would do it.

**01:09:12** So yeah, that definitely is better. But this is why I say like, yeah, in an ideal world,

**01:09:17** I would not try to push so hard to get the final audio done. But it is just that like,

**01:09:24** that unbelievable pressure of it's been forever since I've uploaded a video. Like,

**01:09:30** this has been, I think now the longest break ever on the channel since an upload. It has to be the

**01:09:35** case. And, you know, it's sort of like, you know, you were talking about the theme stuff as well and

**01:09:42** thinking about that. And so that's also partly why I was like, oh my God, I've had such a

**01:09:46** strange year kind of thinking about all of these things and related to the theme as well.

**01:09:52** But something I did maybe two weeks ago to kind of like, okay, I feel awful about this,

**01:10:01** but I can also rationally understand that it couldn't have been different. And the way I

**01:10:09** worked this out is like, okay, I went back and I counted from January, what was going on in every

**01:10:16** week of my life since January 1st until now. So I just updated the numbers until now. And it's like,

**01:10:24** okay, between traveling for my wife's family, for my family, for Hawaii jet lag, for also having

**01:10:36** COVID or being like now functionally in like a still a bad recovery from COVID. I actually have

**01:10:42** only had 10 clear weeks this whole year and we're halfway through the year. And six of those weeks

**01:10:52** were the first six weeks of the year making the highway video. And so it's like, okay,

**01:10:59** I can feel less bad about the situation when I look at it through that lens. I'm like, all right,

**01:11:08** you know, sort of related to what you were talking about. One of these fundamental ideas in life is

**01:11:15** that there's only four areas that you can spend your energy on. It's work, it's health, it's family,

**01:11:21** it's friends. And this has been one of those years where the intention was to spend a bunch

**01:11:29** of time with family, which was very important. And I was glad to do this, but what I was not

**01:11:35** expecting, and I feel like I've never really in this category thing, I've never really thought

**01:11:40** about the inverse of this. I've always thought of health in positive way of how much time do you want

**01:11:46** to spend being healthy? But there's also just the reverse. When your health is bad, that just takes

**01:11:54** away one, like that just uses up one of the categories. And you can't do anything about that.

**01:12:01** Like you don't get to choose as I did at the start of my career, like, oh, I'm just going to

**01:12:06** intentionally ignore my health. I was like, oh, if you're sick and not able to work, or you're just

**01:12:12** really slowed down, you don't get to make a choice about pushing through that. It's like, oh, okay,

**01:12:18** I just physically can't. So yeah, I've had six months where there's just two categories. It's

**01:12:26** been family and it's been health. And I've had 10 weeks where I was able to do work. And

**01:12:34** considering that it's like, okay, I'm actually not that far behind in terms of video production.

**01:12:41** It's just, I have to mentally calibrate for how much of the year was completely

**01:12:47** knocked out. So yeah, that's been my situation. It's been so frustrating. Like I can't,

**01:12:57** I feel like I can't even put it into words articulately. But yeah, I don't know if the

**01:13:02** video is going to be out before the podcast goes out. I really hope so.

**01:13:08** But we know it's close though. Like, you know it's close now.

**01:13:12** It is close. When you were asking about, oh, is Mike going to get a preview before the show?

**01:13:22** I also wasn't sure because it was just the day before yesterday that I put all the edits together

**01:13:29** and got it done. And so it is off with the animator and it is off with the composer and it is off with

**01:13:35** sound effects. Like all of that stuff is being worked on. And I just look now in my own company

**01:13:41** Slack of like, Ooh, did everything come through yet? And the answer is no, it hasn't come through

**01:13:44** yet. So, but the thing is, even if you had a rough cup for me, there's no point in me watching it.

**01:13:49** If we can't talk about it, we won't talk about it until we know it's going to be up. Right.

**01:13:55** Yeah. I guess that makes sense. Because I could just be like, Oh, it's really good. You should

**01:14:00** go watch it. But like, I could just say that anyway, Oh, the video is real good. Everyone

**01:14:03** should go watch it. You know what I mean? Like, there's there, we can't talk about it because

**01:14:08** it might not be out by now. And you don't want to do that. Cause yeah, bad enough that we're

**01:14:13** already saying there is one after six months of a gap. You know what I mean? Cause now it's like

**01:14:19** gray fans out there. They're like, Oh, all right, here we go. It's video time. Well, soon, but not

**01:14:25** yet. Maybe I don't know. I hope so. So here's, here's the problem is I haven't made a decision

**01:14:31** yet, but it's like, I might end up like, I don't know if I'm going to re re record the final audio.

**01:14:40** Like I've, I haven't really listened to it since I put it all together. And that was also a work

**01:14:46** day that almost killed me. Like I couldn't believe how tiring it was. If you have gotten it to a

**01:14:53** point where you're 70% happy, I would just say, go for it. Because if you do it again, you do the

**01:14:59** audio again and it knocks you out for another two days. Like, yeah, I dunno. You, you, you would

**01:15:07** just be doing this forever. Yeah, I don't know. The reason I'm just saying it's like up in the air at

**01:15:12** this moment is I haven't with a clean slate in my mind, listened to what I actually put together.

**01:15:21** So I feel like I actually don't have a good sense of what does the final audio sound like? Because

**01:15:29** putting it together was such an exhausting day that it's like, I didn't really have the ability

**01:15:35** to like evaluate it at the end. So that's why I'm like, I'll find out tomorrow, uh, because when

**01:15:42** we're done recording, I'm just going to collapse. And so hopefully tomorrow I have the first work in

**01:15:48** progress of a potentially releasable version of the video with the final audio and music and

**01:15:53** animations. And then I can try to make a judgment call about, okay, is this fine to go up or not?

**01:16:00** I really hope the answer is yes, because redoing the audio is just the absolute worst part of it.

**01:16:07** And I also not confident, like I'm physically up for it again, but we'll see. Yeah. This has been,

**01:16:16** this has been an absolute month of misery. That's what I've been up to, Mike.

**01:16:20** This is such an interesting point for us both to be in. I feel like this time of the year,

**01:16:27** yeah, for what was expected to be our half year. Let's talk about how our themes have gone so far.

**01:16:35** Yeah. And the answer for both of us is kind of like, not how we expected.

**01:16:41** Yeah, not, not how we expected. And also, I mean, for me, this is, is much more minor than it,

**01:16:46** than it was for you, but I have found myself thinking like, okay, so COVID isn't going

**01:16:53** anywhere. Like it's just going to be in the world. We're going to keep getting these different

**01:16:58** variants. And part of what I talked about at the start of the year was like, Ooh, I'm going to do

**01:17:02** all of this travel. And I'm, and like, I want to try to do more Grey goes outside stuff. And like,

**01:17:06** I have all of these ideas, all of which are involved in being outside of the house. But I do

**01:17:11** have to say it has been on the back of my mind this month of like, I know people who have gotten

**01:17:20** COVID many, many times now. And if this happens, like every time I catch it, I need to reevaluate

**01:17:29** some of my thoughts about travel. But that's the thing you just can't know.

**01:17:32** Oh yeah. Like I don't know. I don't know the answer to this. I have already kind of cut down

**01:17:38** some of my travel plans for the rest of the year, because I just need, like, I just need to

**01:17:43** reverse this and focus on work more for the rest of the year. But I do have two conferences that

**01:17:50** I've been invited to that I will not miss for anything. And I'm going to go to them, but they're

**01:17:55** going to be like a very interesting test case in if I go to conferences and because of travel and

**01:18:02** because of being in a room with a bunch of people who are talking about stuff. Like if I pick up

**01:18:07** COVID again from another one of those and it's like this, I don't know. Like I think I'm going

**01:18:14** to need to reevaluate some of my thoughts about, oh, how are the next many years going to go?

**01:18:19** Right now we'll see, but it has been just niggling at the back of my mind. You can't

**01:18:25** lose a couple of weeks frequently from getting sick from this. So I don't know.
