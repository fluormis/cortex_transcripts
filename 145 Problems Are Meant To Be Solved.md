# Cortex - 145: Problems Are Meant To Be Solved
**00:00:00** So, it's the year of work as part of the year of work.

**00:00:03** I want to take more work trips, more gray-cations.

**00:00:07** Ah, okay.

**00:00:08** Rent a hotel room, basically a self-created prison

**00:00:13** to just do a bunch of work.

**00:00:15** That's where I'm recording the show from right now.

**00:00:17** I'm once again at an undisclosed location in England

**00:00:21** in a hotel room.

**00:00:23** Is this like you've spoken to the god

**00:00:25** and this is your one call from the prison?

**00:00:27** I get my one phone call!

**00:00:30** And this is it.

**00:00:32** You can have your one phone call,

**00:00:33** but it also has to be work.

**00:00:35** And thus, we're talking.

**00:00:37** And that phone call will last six hours,

**00:00:38** but it is just one phone call.

**00:00:40** So, of course, finding the right kind of place, difficult.

**00:00:43** But found a hotel, came to hotel, come into the hotel room.

**00:00:49** And of course, the very first thing I do

**00:00:52** is I go to the air conditioning

**00:00:53** and I turn it all the way down to 16.

**00:00:56** And it let me.

**00:00:58** I thought, wow, this is great.

**00:01:01** Just what I wanted.

**00:01:02** Just what I hope for in the world.

**00:01:04** But as I'm unpacking, as I'm setting up, I feel like,

**00:01:08** boy, it just doesn't feel like it's actually getting cold.

**00:01:12** What's happening here?

**00:01:13** And I look back and the thermostat says 18.

**00:01:18** That's funny.

**00:01:19** I could have sworn that the thing that I always do,

**00:01:22** I did when I entered this room,

**00:01:23** which was turn it down to 16.

**00:01:25** So I go over there, boop, boop, boop, set it down to 16.

**00:01:29** Stays at 16.

**00:01:30** I walk away, do my stuff.

**00:01:33** But later in the evening, I again notice 18, not 16.

**00:01:38** So I thought, uh-oh.

**00:01:39** I go over, I press the little thermostat down, boop, boop, boop, 16.

**00:01:42** But this time, I stand there and I watch it.

**00:01:46** And I swear to God, for people just like me,

**00:01:49** this hotel put in some delay, which is,

**00:01:52** let them set the temperature to whatever they want.

**00:01:55** But wait 10 seconds and then bring it back up to 18

**00:02:00** and hope that they don't notice.

**00:02:03** So of course, where do I go immediately?

**00:02:06** 10 p.m. at night.

**00:02:08** I'm down at the front desk.

**00:02:10** Hey, let me put the air conditioning whichever way I want.

**00:02:12** What would you like to do in the room, sir?

**00:02:14** I would like to set the AC lower.

**00:02:16** Oh, you want the room colder?

**00:02:18** Yes, colder.

**00:02:19** Why would you like it colder?

**00:02:21** This is where it's like, I lose my mind.

**00:02:23** Right?

**00:02:23** I don't need to explain to you why.

**00:02:26** No, that's just too quick.

**00:02:26** They can tell you, no, sir, we can't do that.

**00:02:29** Right?

**00:02:29** And that's like whatever.

**00:02:31** These are the rules.

**00:02:32** This is the system.

**00:02:32** Whatever.

**00:02:33** There is absolutely zero point being like, why?

**00:02:37** You mean why?

**00:02:38** I'm not like running a science experiment

**00:02:39** that you're going to find out about.

**00:02:41** I just want it to be colder.

**00:02:43** You can do it or not.

**00:02:44** But the why is unimportant.

**00:02:46** I've got some cryogenically frozen

**00:02:48** dinosaur embryos in my suitcase.

**00:02:50** What do you mean why?

**00:02:52** I would like it colder.

**00:02:53** I'm in a hotel room that I'm paying for.

**00:02:55** That's funny.

**00:02:57** Can we do the thing?

**00:02:58** So we had to have this awkward conversation

**00:03:00** about why I would like it to be colder,

**00:03:03** which I'm trying to shortcut to, can you make it colder?

**00:03:06** Oh, John, sir.

**00:03:07** I'm intrigued.

**00:03:07** When they said, why do you want it to be colder?

**00:03:09** What did you say?

**00:03:10** Mike, this is not me at my best.

**00:03:13** I will fully admit, these are the kind of human interactions

**00:03:16** where I just, I do not perform the best.

**00:03:19** And I just repeat, because I would like it colder.

**00:03:24** And then they ask again.

**00:03:25** And then I say, because I'm uncomfortable.

**00:03:27** There must be something about like this interaction.

**00:03:29** I could always feel like, oh, this doesn't go well, right?

**00:03:31** I already know I'm in trouble.

**00:03:33** But like Jen, but this is why I asked,

**00:03:34** because I actually don't think that there is a good way

**00:03:36** for this conversation to go.

**00:03:38** Yeah, there's no good way for it to go.

**00:03:39** The question is pointless.

**00:03:40** The only answer is the one that it is,

**00:03:42** which is I want it to be colder.

**00:03:45** There doesn't have to be like a reason, you know?

**00:03:48** Yeah, and I also, I feel like,

**00:03:50** I think the reason it trips up my brain is,

**00:03:53** I feel like questions like that,

**00:03:54** which I do get sometimes when you're interacting

**00:03:56** with like customer service people in some ways,

**00:03:58** like I would like to do a thing.

**00:04:00** And frequently, I feel like they ask me why,

**00:04:02** because I'm wanting something that's just like slightly

**00:04:04** out of the ordinary.

**00:04:05** How many guests ever come down to the front,

**00:04:07** like hours after checking in to ask about the thermostat?

**00:04:10** I don't know, man.

**00:04:11** I expect every American that's ever gone to that hotel

**00:04:14** has come down to that hotel.

**00:04:15** That's my question.

**00:04:16** Honestly, like I don't think that this is that rare for them.

**00:04:21** You might be right.

**00:04:22** You might be right.

**00:04:23** But yeah, I feel like a why question,

**00:04:25** it's like an implicit invitation to lie, right?

**00:04:29** Because the sort of implication is,

**00:04:31** if you have a good enough answer, this will be granted.

**00:04:35** I feel like that's kind of the implication

**00:04:37** behind a why question.

**00:04:39** So anyway, we stumble around with a why question.

**00:04:41** Again, in my whole life, all I wish to be is not noticed,

**00:04:45** but now we're having the manager come down to the front desk

**00:04:48** because I've like thrown off the person who's actually

**00:04:51** at the front desk and the manager is like,

**00:04:53** we went through the whole rigmarole again.

**00:04:55** She asks, what would you like to do?

**00:04:57** Why would you like to do this?

**00:04:59** I find the room physically uncomfortable

**00:05:00** at the temperature.

**00:05:01** Like I can see that the thermostat will go down to 16,

**00:05:04** but then it bumps it back up to 18.

**00:05:05** Can I get this changed?

**00:05:07** So the strategy now from the hotel's perspective was delay.

**00:05:10** So they tell me, oh, we need the maintenance department

**00:05:14** in order to do that.

**00:05:15** But we have no maintenance department on the weekends.

**00:05:19** And I'm just like narrowing my eyes,

**00:05:22** looking at the badger stuff, thinking,

**00:05:23** What do they do if something breaks on a Sunday?

**00:05:25** Exactly.

**00:05:26** I am in a hotel.

**00:05:26** There are hundreds of rooms in this hotel.

**00:05:29** There is no universe where you don't have a maintenance department

**00:05:33** on the weekends when you have hundreds of hotel rooms.

**00:05:37** It's just not possible.

**00:05:38** So they delay delight and they're like, well, sir,

**00:05:40** I checked in on a Saturday.

**00:05:42** Well, sir, we'll have to get the maintenance department in

**00:05:44** on the weekday, right, when the Monday starts.

**00:05:47** And then, of course, when I follow this up, the end result is,

**00:05:50** no, I'm afraid we just can't do anything

**00:05:53** about the air conditioning.

**00:05:54** It's centrally set.

**00:05:56** I was waiting for that.

**00:05:56** God damn.

**00:05:58** Yeah, exactly.

**00:05:59** So many times I've heard you hear things like that, right?

**00:06:01** Oh, centrally set.

**00:06:03** Oh, central's doing it.

**00:06:05** Oh, okay.

**00:06:05** Central's doing it, right?

**00:06:07** Yes, exactly.

**00:06:08** So it's like this is my life now, right?

**00:06:12** I'm thinking, again, ideally, I would like to do at least one

**00:06:17** or maybe two more little short, intense working trips

**00:06:20** before the year is over to just try to like knock out

**00:06:22** a bunch of stuff that I want to do for a year of work.

**00:06:25** But I'm just thinking, great.

**00:06:26** Now this is another thing that I need to add on to my checklist.

**00:06:29** It's like, does the hotel have air conditioning?

**00:06:32** Yes, which is hard enough to find in England.

**00:06:34** But then what?

**00:06:35** I need to call and ask them, tell me what your air conditioning

**00:06:39** is really set at.

**00:06:41** I know you have it, but I also know now this is just a thing

**00:06:44** that's going to be spreading everywhere.

**00:06:45** You're all centrally setting the air conditioning

**00:06:48** at whatever you want to set it at.

**00:06:50** And I am but a humble pawn in this system

**00:06:53** and I can't do anything to try to improve my situation.

**00:06:56** So I'm going to, if you will allow me,

**00:06:58** I want to roleplay this conversation when you call.

**00:07:01** Oh, no.

**00:07:02** Okay.

**00:07:02** So like you've called and I'm like, hello, this is the hotel.

**00:07:05** How can I help you?

**00:07:07** Oh, oh.

**00:07:08** Okay.

**00:07:09** Well, I don't want to be on this call in the first place.

**00:07:10** You're on it now.

**00:07:11** Oh, no.

**00:07:12** Okay.

**00:07:13** Hi.

**00:07:14** I'm thinking of booking a room in your hotel,

**00:07:16** but I need to know what you actually set the minimum air conditioning to.

**00:07:21** Why?

**00:07:24** You really think that this is a question that anyone's going to answer

**00:07:28** in a way that you find satisfying?

**00:07:30** They'll tell you either whatever you want to hear,

**00:07:32** or they'll just say, why?

**00:07:34** I know.

**00:07:35** This is the thing.

**00:07:36** I know that this is one of these things where,

**00:07:39** from the hotel's perspective,

**00:07:40** they just want me to book the room, right?

**00:07:42** And then later, it'll be like, oh, well, we didn't have that policy

**00:07:46** in place when you booked, but between then and your arrival,

**00:07:49** like this new system rolled out.

**00:07:50** So here's my thought on the future because I was like, all right.

**00:07:53** Well, this is just going to be a problem in my life,

**00:07:56** but problems are meant to be solved.

**00:07:59** I went on YouTube and I tried to find like some thermostats will have a secret

**00:08:02** like bypass mode if you press the right set of buttons.

**00:08:04** This one didn't have a secret bypass mode,

**00:08:07** but in the process of doing that, it occurred to me,

**00:08:09** I was realizing, oh, HVAC systems are actually very electrically simple.

**00:08:14** Like I know behind this panel, there's really only three wires,

**00:08:19** only one of which is powered, and one of them just needs to get

**00:08:23** the correct signal to turn the AC on.

**00:08:25** So I've just been trying to think and trying to strategize

**00:08:29** about what can I do in the future?

**00:08:31** And I guess my plan is going to be if I've booked a hotel room,

**00:08:36** see if I can find the exact model of thermostat

**00:08:39** that they're using on one of the product photos of the room

**00:08:42** and just order one of those to bring with me

**00:08:46** with a small electrical kit to just replace it on the wall.

**00:08:50** I think this is going to be my plan going forward.

**00:08:52** I think this is a step too far.

**00:08:54** Actually, I think it's more than one step too far, I think.

**00:08:58** What's too far about this?

**00:08:59** Fiddling with the electronics and like, I just think that's too far.

**00:09:03** Also, I bet it won't get you what you want anyway.

**00:09:06** What do you perceive is going to be the roadblock for this plan?

**00:09:08** I mean, I don't know enough about how HVAC systems work, right?

**00:09:12** But I don't think that the actual thermostat on the wall is the problem

**00:09:17** because you're telling that thermostat what you want, right?

**00:09:19** Yeah. So I went to the company that manufactures the thermostat in my room

**00:09:24** and went through all of their technical details and discovered,

**00:09:28** much to my delight, that...

**00:09:29** You're supposed to be working. What are you doing?

**00:09:32** Well, no, I'm trying to work, right?

**00:09:34** Yeah, but you can work in 18 degrees.

**00:09:35** The hotel is like getting in my way.

**00:09:37** It's not that hot. 18 degrees is like, I will say like 16 is freezing.

**00:09:44** I don't know why you want to sit in that temperature anyway.

**00:09:47** 18 is like in a room that's cold.

**00:09:50** I'm literally sweating right now is where I have this conversation.

**00:09:52** Well, because you're getting worked up.

**00:09:53** I can mop the sweat off of my brow in this 18 degree room.

**00:09:58** Then look, let me tell you, right?

**00:10:00** If that's the thing, your problem is not the air conditioning.

**00:10:02** You need to see a doctor.

**00:10:04** I think it's like the actual situation.

**00:10:06** You shouldn't be that hot.

**00:10:07** How many clothes are you wearing?

**00:10:09** What are you doing?

**00:10:11** Just here in a t-shirt.

**00:10:13** But okay, so listen, the important thing is HVAC systems in the hotel rooms,

**00:10:17** even according to a company that is very clearly marketing this to hotels as,

**00:10:23** hey, we will save you a bunch of money by mildly inconveniencing all of your guests.

**00:10:28** Like that is totally the pitch, right?

**00:10:30** From the HVAC company.

**00:10:32** But each of the systems is electrically isolated in the room.

**00:10:36** The thermostats are on the wifi network.

**00:10:39** That's where they're receiving instructions from.

**00:10:41** It's like, ah, okay.

**00:10:43** So they're connecting to like the hotel wifi to get the instructions of like,

**00:10:48** we're not allowed to turn it down below here.

**00:10:50** And ultimately this is just a little machine that is applying or not applying

**00:10:54** voltage to these three wires on the back.

**00:10:57** So I don't think there's any kind of direct communication between the actual

**00:11:01** AC and heating system and the rest of the hotel.

**00:11:04** I think it's purely for that little panel that's sitting on front.

**00:11:08** So anyway, this is what was going through my mind,

**00:11:11** but I have gotten the temperature just a little below 18 to when I'm not

**00:11:17** editing on a podcast, acceptable temperatures, because there's a very strange layout in this

**00:11:22** room, which is that the TV is basically right next to the thermostat.

**00:11:27** And the other thing I wanted to know is where is the heat sensor in the thermostat?

**00:11:33** So if I turn on the TV and put a big towel over the TV, the TV gets very warm and it's clearly

**00:11:44** tricked the thermostat into thinking the room is like half a degree warmer than it really is for

**00:11:50** the air temperature.

**00:11:51** And when the TV eventually sets fire to the towel, the room will get even colder.

**00:11:55** So that would be good for you.

**00:11:57** See my feeling here, like this thing that you've mentioned,

**00:11:59** this is exactly the reason they should just let me set the temperature

**00:12:02** to where I want it to be.

**00:12:04** No, you cannot draw the line between these.

**00:12:07** You should because otherwise I'll have to set the room on fire.

**00:12:10** This is not a logical cause and effect of why they should make the room colder

**00:12:14** because otherwise the guests will catch fire to things.

**00:12:19** Look, you don't want people monkeying around with your electrics.

**00:12:22** So don't force them to.

**00:12:24** We cannot draw the conclusion here, because this isn't a natural evolution of this problem.

**00:12:31** But it is a very natural evolution of this problem.

**00:12:33** I have a problem.

**00:12:34** What are my tools to solve the problem?

**00:12:36** Like that's of course, it's going to go this way.

**00:12:38** But most people will have stopped at bring my own thermostat.

**00:12:44** There are many steps between like.

**00:12:51** Yeah, there are many steps that people would naturally end before.

**00:12:55** I will research the thermostat by a thermostat, wait for the thermostat to be delivered,

**00:13:01** bring it and a screwdriver to the hotel.

**00:13:04** Most people will have stopped before them.

**00:13:06** I mean, what most people do is not my problem.

**00:13:08** I'm just talking about what I'm doing and why the hotel should let me do what I want to do.

**00:13:11** I don't want to bring a thermostat to the room either.

**00:13:14** Like I don't want to be monkeying around with the electrics.

**00:13:16** I was also trying to think like, could I rig up or maybe Cortex brand could sell some kind of product

**00:13:22** where it's like you can attach something to the thermostat and put a hot water bottle in it or

**00:13:27** something to like again, trick the thermostat into thinking what is the actual temperature

**00:13:31** of the room so that it will drop the temperature.

**00:13:34** Maybe there are like less invasive ways to do that.

**00:13:36** I don't want to be any more involved in this situation than I already currently am.

**00:13:41** So no, I'm going to veto the Cortex brand thermostat tricking water bottle from existing.

**00:13:48** I don't know, Mike, I think there could be a really big market.

**00:13:50** Only, only, no, no.

**00:16:21** So I took my assignment after our last episode,

**00:16:24** which was to install iOS 17 and try out the mood tracking.

**00:16:28** Yes, yes, I forgot about that.

**00:16:30** Right, right.

**00:16:30** And so in between us recording and publishing the show, I installed iOS 17 on my phone.

**00:16:37** And I would say that like overall the beta has been mostly okay.

**00:16:40** It's as good or bad as any other beta, but I really wanted to try out the mood tracking.

**00:16:46** And I would say that like overall it's doing what I expected in the way that I expect it,

**00:16:52** but I think it has for me, I think one key problem.

**00:16:56** So this system will allow you to multiple times a day, either whenever you decide,

**00:17:03** or if you set up the system to prompt you via notifications to tell it how you are feeling.

**00:17:08** It's all contained within the health app, which if you want to go in manually and add it to yourself,

**00:17:13** suffers the exact same problem that everything else in the health app does,

**00:17:16** which is just it's just not very well laid out.

**00:17:19** It's like just in this like list of cards.

**00:17:21** I would honestly prefer Apple to have distinct apps for all of these things,

**00:17:27** like the medicine tracking and you know, which they do on the Apple watch, but not on the phone.

**00:17:31** I would just prefer they broke all these out into their own separate things.

**00:17:34** So it would be easier to get to them.

**00:17:36** But you will go in and you press the log button and it asks you,

**00:17:40** how are you, you can log how you're feeling right now or how you felt overall in the day.

**00:17:44** And the first thing that it takes you to is like this really pretty animation.

**00:17:47** And you can on a scale from very unpleasant to very pleasant,

**00:17:50** you like drag the slider to say how you're feeling.

**00:17:53** And my favorite thing about all of it is the colors and the animations

**00:17:57** and the shapes that the system shows you.

**00:18:00** I just think this is a really nice and soft way to help somebody maybe kind of get across

**00:18:05** what they're trying to get across of how they're feeling.

**00:18:08** Yeah, I just think that it looks really good.

**00:18:10** And I think people could maybe attach to certain shapes and colors.

**00:18:14** I have no doubt that there is some really good science in this,

**00:18:17** you know, is more than for me to understand, right?

**00:18:20** Like why you would do it this way.

**00:18:21** Also, Apple has finally validated my purple is clearly the worst color feeling

**00:18:26** because very unpleasant is purple.

**00:18:29** Like kind of kind of a salmon, the orange is like very pleasant with green and blue in the middle.

**00:18:34** So everything's kind of like stars and flowers, right?

**00:18:38** It's like what they're going for.

**00:18:39** It's all really interesting design wise.

**00:18:41** You go in and you state how you're feeling.

**00:18:44** The next question you're given is what best describes this feeling.

**00:18:48** And it gives you a bunch of words that you can just tap the word,

**00:18:51** which is the most applicable.

**00:18:53** And these words differ depending on how pleasant and unpleasant you're saying you're feeling.

**00:18:58** But you can tap a button that says show more and it gives you the full list of all of them.

**00:19:03** So like, for example, if you are feeling very pleasant, but for some reason want to say annoyed,

**00:19:08** you can say that by tapping into the show more.

**00:19:12** Right?

**00:19:12** Like, I don't know why you would necessarily match that up, but you can.

**00:19:15** My main issue with the app is what happens after you press this button.

**00:19:19** So it says what best describes this thing you choose, then you press next.

**00:19:23** And it says what's having the biggest impact on you.

**00:19:27** And you were given a list of things that set up into like three groups.

**00:19:32** But in my opinion, there is just not enough descriptors here.

**00:19:37** So like, I'll give you a good example, right?

**00:19:39** One day I was like, not feeling too great about something we had going on in the house

**00:19:43** with some renovations that we have going on.

**00:19:46** So I said that I was feeling very unpleasant.

**00:19:49** And, you know, it's like what best describes this feeling?

**00:19:52** And I was like, disappointed, stressed, worried, right?

**00:19:56** Press next.

**00:19:57** And there is nothing in here for what is having the biggest impact on you

**00:20:03** that is relatable to what I'm feeling.

**00:20:06** There is nothing about home here, for example.

**00:20:11** Right?

**00:20:11** So like I could have said health, fitness, self-care, hobbies, identity, spirituality,

**00:20:16** community, family, friends, partner, dating, tasks, work, education,

**00:20:20** travel, weather, current events, money.

**00:20:21** They are the same always.

**00:20:23** Now, if you tap one of these, it gives you the ability to add additional context.

**00:20:29** And so you could write down what you're feeling.

**00:20:31** But there were multiple times where I felt like I couldn't express what I wanted

**00:20:37** because this biggest impact field just didn't have something that was relating

**00:20:42** to what was making me feel a certain way.

**00:20:44** And what I don't understand is why they have so many options for the description words,

**00:20:51** but so few options for the impact words.

**00:20:56** I think it will turn people off because I think people are pretty vulnerable

**00:21:00** a lot of the time when they're entering something like this.

**00:21:03** And if you're feeling a certain feeling, you're looking for validation

**00:21:08** that what you're feeling is real.

**00:21:11** And if you come to this screen and you can't find it,

**00:21:14** like it almost makes me feel like a little bit like,

**00:21:17** oh, worrying about your home is not something to worry about.

**00:21:23** I don't mean to laugh, but I'm just realizing,

**00:21:25** I feel like the phone isn't validating that feeling.

**00:21:28** Is that is that the way you would want to express that?

**00:21:30** Yeah.

**00:21:31** It's like, you know, you could go to here and you go to very unpleasant

**00:21:34** and you're looking for air conditioning thermostat, but it's just not there.

**00:21:38** It isn't there.

**00:21:38** Yeah.

**00:21:38** I'm feeling very unpleasant about this.

**00:21:40** You're feeling very unpleasant right now because your co-host,

**00:21:42** I won't agree that you should be able to take electric screwdriver to a hotel room.

**00:21:46** No, he won't help me make the product with a hot water bottle.

**00:21:49** Okay.

**00:21:50** Same thing.

**00:21:51** I still have agency with the screwdriver, Mike.

**00:21:53** I find this to just be like an odd omission, like, or even the additional context

**00:21:59** or allowing you to type in whatever you want.

**00:22:02** That should just be there always, right?

**00:22:04** Rather than it necessarily being the buttons.

**00:22:06** They are restricting me to choosing.

**00:22:09** And some of the time, the feelings that I was having,

**00:22:12** I couldn't express with the choice that they were making me make.

**00:22:16** And so I found that to be weird.

**00:22:19** So you felt boxed in by the end result of like, what is the root cause of this thing?

**00:22:24** Yeah.

**00:22:24** I had to say like, oh, money, but it wasn't a money problem.

**00:22:29** That's not the problem that it was.

**00:22:30** It was just something that was frustrating to me that was going to take more time for

**00:22:34** something to be done.

**00:22:36** But there wasn't anything that I could tap inside of this screen

**00:22:41** that I felt could accurately like get across what I was frustrated about.

**00:22:45** So in its current state, how useful do you think this is for you?

**00:22:52** I mean, for me not, but I wasn't looking for this at the moment.

**00:22:55** I don't really feel like I need an app like this.

**00:22:58** But if I was in a time when I feel like I did, or if I take myself back to the time

**00:23:04** when I was using mood path, this would be very useful for me.

**00:23:07** It is not perfect, but I feel like it would at least give me a low friction way to be able to

**00:23:14** think a little bit more deeply about what's making me upset or how I'm feeling in any moment,

**00:23:21** whether it's good or bad or otherwise.

**00:23:23** And the simplicity and visual nature of it are fantastic.

**00:23:26** Like this is the kind of thing that Apple is good for, right?

**00:23:28** It's like boiling things down to their simplest form and giving you an entry path

**00:23:34** into this kind of idea.

**00:23:35** And I think that this app does that.

**00:23:37** So where like, for example, I might start using this and start logging and then be like,

**00:23:43** oh, I can't actually find all of the things I want.

**00:23:46** Is there anything else out there that is more advanced?

**00:23:51** And then I could start my way into finding a different mood tracking app.

**00:23:54** But I just feel like there is for me just this one thing that if they change,

**00:23:59** what I would like is for there to be more options.

**00:24:02** But in lieu of more options, just allowing me to by default type whatever I want into a text field,

**00:24:08** which is a thing they do offer.

**00:24:10** But only when you tap a button to then add more context.

**00:24:14** If there was just an empty text field there where I could just type whatever I wanted,

**00:24:18** this thing would be ideal, I think.

**00:24:20** In its current state, I think this is a good first attempt and baking it into the system,

**00:24:25** having notifications that can grab me during the day, like by and large,

**00:24:28** a lot of the basics are there.

**00:24:30** But I think it's just missing that one little thing.

**00:24:33** It's interesting to hear those thoughts.

**00:24:36** Last time we had a conversation about this mood tracker,

**00:24:39** which I didn't like.

**00:24:41** And then you sort of talked me around last show of like,

**00:24:44** oh, how would you use this?

**00:24:45** And I said, oh, Mike, you know, Mike's making some interesting points.

**00:24:48** When I go to edit the show and I'm re-listening to the conversation,

**00:24:52** I got mad all over again.

**00:24:53** And I was having that experience of past gray.

**00:24:57** Why are you letting Mike talk you into this?

**00:24:59** Like, it was just it's a very funny thing to be in that disagreement with yourself

**00:25:05** on such a short period of time.

**00:25:07** And I don't know.

**00:25:11** I'm trying to articulate like what is going on in my mind about this app

**00:25:14** because it really is sticking something with me.

**00:25:17** And I think what I'm trying to like narrow down here is we also brush up against this

**00:25:23** when we talk about the theme system journal of you use it in a different way than I do.

**00:25:29** I focus on the gratitude stuff and you will often mention like writing down

**00:25:36** things that aren't going well or things that are bothering you.

**00:25:39** And it always kind of like sticks in my brain of like, I don't like that,

**00:25:43** but that totally works for you.

**00:25:45** Like the point of the whole product is like that works for you.

**00:25:48** That's great.

**00:25:49** So what is my problem with this app is I feel like there's just a big difference between

**00:25:55** someone like you, like a smart, self-aware person who thinks about this stuff a bunch,

**00:26:01** who's like part of your job is to literally think about this stuff.

**00:26:04** And intentionally choosing a tool and using it in a way that it works well for you.

**00:26:09** And I guess on the flip side of that, I look like at this app and it's a bit like

**00:26:14** an epidemiological problem.

**00:26:16** Like you're going to just suddenly roll out to millions of people, a mood tracker.

**00:26:23** And so even if there are people this could work for, I'm concerned that like on average,

**00:26:30** I think the way this thing is set up is bad for people.

**00:26:34** And trying to articulate it, it's like I've always kind of had this rule for the internet,

**00:26:41** which is what you pay attention to, you grow.

**00:26:46** And so everyone knows this experience with the algorithms, right?

**00:26:49** Like you click on a couple of news things and then guess what?

**00:26:52** You've just grown in your world.

**00:26:54** You've grown the presence of news, right?

**00:26:57** You start watching some beekeeping videos.

**00:26:59** And guess what?

**00:26:59** Suddenly like it's all beekeeping videos.

**00:27:01** Like this way, like what you pay attention to is what you grow.

**00:27:06** And everyone can see that really directly with the algorithm.

**00:27:10** But I think it's also just true in your life.

**00:27:12** Like what you pay attention to is what you grow.

**00:27:17** The more you pay attention to a thing, whatever it is in your life,

**00:27:20** the more you become the kind of person who pays attention to that thing.

**00:27:26** And I just really worry about the negative side of this app,

**00:27:33** precisely because it just says, how are you feeling right now?

**00:27:37** And I really don't like this workflow of like, I'm feeling very unpleasant.

**00:27:41** And then you say that angry and anxious.

**00:27:43** And then you say next, what are you angry and anxious about?

**00:27:47** And then you have to pick the things.

**00:27:48** Oh, my family and my friends, right?

**00:27:50** And you select those two boxes.

**00:27:53** I mean, I don't know.

**00:27:54** Maybe people are just much more internally unaware of their own feelings than I estimate they are.

**00:28:02** But I just feel like focusing in that way, you're growing your own attention to that thing.

**00:28:11** And I just worry about like, it could start like tiny reinforcement loops in people's heads,

**00:28:18** particularly around the social stuff.

**00:28:20** I just find quite concerning of like, yeah,

**00:28:24** family and friends and coworkers could just be annoying in life.

**00:28:28** And I just I think like rolling this out to millions of people, I think they're like,

**00:28:32** lots of times people are going to do that thing where it's like, oh, they pick.

**00:28:36** I'm feeling annoyed at this person.

**00:28:39** And you've just kind of like grown that thought a little stronger in your own mind.

**00:28:44** Like you grow what you pay attention to.

**00:28:47** And it's again, this could also just entirely be because of my experience with how frustratingly

**00:28:53** effective gratitude journaling is that just like just paying attention to something like

**00:29:00** this cup of coffee smells nice, like just grows appreciation very clearly and very strongly.

**00:29:07** So I think maybe I'm overtuned to worry about the opposite, but I still feel like

**00:29:14** I've been playing around with this app and I've been just trying to see what it is and trying to

**00:29:18** articulate my thoughts.

**00:29:19** And it's like every time I interact with it, I hate it more.

**00:29:23** And I worry more about it just again, not for any individual person, but Apple just works on

**00:29:31** such a scale.

**00:29:32** I think it's like a slight nudge for the whole population in an averagely bad direction.

**00:29:40** And I think the other part of that as well, which is just concerning to me is also like with so

**00:29:48** much of the health app that I also have increasingly large number of things to complain about.

**00:29:53** Where does this translate into action is my other concern.

**00:29:58** Like simply logging is not action.

**00:30:02** Well, they did say, I mean, and I don't know, but they did say that they would point people

**00:30:06** towards questionnaires and resources.

**00:30:09** I think probably if you're consistently saying you're feeling bad in some way or another would

**00:30:14** be my assumption.

**00:30:15** Yeah, but I fully expect it.

**00:30:18** You see TV shows do this as well.

**00:30:20** It's I feel like it's a kind of contact to such and such person.

**00:30:24** It just it feels like covering themselves.

**00:30:27** And also the thing with with the mood tracking is that's too far of a step, right?

**00:30:34** If your app says you need to go to therapy for most people, that's like a really far step to do,

**00:30:42** especially just on their own because their phone is telling them.

**00:30:45** And like I was looking at some of the other mood trackers.

**00:30:48** I was looking at daily.

**00:30:49** Oh, so I have a friend who uses daily.

**00:30:51** Oh, and was really liking it.

**00:30:52** I was just kind of because of this topic, I was asking like, what do you like about this?

**00:30:55** Or what does it do this different?

**00:30:57** And again, maybe it's because it's not Apple.

**00:30:59** Maybe it's because it's a smaller company and they're less concerned about all of the implications

**00:31:03** of this stuff.

**00:31:04** But they do the thing that I wish Apple would do, which is like straight up give you a correlation

**00:31:09** between these two things.

**00:31:11** Your mood is heavily impacted by did you go outside today?

**00:31:16** But I just worry that for people, it's going to be a place to merely reinforce negative

**00:31:24** thoughts without clear, but also small tractable actions to take.

**00:31:31** Like going outside makes a big difference or like all of the things that your phone knows

**00:31:37** about you.

**00:31:38** I feel like it could just make little nudges in those directions, but it just seems like Apple

**00:31:42** is like never going to do that.

**00:31:45** They're just never showing you a graph that correlates one thing with another.

**00:31:49** So in summary, I just really don't like this thing.

**00:31:53** Now that we're recording the show, I'm going to turn it off and try not to think about it.

**00:31:58** But it is just silently in the back of my mind, partly because we do have that theme

**00:32:04** system journal and we've talked about this kind of self-improvement stuff.

**00:32:08** I just I care a lot about people living good and happy lives.

**00:32:17** It's not a thing that we talk about a ton directly, but it is something that comes up

**00:32:22** on the show.

**00:32:22** It's like, how do you make yourself better?

**00:32:25** How do you improve?

**00:32:26** How can you just be happier with your life?

**00:32:30** It matters a lot to me that the audience can move in a right direction.

**00:32:37** And those are always the best messages to get from people is like impacts that you've had

**00:32:42** on people in a positive direction.

**00:32:44** So I care a lot about this stuff and I just I just really worry about this one.

**00:32:51** So I have two things.

**00:32:54** Okay.

**00:32:54** Leave.

**00:32:54** Talk me out of this, please.

**00:32:56** I'm not going to talk you out of it because I don't think I can.

**00:32:58** But in the state of mind area of the health app, which is where you access the mood tracking,

**00:33:05** there is a button that says show in charts.

**00:33:08** And when you press on that, you get a couple of things you get over the week,

**00:33:13** month, six months or years, you can choose to look at all of the events that you've logged.

**00:33:17** And you can see the breakdown of your daily moods and your momentary emotions.

**00:33:21** They then have a button called associations where you can then see like what you thought

**00:33:26** about each of the categories, meaning like partner, money, friends, all of those things

**00:33:30** I was talking about earlier on.

**00:33:32** There's another button called life factors where it shows you on a couple of charts.

**00:33:37** You're very pleasant to very unpleasant tracked entries as little dots.

**00:33:42** And then you have a chart underneath and it will let you compare your emotional state to

**00:33:48** exercise, mindful minutes, the amount of sleep that you've got and the time you've had in daylight.

**00:33:53** Okay.

**00:33:53** That is good.

**00:33:54** Yeah, that is not doing nothing.

**00:33:56** Like it is doing some layering of information that you've provided

**00:34:01** with other stuff that the health app can know about you.

**00:34:05** I think the reason why I was just kind of blowing past this is because

**00:34:08** as you were describing it, I'm looking at it on my phone, I'm going like, where is this?

**00:34:11** And I'm like, Oh, of course it's directly above where I go to log the thing.

**00:34:16** It shows time and daylight, exercise minutes and sleep.

**00:34:20** Last night's sleep was particularly brutal.

**00:34:22** So maybe that's why I'm feeling very grumpy right now.

**00:34:24** I know that it layers, but I still think there's something different between layering,

**00:34:29** like you draw the conclusion and them drawing the conclusion and saying, we know this.

**00:34:36** Well, this is something that we want from them in a bunch of areas, right?

**00:34:39** As we said before, this idea of your heart rate changed.

**00:34:45** Okay. Is this good or bad? Can you let me know?

**00:34:50** But so that's one point, but I wanted to just state that it does do,

**00:34:53** I think more than a lot of areas of the health app of actually taking two pieces of information

**00:34:57** and putting them on a chart together. So I actually think it is better than other areas.

**00:35:01** I will agree. I will concede that point.

**00:35:03** The other one is I just want to state, look, what the way you've explained about how this

**00:35:06** makes you feel, I understand it and it makes sense to me, but it is not how I feel. Right?

**00:35:13** Right.

**00:35:13** And so like, I just want to like put that out there of like, just, you know, and I'm sure you're

**00:35:18** aware of this, but just to like state this clearly on the show of like, walk me through it again,

**00:35:23** please do this kind of thing helps me because sometimes all I know is I'm feeling something,

**00:35:30** but I don't know what it is, but I have a feeling like this morning I woke up and I was feeling

**00:35:37** very anxious and worried and I had to sit and because I've gotten better at this of like taking

**00:35:44** a check for myself of like, why am I feeling this way? Like, what is the thing? And then I could end

**00:35:51** up thinking about it. I worked out what it was. Then I made a note because I needed to talk to

**00:35:57** you about it. And so I spoke to you about it and now I feel better, but it was, it's only because

**00:36:02** I have gotten better because of the work that I've done with mood tracking and with therapy and stuff

**00:36:07** like that, of like being able to label my feelings because I very frequently have feelings more than

**00:36:15** I know what they are or like where they're coming from. And so an app like this, it forces me to

**00:36:22** reflect and that is helpful. Now I understand what you're saying about like reflecting on negative

**00:36:27** things could make you feel worse, but the negative things are still happening anyway. So there can

**00:36:34** be a value. I think of like, say negative about friends and it's forcing me to say, I'm feeling

**00:36:39** bad about my friends. When I do stuff like that sometimes I'm like, yeah, but they're not so bad.

**00:36:44** Like they're annoying me today, but tomorrow, you know, like it makes me like assess a little bit

**00:36:51** more deeply, like why I'm feeling a certain way because I get like that this morning. I was in a

**00:36:56** group chat and someone frustrated me in the group chat and I was annoyed about it. And then later on,

**00:37:01** it's like, no, you know what? Like they're just living their life. They're doing their thing.

**00:37:06** It's not against me, but it affects me. Sure. But it's not, they're not doing it to affect me. I'm

**00:37:13** just like collateral damage in the decision that they've made. They don't even know it's going to

**00:37:17** affect me, but it does. And so like, these are the kinds of things that like being able to reflect

**00:37:21** on my feelings more help me label them, contextualize them and move on rather than

**00:37:28** necessarily being like about them like weeks and weeks and weeks. But I think though that there is

**00:37:36** a spectrum of people between me and you and different people are going to feel differently

**00:37:41** about the way this is. And realistically, this tool is maybe for more people like me than people

**00:37:47** like you. Yeah, I think so. Trust me, I'm aware that I'm a bit of an outlier in this conversation.

**00:37:55** I'm the weirder one. I think you're the much more normal person in this conversation. I do just find

**00:38:00** it just very strange to try to internalize what you mean by a sentence of like having a feeling

**00:38:07** and you don't know what it is. Like I just, I cannot even conceptualize what that means. Like

**00:38:15** it's very strange to me, but if I try to internalize that as like, oh, that's a state of existence that

**00:38:21** could be, then yes, maybe getting a notification that at that moment forces me to try to

**00:38:28** clarify what, like a collection of physical associations into an emotion. I don't even

**00:38:36** I don't even know, but like, I guess if you are unaware that you're having a

**00:38:43** an unclear emotion, perhaps being forced to clarify that is helpful in and of itself.

**00:38:49** Taking that on board, I think I could understand that. And again, it's like, oh, Mike's talking me

**00:38:55** back into like, maybe this is good. Maybe I should be less concerned if I think I'm just an outlier

**00:39:00** in this conversation. I mean, look, I don't know, but my gut suggests that you are. Yeah. Whoever

**00:39:07** at Apple is working on this thing. The one that really says to me more than anything like this

**00:39:12** app is not made for me is when you go like, how do you feel right now? And it starts in the middle.

**00:39:17** It says neutral, which again, for me is like 95% of the time would be my answer.

**00:39:23** If I click next, it's the only one that has a very different set of tags. So it says,

**00:39:29** what best describes this feeling? Content, calm, peaceful. And I look at that and I think

**00:39:37** no one who feels neutral would have those three as the only three options. Well, you see,

**00:39:44** this is where I disagree with you. If you're neutral, they are like the perfect descriptors.

**00:39:49** Like if you're feeling neutral, what else would you be feeling? Do you know what I want to have

**00:39:54** as an option? Neutral. That's what one of those tags, it's like, why do you want the room cold?

**00:39:59** I would like the room cold. How do you feel right now? I feel neutral. I guess in that situation,

**00:40:04** I believe you can just log the feeling. You don't actually have to put anything. So like,

**00:40:08** you could do that. Cause I've done that, right? And like in these situations where like,

**00:40:12** I don't get to give it more. You can just click next, next done. Like, I'm like,

**00:40:17** you can just click next, next done. Like, you know, when I can't find the words that I want,

**00:40:22** but I would like to be able to log the words that I want, but you can just log the feeling.

**00:40:26** But yeah, to me, like if you're feeling neutral, I see content, calm, peaceful,

**00:40:30** indifferent and drained. Oh, you've drained? That's very strange.

**00:40:36** Clearly. Here's the thing. Content, calm and peaceful to be all register as positive feelings

**00:40:41** and drained would be a negative feeling. So it's indifferent to me. Indifferent,

**00:40:45** I see as a negative. The indifferent is the only one that should be in the neutral category.

**00:40:49** Right. Indifferent is clearly a neutral thing. Right.

**00:40:53** I know what you're saying, but I just don't really feel like being indifferent is like a good thing.

**00:40:57** Like to me, that doesn't register as like a good emotion to be feeling.

**00:41:03** You're putting emotional valence on the word indifferent that doesn't belong there. It's

**00:41:08** like, Oh, I'm indifferent to two outcomes. Right? Like I have no preference between these two.

**00:41:12** That's what that's what indifference is. Yeah. But I think that a life led indifferent is a life,

**00:41:17** not like it's not being lived. Like you've got to have an opinion about everything. Great. Come on.

**00:41:22** Good, bad. Otherwise what's the point? You know, no, indifference should be your default state of

**00:41:26** being. No, I'm very different. I'm team indifferent. This episode of Cortex is brought to you by

**00:43:36** show and relay FM. In installing iOS 17, I have become a mag safe person. I am a mag safe believer

**00:43:44** now. Oh, is this what it finally took? It took standby, standby mode. Yeah, standby is super good.

**00:43:51** I've read. Aren't you worried about the fires though, Mike? What about all that heat that's

**00:43:55** being produced by the magnets and the electricity? Isn't that, isn't that concerning to you? I mean,

**00:43:58** yeah, it's concerning to me. And also realistically, I'm concerned about my battery health of my phone

**00:44:02** as well, which I know has taken a dive. I don't know if it's standby related, but my battery

**00:44:06** health has gone down. I think that's the beta. That's not the, that's not the charging itself,

**00:44:10** or I'd be very surprised if it was, you know, wireless charging still not a super big fan of

**00:44:15** it, but standby is worth it. I'll take the risk of the fires. Maybe it will change the heat of the

**00:44:19** thermostat and it will be good. You should do, you should put your mag safe charger next to the

**00:44:24** thermostat. I'm also just realizing there's a thing that I, that I've, I think I've told you

**00:44:28** before, but again, I'll just, it probably doesn't make you feel better to know that I put money in

**00:44:33** between my case and the phone. So there's like a little bit of kindling there, wicking for the,

**00:44:38** for the maxi charger to light. It hasn't caused a problem in all of these years, but I just, you

**00:44:44** know, so you can sleep a little less comfortably at night. Know that my phone is always charging

**00:44:49** with like a tiny bit of money. That's just waiting to catch fire. Just a little fire style. Just a

**00:44:53** little, just a little kindling. Yeah. Kindling never hurt anybody. It's really interesting to

**00:44:57** hear you say that, that like you've been, I don't know, like a mag safe denier for 10 years now.

**00:45:02** You haven't wanted to do it, but standby is the thing. This got you over the hump. Yeah. Because

**00:45:09** look for me, I was already charging my phone fine. Like I had spent a decade finding the product that

**00:45:16** I liked to charge my phone and I found it to be very convenient. I was using a dock where I just

**00:45:21** pop it in and it was no problem. It wasn't like I was fumbling around for cables. I knew where the

**00:45:26** charging always was and it was just very easy. So the idea of having just a different kind of

**00:45:31** dock that was magnetic rather than place in it where it needs to be, like that was just,

**00:45:35** it was just a problem I didn't need to solve. But standby is a feature. So like, you know,

**00:45:42** my phone is over there on my little anchor three in one cube, which is a cool product that I have.

**00:45:48** Adorable. I've got one. Yep. I can look at it right now and I have a timer from timer. And I

**00:45:53** have my weather as little widgets and they cycle through on their own. Sometimes I get a clock.

**00:45:58** Sometimes I get some photos, you know, or I can scroll over to the next one and see some like

**00:46:03** nice images that iOS is pulling out for me. Like it's just a very good feature to make my phone

**00:46:10** useful for the majority of my workday when it is sitting on a dock.

**00:46:17** Maybe that's what it is. The reason I was asking you is when I watched the presentation and they

**00:46:24** showed like, Oh, we have this new thing standby where you put your phone on the dock and then it

**00:46:28** shows you this information in a beautiful way. And in the presentation where it's like, Oh,

**00:46:33** we also have like VR helmets, right? That was the only thing that also just stuck out into my mind

**00:46:38** after VR blew it away. It was like, Oh, there's that standby thing. And when I installed the beta,

**00:46:44** it's like, I'm almost baffled by why do I love this feature so much? Like I think it's amazingly

**00:46:51** great, but I like it so much. I'm almost confused by why do I like this so much? So like on this

**00:46:59** trip, normally I just bring up with me a bunch of little wireless charging pads, but I specifically

**00:47:05** brought that anchor cube over there because like I want to see standby in my hotel room. It's like,

**00:47:12** I just love it. And yeah, I mean, for me most of the time it's just showing the weather or the clock.

**00:47:18** And then I have the little battery progress meters and it's like, man, I just love seeing this. It's

**00:47:24** great, but it's almost baffling because it's simultaneously a little nothing of a feature,

**00:47:30** but also having shown it to some other people, everyone has the same reaction of like, Oh,

**00:47:36** I absolutely love this. Well, I mean, it's why we like widgets, right? It's just like, this is just

**00:47:40** like for the, whenever your phone is charging, it's just this like little permanent widget machine,

**00:47:45** just always showing you something, right? Which is interesting to you or helpful to you or useful to

**00:47:50** you or pretty in some way. It's like, I just think it's just very, very good. I really do think you

**00:47:56** nailed it though. It makes the phone useful all the time. Whereas in its default state, it's not.

**00:48:03** And like the lock screen widgets were halfway there, but I guess the difference is with the lock

**00:48:09** screen widgets, they're still only useful when you're holding the phone right before you open

**00:48:15** it to show you some information. So you were already going to do something. It's not enough

**00:48:19** information. Even if like, even though like you can have them on the always on, which I did,

**00:48:23** it's just too small. Yeah. And yeah, I want another row. The four is infuriating. But yeah,

**00:48:28** I guess maybe that's what it is. I'm like, Oh, I can just, it's big and visible. And again,

**00:48:34** like those little, those little battery circles, like I just love at a glance knowing, Oh, I forgot

**00:48:40** to plug in my headphones. Like when I left the office and they're running low, like it just,

**00:48:44** it's really nice to be able to see that at a glance all the time. So I'm also glad it finally

**00:48:49** got you on the, on the mag safe train. And now you can, now you can have fun with the whole world

**00:48:53** of mag safe accessories, of which there are a bazillion. Yeah. Cause I'm, you know, I'm still

**00:48:58** using my pop socket, but I just take it off, put it on the charger and then just when I pick up my

**00:49:03** phone, just pop the pop socket back on the back again. And that has actually been something which

**00:49:07** has become very natural for me. Like I don't really think about it. I'm happy with how that's

**00:49:12** going that I was worried that that was going to be frustrating, but it hasn't been at all really.

**00:49:16** Yeah. I do wonder if that will eventually go away as a habit for you. Cause that does seem like an

**00:49:21** annoying extra step, but, but the utility I get out of the pop socket is worth it for me. Like the

**00:49:27** biggest thing that I love about pop sockets now, it's not even holding it. It's how easy it is to

**00:49:33** watch video, which I watch a lot of, Oh, to use it as a little stand all the time. I will just say,

**00:49:39** last thing on iOS 17, when I wrote the show notes a couple of days ago, I wrote like, this is this,

**00:49:44** for me, like the top feature of iOS 17 standby. And I still think so, but I'm getting more

**00:49:52** interactive widgets and there is some. Banana stuff happening. Oh, right. Cause you're out,

**00:49:58** you get all the cool test flight invitations. I'm on a few betas and I know of there being some

**00:50:04** others that I'm not on, but I know what's going on. Right. It was some developers and like people

**00:50:09** are doing things, right? It's like, you've got your ear to the ground. Ooh, that's very exciting.

**00:50:15** Yeah. There's some, there is some stuff happening right now. And, uh, it's, I'm excited about it

**00:50:23** because with the original widgets, it was like, Oh, this is nice. And then you'd start to see a few

**00:50:27** things like, Oh, okay. There's some cool stuff going on here. But I feel like I'm seeing more

**00:50:33** really interesting things this time around than I even did with the original widgets when they came

**00:50:38** to iOS 15 or whatever it was. People are doing some really cool stuff. And it seems like Apple

**00:50:45** kind of underplayed this system, like what it was capable of. Like one of the biggest things that I

**00:50:51** have seen of just like an idea, which I never even conceived of is like, I've seen a bunch of widgets

**00:50:57** that allow you to scroll through pages of information effectively. Uh, what? So it's

**00:51:03** like, they're like a pseudo stack of informational pages. So I'll use, I'll use timer as an example,

**00:51:08** because Joe has been open like online about what he's building. I don't want you to break

**00:51:13** anyone's secrets here. Yeah. So in timer, you can set up saved time tracking entries, right? So you

**00:51:20** can have a bunch of things that you're saved timers that you can just fire off easily. And he has had

**00:51:25** a widget of saved timers for a while, but it can only show an amount of timers in it. Right. So you

**00:51:29** could say you could have five in there or whatever. Well, he's has the ability now in one of these

**00:51:34** widgets where you can check a box in the configuration of that widget to show pages.

**00:51:38** So you, for example, would see four and then a little button to go to the next page. Oh, okay.

**00:51:45** Of saved timers. So it's one widget, but you're able to load multiple views in that widget.

**00:51:53** I think that, that, that it has been underplayed and I am very keen to see what developers have

**00:51:59** worked out what they can do. I completely forgot this even existed as a feature,

**00:52:04** the interactive widgets. Like I just, I just didn't remember this at all. And I think, oh,

**00:52:09** no, I have just spent a huge amount of time trying to redo the configuration for all of my widgets,

**00:52:16** for all of the home screens, for all of my focus modes, which ended up being like quite a lot of

**00:52:21** work to put them all the way that I want them to be. And it feels like, Oh, right. I forgot. Every

**00:52:26** single widget is going to be completely overhauled. And this is going to just throw all of my work

**00:52:32** right up into the air to be redone again. But that's very exciting. So I've been working on

**00:52:37** something for a while that I'm very excited about that is very far away from now. Relay FM just

**00:52:43** turned nine years old. It was on the 18th of August, nine, nine years old. That's horrifying.

**00:52:50** Nine is one away from 10. Yep. To celebrate our 10th anniversary, we're going to be doing

**00:52:56** a live show similar to what we did for our fifth anniversary. We did that in San Francisco. We had

**00:53:03** a large host of relay FM personalities come in. And we played a game of family feud or family

**00:53:09** fortunes if you're in the UK is the same game, different name. And we had a great time. Well,

**00:53:14** we're doing it again. Similar makeup. We're for our 10th anniversary show next year, we're going

**00:53:19** to be having a live show and we're going to be playing family feud, but it will especially be

**00:53:25** called family fortunes because it's going to be in London live in London live in London. You can

**00:53:33** go to relay.fm slash London to go and get tickets. Tickets are available now. It's going to be on

**00:53:39** Saturday, July 27th, 2024. It's going to feature many of your favorite relay FM hosts. We have a

**00:53:46** bunch of hosts here in the UK and there are going to be a bunch of hosts that are going to

**00:53:50** be traveling in for it, which I'm super excited about. I cannot even truly describe how much this

**00:53:57** means to me. Yeah. Yeah. That we will be able to do a show in the city I grew up in and all my

**00:54:05** family will be there to see what I do. Like one of the things I keep, I keep mentioning this to

**00:54:11** friends when I talk about it, which is like my family know what I do for a living, right?

**00:54:17** They're aware of it, but I feel like no one really understands like what it is, you know,

**00:54:24** but I feel like being in a beautiful theater and coming out on stage and people applaud,

**00:54:32** then they'll understand what I do for a living. You know, like, I feel like it might like get it

**00:54:37** across a little bit that like there are people that listen to the podcast that I make and enjoy

**00:54:42** them, you know, rather than it just being like Michael does that thing that he does. Do you

**00:54:47** notice I said Michael too, because no one in my family calls me Mike. Everyone calls me Michael.

**00:54:52** So like Michael's over there doing the stuff that he does. Yeah. We're also going to be doing it in

**00:54:56** one of my favorite venues in London. It's supposed to be the Hackney empire. Yeah. Gorgeous theater.

**00:55:00** Absolutely. So a few months ago, I went to a show at the Hackney empire

**00:55:06** and we knew that we wanted to do the live show in London. We've been talking about it for a long

**00:55:10** time and I was at the empire and I was like, yeah, this is, I want to do it here. Like this is where

**00:55:16** I want to do it. Like, because the Hackney empire looks as beautiful as any theater you could

**00:55:22** imagine in London, right? And it's in East London. It's not in the West End. So it's something we can

**00:55:29** afford to do. But also it means that we can get it a good time, right? Like a Saturday evening,

**00:55:35** you know, not all theaters are going to be able to provide you with this. Like we looked at some of

**00:55:40** the theaters in the West End and it could be like, well, you can have two o'clock in the afternoon on

**00:55:43** a Wednesday. It's like, that's no time. I don't want to do that. And I am so incredibly excited

**00:55:51** about this. If you're in the United Kingdom, you should buy a ticket and come to the show,

**00:55:57** prove that we should do more shows in the United Kingdom. If you're in Europe, hell, if you're in

**00:56:02** America, come over and see it. This show is going to be awesome. We're taking a slight departure

**00:56:08** from other live shows and we are focusing on making it the best it can be just for the people

**00:56:14** in the room. We will be endeavoring to record this show. And if we do get a good recording of it,

**00:56:19** we're working with the theater on this. We will be releasing it to everyone, but I really want to

**00:56:23** make this a special event for the people that can make it. So please buy a ticket and come and see

**00:56:28** us do our thing in July of 2024. I think that's a good decision because when you do this kind of

**00:56:33** thing, you always have to, always have to ultimately decide like who is the audience

**00:56:39** for this thing. And when you first told me about this idea of like, it is for the people in the

**00:56:45** room that really clarifies a bunch of decisions. I'm like, what are you going to do? And so everything

**00:56:51** has always been more complicated because we have tried to have like audio and a live stream and

**00:56:58** like, it's like, no, we're just going to do this. Like video can't work in the space. So we'd knock

**00:57:04** that one out. We're going to use the equipment that the technicians at the theater will provide

**00:57:09** for us, which will make things way easier. It means that we don't need to bring all of our

**00:57:13** own gear, which we have in the past, which is going to be more complicated because Steven has

**00:57:17** all of that and he'll be coming over from Memphis. It's just like, it's just easier to just trust

**00:57:21** the technicians. They know what they're doing. They told us they'll be able to get an audio

**00:57:25** recording, which I'm sure that they will. But the best way to experience our 10th anniversary

**00:57:30** extravaganza is to be in one of these beautiful seats in this incredible theater in London and

**00:57:36** see it. Yeah. And prove the viability of an in-person show in London. And also I feel like

**00:57:41** gotta buy a ticket so that Mike's family sees a packed theater in London. Oh, yes. It totally

**00:57:48** is a thing of podcasting. It's a strange job because you have both of these things of like,

**00:57:55** oh, I'm talking to thousands and thousands of people, but I'm also in a room all by myself

**00:58:03** all day. Right. And I feel like that's the thing that you have. And whenever you're explaining

**00:58:09** your job to people, it's like, well, oh, lots of people listen to me. Trust me. It's like,

**00:58:13** ah, but when I look at you, I see you just in a room by yourself. It doesn't seem like it. So

**00:58:18** I want you to come out on stage to like a packed theater. And I think we can do that.

**00:58:22** That's what I want. I would say like over the history of this show, the Cortexons have provided

**00:58:26** me with many of these incredible life moments. Like I remember like the podcons and stuff like

**00:58:30** that, right? Where my booth lines were way longer and they were underestimated how many people were

**00:58:35** coming. And it was awesome, right? For like the signings I would do and stuff like that.

**00:58:39** And I'm asking for another one and it is, I want to feel the energy of 1200 people inside of a

**00:58:47** theater. Like, what does that feel like? Like I live an incredible life where a bunch of wild

**00:58:54** things happen to me. I don't know if I'll ever experience that thing again. Right. I want to

**00:58:59** feel what it's like to walk out onto a stage and have 1200 people cheering. Like that,

**00:59:05** feels like something that only a small few people in the world will ever experience.

**00:59:11** And I am pleading you to give me that experience because we can do it,

**00:59:17** guy. We can do it. Yeah. I'm going to say Cortexons in Europe, buy a ticket,

**00:59:22** come see the show Cortexons in America, make a trip out of it. London, an amazing city to visit,

**00:59:28** easily one of the best cities on earth. Totally worth it just for a trip on its own.

**00:59:33** And when Mike comes out on that stage for his bomb, I want you to go like wild, right? With like

**00:59:40** excitement and applause. It's also just, I cannot believe that this is finally happening. Because I,

**00:59:47** you know, years ago you vaguely mentioned to me like when the date of Relay FM's 10th anniversary

**00:59:54** was, you know, and it's like, Oh, I put that on my calendar or whatever. And it's like,

**00:59:58** ah, but that will never come. And it's like, here we are. It's 10 years later. Like, you know,

**01:00:05** you and Steven have been running like a successful podcasting company for 10 years. It's just,

**01:00:12** it's both crazy, like how fast time has gone and also like how much you guys have done. And it's,

**01:00:19** it's great to be doing like a live show as, as part of like a real celebration and acknowledgement

**01:00:25** of that accomplishment. And that's what it's really going to be. And that's what I'm, you know,

**01:00:30** we will, we were concerned when we decided to do it in London that maybe we'd have like a much

**01:00:35** smaller group of hosts that would be able to participate, but we've been super happy that

**01:00:39** there are a bunch of people that like want to make the trip. And so like the roster to be determined,

**01:00:44** right? Like that is, that is a to be announced situation right now, but it is going to be a

**01:00:50** fantastic time full of awesome people. We're going to have a great time and we're purposely

**01:00:55** doing the kind of show where like you could bring a friend or a partner with you. We're not

**01:00:59** going to be doing like a, let's talk about the newest thing in technology we'll be doing. Like,

**01:01:05** if you've seen Family Feud, you've seen Family Fortunes, we'll be putting out like a poll

**01:01:09** to people, people will answer questions like what's your favorite movie, you know, like all

**01:01:13** of that kind of stuff. And then the host just have to try and guess what the audience say. Like,

**01:01:16** it's a very good format for fun times. And I'm really looking forward to it. And I cannot wait

**01:01:22** to host in my own city. Oh man, I'm so excited. Relay.fm slash London. It's the Relay.fm 10th

**01:01:30** anniversary show live in London. Tickets on sale now. This episode of Cortex is brought to you by

**01:03:06** Wearr smartwatch and apps like Strava, Fitbit and Apple Health. I really love the Apple Watch

**01:03:10** integration. So when I'm doing my FitBod exercises, I can see what exercise I've got coming up now and

**01:03:16** I can change the sets and the reps if I want to. I can also advance through them. And then if it's

**01:03:20** an exercise that I'm unfamiliar with, I can go to my phone and watch the videos. It's a great combo.

**01:03:49** and Relay FM. In this episode, I was talking about feeling a little like, you know, having feelings,

**01:03:56** big feelings, mics having big feelings and anxiety and stress and stuff. Past few weeks,

**01:04:01** there's a bunch of things going on, right? So the aforementioned live show getting that ready,

**01:04:07** September is like around the corner. It's fundraising time for St. Jude and podcastathon.

**01:04:12** As we approach the end of the year, Cortex brand almost explodes with energy for like any other

**01:04:20** physical product business. I posted about this on threads the other day that I've realized that like,

**01:04:26** if you run a physical products business, your entire year is the holidays. Yes, I know. Like,

**01:04:32** I feel like we just recovered from the holidays and now we are preparing for the holidays. Again,

**01:04:39** that ended a year time for any businesses. Like there's always a lot going on, especially if you

**01:04:45** have like a product that's focused around, you know, getting a push for new year. Like we have

**01:04:51** at the theme system journal. So like I've got a bunch of stuff going on and I have like a pretty

**01:04:57** hectic personal life right now. We have mother in law in town and we've got like a bunch of things

**01:05:02** going on as well. Um, just finishing off a renovation. I just feel very overwhelmed,

**01:05:09** but I think a lot of it is coming from running two businesses. Yeah. Yeah. This is a thing where

**01:05:18** this year we sort of talked about it before, but like Cortex brand has become very really real this

**01:05:26** year for us, which also beads like I'm sure we'll talk about like very really terrifying with some

**01:05:32** of the decisions that we have to make with regards to it. And I mean, yes, I have another business,

**01:05:40** but like I don't run two businesses in the same way that you do. Relay is just a completely

**01:05:47** different beast. And then to have Cortex brand on top of it, like the last quarter of the year is

**01:05:54** always the busiest quarter of the year. And every year it comes around like you tell me what your

**01:05:59** schedule is like for the last three or four months. And I get anxiety by proxy just listening to you.

**01:06:05** But if we think about your 10 years of being in the business, it's like, oh, every final quarter

**01:06:12** got like 20 to 50% busier every year. But it feels like for you this year, it is like

**01:06:19** four times busier than it was last year, or like there's four times as much stuff on the line. So

**01:06:26** I honestly don't know how you're handling it at all.

**01:06:32** I don't even lie. Just to put this into a little bit of context, right? So like,

**01:06:38** obviously I do time tracking. I have in the first seven months of this year have tracked over twice

**01:06:44** the amount of hours for Cortex brand than I did all of last year, which is quite a growth.

**01:06:51** Yeah, that's a really big growth.

**01:06:53** And so I feel like that that is indicative of the efforts that we've been putting in this year.

**01:06:59** We've done a lot more marketing, a lot of stuff that no one's seen yet, because we're just like

**01:07:03** trying to get more ducks in a row. And we're working on new products, and we're working on

**01:07:10** bigger strategy stuff. And it's just like a lot of things that we're lining up for eventually,

**01:07:17** right? But there is just like a lot more of it happening than we've had in the past. And at the

**01:07:23** moment, like, you know, you're saying about like, I write a good thing and a bad thing in my journal

**01:07:28** every day. And the last couple of weeks, my bad thing has been something along the lines of,

**01:07:34** I'm behind, or my workload is too heavy right now. And because this is also, I'm not sacrificing

**01:07:42** my theme this year, the year of the weekend, it's been awesome. And I look forward to talking about

**01:07:47** it in more detail at the end of the year.

**01:07:48** I'm happy to hear that. Because I was wondering, like, is this the thing that's crumbling? And I

**01:07:53** was I was hoping not. So obviously, we, again, we have this weird thing where it's like, we don't

**01:07:58** talk to each other very much about our themes. So I don't really know. But I was like, boy, I'm,

**01:08:02** I was really hoping for you that you're not caving on that. So I'm happy to hear that. But it sure

**01:08:08** doesn't make things easier.

**01:08:09** No, because I'm not sacrificing my personal time. And I'm adding more hobbies in and I'm adding

**01:08:14** more time with people in my life that I care about in person, like I'm still doing all of those

**01:08:18** things. And I think it is what is helping to smooth out the rough edges of my workload right now. And

**01:08:25** just the pressure of the responsibilities that I have. But also, it does mean I have less time to

**01:08:35** potentially do all the things that I want to do. Right? Like work wise. And so like, I'm in this

**01:08:40** tightrope walk right now of trying to manage all this stuff. But it's like the tightrope walk within

**01:08:47** a tightrope walk, which is just two businesses. It really feels like now more than ever, there are

**01:08:53** two businesses where like I felt like I had relay and then Cortex Brown was this thing we were

**01:09:00** working on.

**01:09:00** Yeah. It's like a side project for both of us. But yeah, it's growing to not be that very fast.

**01:09:06** Yes. In the sense of also that like, I feel like we have like in this past week or so taken our

**01:09:14** first like risk.

**01:09:19** Yeah, I'm not quite sure I agree with that.

**01:09:23** But what else would it have been?

**01:09:26** I feel like I would want to look. Okay. All right. So what's happening here is that we've just,

**01:09:34** we're taking a really big bet with sidekick notepad stock ordering. And it's like,

**01:09:41** here we are again, catching the eel, right? Like inventory management and what are we going to do?

**01:09:48** And spreadsheets can try to help you make decisions in normal times. But we've been

**01:09:52** talking a lot about trying to make a big bet about not having a normal time in this last

**01:10:01** quarter with sidekick sales. So like it'll be no surprise to anyone that's like, okay,

**01:10:07** ultimately I'm going to make a video promoting sidekick notepads and we're going to hope to

**01:10:12** sell a bunch of them. There's also things that we can try with advertising. And it is just the

**01:10:18** it's just the fact, like you said of a product business, we should expect that most of the

**01:10:24** business happens in the last quarter of the year. And I don't know, we've been talking for like

**01:10:32** two months seriously about how much of a bet do we take on this. And I guess I was thinking,

**01:10:40** oh, we've taken bigger bets in the past on the theme system journal, but I think

**01:10:48** I think, yeah, that's not comparable because there was just, there was like less at risk in some ways.

**01:10:55** Whereas this time it's like, boy, ordering a big amount of stock is a huge amount of money to

**01:11:02** outlay. And this, this is where it's like, we just don't have any real data to make a real decision

**01:11:09** on. And we're just, we're just guessing. So basically, gray has made two videos about

**01:11:14** the journal. And each time we sold out of what we had available. And so I don't want that to happen

**01:11:24** with the psychic notepad. Yes. So when gray makes a video and we publish the video and people see

**01:11:29** it maybe for the first time and they decide this looks cool and I want to buy one, I want them to

**01:11:33** be able to go to the website and buy one. Like, yes. And I want to do all we can to mitigate that

**01:11:40** because my feeling is it's fun and maybe cute for us with the journal when we couldn't keep it in

**01:11:47** stock. And we came up with the eel metaphor, right? Of like, you know, we are, we just can't get our

**01:11:52** heads around this. But I feel like at a certain point, if we want to be taken seriously, we have

**01:11:57** to be able to control our inventory. Yeah. Yeah. I feel like you can't just keep being in this

**01:12:03** scenario. And I know that there are businesses that run this way and it is. And I understand the

**01:12:08** potential thinking that is an effective marketing tactic. And I think that it worked well for us

**01:12:14** with the journal. I think that because we kept selling out, we did sell maybe more faster

**01:12:20** initially because people were like, I don't know this, but I can see there is an argument, right?

**01:12:25** That like every time we put them in stock, we would sell out. And it might have been like a

**01:12:28** thing where some people were like, if I'm interested in one of these, I have to try and

**01:12:33** get one as soon as I can get one because these guys can't keep them in stock. Right. And I,

**01:12:37** I understand that as like, you know, everyone over about my age remembers the Nintendo Wii.

**01:12:43** And that was always a thing with the Nintendo Wii. Nintendo couldn't keep it in stock. And there was

**01:12:47** always rumors around like, were they stock limiting it? So it created. I just, I just don't

**01:12:52** believe like, okay, I'm just, I'm sorry. I just have to interject here because I just refuse to

**01:12:56** accept this as a valid business strategy with the only asterisk of like, is your business in

**01:13:03** fashion in some way? I think that's the only world where this is really true.

**01:13:08** You're creating a supply demand issue and then that can create some element of scarcity and that

**01:13:14** scarcity can drive interest or prices. Right. Like it's the thing that happens. It's, it is,

**01:13:20** what I'm saying is a thing that either people believe is a tactic or is a tactic or is a mixture

**01:13:25** of the both or whatever. But that wasn't what we wanted to do. Yeah. It wasn't what we wanted to

**01:13:30** do at all. I wanted to sell one to every single person that could buy one. That's how I feel with

**01:13:34** the psychic notepad this time. So we have placed an order, which is like stupid. It makes me

**01:13:41** physically uncomfortable to think about. Yeah, it really does. But it's like, I have to keep

**01:13:46** reminding myself of the thing that you're saying right now, which is we are placing this order

**01:13:53** to be guaranteed that we don't run out of stock. But we also don't know that as well.

**01:13:59** That's it. I know. I know. But like we're taking the best bet.

**01:14:06** But the thing is if we run out of stock, if we run out of stock,

**01:14:10** I will be content that we did all we could. If we sell out of the amount that we're buying,

**01:14:15** it will, I mean, look, it will be incredible for the business, right? If we sell out of the amount

**01:14:19** that we're buying because we are overstocking by such a large amount, if we do, I will be content

**01:14:24** that we could not realistically afford to buy more of them. Yeah, we literally couldn't have

**01:14:29** bought that. There wasn't more that Cortex brand could do to prevent this. And so like,

**01:14:36** that's just going to be the way it goes. And then we've learned another lesson.

**01:14:41** Yeah, I guess that's also a part of the feeling of like, I know that that's true, but it also

**01:14:47** means we've like once again done the thing of like, oh, put it all on black, roll the wheel.

**01:14:54** And it's like, yes, we're doing that because like, well, we really don't want to do it. I'm also

**01:14:58** talking to myself here in case it's not obvious because we don't want to do is we don't want to

**01:15:05** sell out. That's very bad. I just don't believe in the marketing of like, oh, you generate hype.

**01:15:11** So you sell more. No, selling more is selling more not generating high because also this product

**01:15:17** takes a long while to produce. Yes. From order to delivery is about 15 weeks.

**01:15:24** Yes. So really long time to be out of stock, right? Like it's a really, really long time.

**01:15:30** And as always, the huge asterisk with that is 15 weeks, if everything goes right, and things can

**01:15:36** always go wrong. And then it could be months. We don't know if this if the paper will even be

**01:15:40** available. And like we had that like when we made the original set, we had to wait an extra few

**01:15:45** weeks because they needed to make the paper. So we like the coffee cup paper had to be made

**01:15:51** because the amount that we wanted they didn't have. But as I said, like if we sell out,

**01:15:57** then I'll know that we did all we could. And then it's just a case of like, we've learned

**01:16:02** a valuable thing because what we genuinely do not know, and I don't think anybody can tell us

**01:16:08** is like a video that gets seen by half a million to say a million people.

**01:16:13** Let's say half a million people say half a million. I'm just looking at the two, right? So

**01:16:16** the original journal video you did was half a million. The other one was 1.6 million. So I'm

**01:16:21** just saying, let's just say half a million, right? Yeah, I predict that this video will be much

**01:16:25** closer to the first journal video. But let's just say half. Let's say half a million then, right?

**01:16:31** If 500,000 people watch a video about a product, how many buy it? I have no idea. Exactly. We don't

**01:16:39** know. But like, yeah, we will be attempting to take another step in understanding what that

**01:16:47** number is. And like, look, I understand, right? Completely different product, completely different

**01:16:51** price point, completely different thing. I don't, I genuinely can't tell you which one or the other

**01:16:59** makes more sense to buy, right? Like the theme system journal was a cheaper product and it is a

**01:17:04** cheaper product than the psychic notepad. And it has like a whole story around it that you can,

**01:17:09** you know, you build your life around this theme. But to buy the journal, you have to decide you

**01:17:14** want to set a yearly theme. Yeah. There's like an onboarding process. It's a pro anicon for its

**01:17:19** story. Psychic notepad is a more expensive product, but it also can be used by anyone.

**01:17:25** So like the amount of people, like the barrier to entry of imagining this product in your life

**01:17:31** is way lower, I think, than the theme system journals is. Yeah. It's interesting for me. So

**01:17:36** this is, this is also like, what's so nerve wracking about this from a business perspective

**01:17:40** is just the YouTube variable of like, you just never know how much a thing gets seen and how

**01:17:45** much it gets resonated with people. This is also why it's like placing a big bet on the stock is

**01:17:52** terrifying because you just never know what's going to happen on the other end. And I'm going

**01:17:56** to put a call out to the Cortexons because like at this point we've sold a ton of psychic notepads

**01:18:03** and people are using them. And I would like even more feedback from people who are using it and

**01:18:10** who like it. What is it that you like about it? Okay. As you said, the theme system journal,

**01:18:16** you can use it in different ways, but there's a very particular concept behind it. We just had

**01:18:21** dinner the other evening with our friend underscore widget Smith. And it was interesting. I was talking

**01:18:26** to him about using it and it's like, Oh, he laid out a way that he uses the sidekick, which I would

**01:18:32** have never thought about. And I was like, Oh, that's really interesting. I feel like I'm in the

**01:18:37** process of trying to like gather up since there's a less clear message about this. What is it that

**01:18:44** resonates with people? And like, I would just love to know like the details, the specifics,

**01:18:51** if you bought it and you like it, what exactly why I have some thoughts about that. I have a

**01:18:58** bunch of directions. Like, where do I think I'm going to go with this? But like that conversation

**01:19:02** with underscore was just like very unexpectedly enlightening in a interesting way for me of like,

**01:19:08** Oh, I just would never have thought of that. That is literally the opposite of the way I use it. And

**01:19:14** so he kind of had a better way to use it than the way I use it. I was like, Oh, that's genius.

**01:19:19** All right. I'm going to get the calls to action. So you can either go to cortexfeedback.com

**01:19:23** and you can just leave us some follow up there or some feedback there about it or on threads

**01:19:28** or Instagram. We are at cortex brand. You can send us a post on threads. You can send us a

**01:19:34** message on Instagram and we'll collate it together. I will say, great. I will share with you in our

**01:19:38** notion. I did ask for some testimonials recently because we're looking to do some stuff with

**01:19:42** marketing. We have a very beautiful like template for posting testimonials, which I will share with

**01:19:47** you. There was some fascinating things in there, but we do want more of them. So please send them

**01:19:52** to us at these places. And also those places because this is another one of these things of

**01:19:57** we're trying to grow the business in a bunch of different ways. And so listen, straight up guys,

**01:20:02** like we just want bigger numbers on Instagram and threads. Like that matters. That's an important

**01:20:07** thing. Give us a follow on those platforms because I think it really matters. We're very chill. Like

**01:20:12** we don't post a ton. It's fun. I'm also like, I'm still living up to the original bargain of the

**01:20:18** Cortex brand Instagram account. I do post pictures of unreleased things there every now and again on

**01:20:24** our stories. I give little hints of some stuff that we're working on. So if you do care about that,

**01:20:28** it is a good place to get some of that information. And this is one of those things I mentioned like

**01:20:32** marketing earlier, right? So like one of the other projects that I'm managing is like trying to

**01:20:38** beef up and sort out like our Instagram page and the story and the story we tell around our

**01:20:44** business and stuff like that, which is like a whole other big thing. So Kerry, who is chief

**01:20:49** advertising officer at Relay FM is also helping us with marketing Cortex brand. She's very good at

**01:20:55** all that kind of stuff too. And all the other things she's good at. And one of the things that

**01:20:58** she told me about Instagram is she's like, your Instagram profile page is like your storefront.

**01:21:03** I was like, Oh, that's really smart. And so like, we've done a bunch of stuff for tidying it up and

**01:21:07** we're going to do some more. But for me, one of the things that I know that I do all the time is I go

**01:21:11** to an Instagram account and see how many followers there are. And it's like an indication of whether

**01:21:16** that business is real or not. Yep. It's like subscribers on a YouTube channel. It's just a

**01:21:20** first check number to verify, Oh, do other people find this useful? So we want to bump that number.

**01:21:27** Please. Please make Mike's life slightly less stressful. Those numbers look better.

**01:23:32** of this show and all of Relay FM. I feel like I'm going to be a little bit more

**01:23:38** of a fan. I feel like in talking through that, I hope is giving an idea to people of like,

**01:23:43** this is just one of the things in one of my businesses that I am dealing with right now,

**01:23:50** which is like, they're really big things, right? Like operating a live show for 1200 people in

**01:23:57** London in 10 months time. God knows if we'll sell the tickets, right? Like we think we will. It's

**01:24:02** why we took the bet, but we, we've never done a live show outside of America before. So we don't

**01:24:06** know. Just the first time you do anything, it's like the unknown unknowns are everywhere. You

**01:24:14** just have no idea what you're going to run into as an unexpected problem. Yeah. It's just like,

**01:24:19** you've got the live show again, the podcastathon, which like every year grows in new and interesting

**01:24:27** ways in complexity is like, yes. And we are as always growing the complexity of it. Once again,

**01:24:32** we'll talk about it in the next couple of weeks. I feel sick already about it being even more. It's

**01:24:38** like, you've got so much going on bike. But yeah, there's the pressure of raising hundreds of

**01:24:42** thousands of dollars for charity, which we want to keep doing forever, but it's like, it takes a lot

**01:24:46** of work now, you know, like thankfully with the live show and the podcastathon, these are actually

**01:24:52** both areas that Steven manages, especially the podcastathon, but they're still in my mind.

**01:24:59** Right. And sometimes that's the stuff like, you know, I don't have to put the hours in,

**01:25:04** but it's still like there in the brain. And I haven't even spoken about the fact

**01:25:09** that it's like iPhone time. Oh God. Right. Yeah. Of course.

**01:25:13** I was talking to a friend about this yesterday and they were like, Oh, and it's like

**01:25:17** iPhone time is busy feels like honestly, I don't even think about that anymore. Like I just

**01:25:22** roll with that. Like there's that's just happening anyway. And like, I have no control over that.

**01:25:28** So I'll just deal with that as it starts to occur to me. Right. Like, that's so funny.

**01:25:33** It is so funny that like at this point, how low in my, like what I consider it to be like a,

**01:25:40** like a quote unquote priority to be of like my attention, where I'm just like, the iPhone's

**01:25:45** coming. I know it's coming whenever it comes is when it comes and like the, the, the machine is

**01:25:50** oiled well enough right now that it just handles that. Like it's so funny how the priorities of

**01:25:58** shifted. They're like, I have these other things going on and it's like everything else is just

**01:26:04** hitting higher. Like, you know, September is one thing for me. Top priority without a doubt is

**01:26:09** St. Jude. I will put every hour I can into that and we'll just get it done. And it's so funny that

**01:26:15** like the iPhone comes and it's like, all right, I'll just squeeze that in. And like when I'm not

**01:26:20** raising money, I'll just like put these episodes in the most like important episodes of the year

**01:26:26** of upgrading connected. They just like go in there and it's fine. Yeah. The most, the most

**01:26:30** important event for the whole of the network is like, yeah. And also I'll do that. I guess I'd

**01:26:35** never really thought about it before, but it's a bit like this time of year is so busy because

**01:26:41** presumably what has basically happened over time is that with the iPhone being the tent pole event,

**01:26:47** it's also the time when you knew you could be most certain that most people are paying attention and

**01:26:52** tuning in and want to hear stuff. So you started doing these other events, but the other events

**01:26:58** have, it's, it's like they've completely grown to like over-consume the original event that they

**01:27:04** grew out of. It's like, oh, they were just tiny branches off of the trunk of the iPhone. But it's

**01:27:10** like, no, now these things are the massive tree. And the original thing from which they sprouted

**01:27:16** is just like a tiny little side branch. It's like, oh, oh, my. The iPhone also happens.

**01:27:23** It's not even in the list that I wrote in the show notes. Yeah. It's not even in the list. And

**01:27:28** the funny thing is I didn't think of it either. Looking at like, oh, what is Mike so busy with?

**01:27:32** It's like, it didn't even cross my mind of iPhone season. It's like, nope, didn't even make the top

**01:27:38** five list for what is going on in Mike's life that he's, he's so busy with. So like, how are you

**01:27:46** feeling, buddy? I mean, I'm stressed, right? Like, and, and for me, a time like this, it's not

**01:27:53** necessarily just the hours of work while they are increasing in some ways. It's not like they're

**01:27:59** unmanageable. It's just the way that it all makes me feel, which is like, right? There's just a lot

**01:28:06** of different things riding on all of these elements. What's riding on the 10th anniversary

**01:28:12** show is there being a sold out theater? Yes. I mean, there is money on the line, of course,

**01:28:17** too, right? Of like hiring the theater. Yeah. And then the podcast,athon is there's just

**01:28:24** expectation that we set about wanting to do a good job. Like I want to, like, cannot stress enough,

**01:28:30** like that St. Jude put no pressure on us to raise any amount of money, right? Like it just doesn't

**01:28:38** happen. They're just happy that we're involved and wanting to do anything. But me and Steven

**01:28:43** want to do a good job every time we just want to, because it means so much. It's the only reason to

**01:28:50** do it. Like, you didn't want to do a good job. You would drop this as a project. Like, there'd be no

**01:28:56** point in doing this, like, because it has a half ass project. Yeah. You're either like doing it or

**01:29:00** you're not doing it. And so like, we just keep wanting to like raise loads of money and like,

**01:29:06** make that a thing that continues and that we can all keep doing this thing as a community and like,

**01:29:13** move this project forward. And then you've got like, the potential future of our business isn't like

**01:29:21** riding on this, but it would certainly be helped if we've made the right decision.

**01:29:27** Where like, if we've made the wrong decision, it's just going to take a long time to resolve itself.

**01:29:34** Yeah. The problem, I think this is also a case where like you and I got together in person and

**01:29:40** we had to just like talk in person all freaking day through just a bunch of stuff. And I think

**01:29:48** part of it, yeah, it's like, if we guessed wrong here, it's not that we'd go bankrupt or anything,

**01:29:55** but I think what I hadn't appreciated before is if this goes wrong, if we like wildly overestimate

**01:30:04** the stock purchase and then like wildly undersell, so we just have this business problem where

**01:30:10** your capital is tied up in physical inventory and that has knock on effects for when can you place

**01:30:18** the next orders for the next projects that has knock on effects for marketing and all sorts of

**01:30:23** things. And so it's like, I intellectually knew that, but it's very different to have it quite

**01:30:30** viscerally sink in that the like the bet we're making here is that if it goes wrong, it slows

**01:30:38** down Cortex brand for like a year by tying up all of this capital. Like that's what's really on the

**01:30:45** line here. And that's the stressful part of it is this impacts other projects. It's not just a,

**01:30:53** oh, we'll launch something and we'll see how it does. Right. Which was like, like with the subtle

**01:30:59** notebook, which we did that was totally like, we'll launch it and we'll see how it does. And like,

**01:31:04** it's like, okay, great. We sell some, but it's not like, oh, if we didn't sell a bunch, it was going

**01:31:08** to impact the other products. But sidekick is now big enough that it really does. And that turns up

**01:31:16** the pressure. I will say like for us too, and it is worth remembering that like we were having

**01:31:21** conversations like this when the psychic notepad launched, like I was worried about the future of

**01:31:28** Cortex brand, if this product did not take hold of people. Yeah. And so like, you know, we have

**01:31:35** been through that specific thing with this product of like, if people don't want this, or if this

**01:31:40** doesn't work, or if people don't like it, it calls into question if we're ever going to be more than

**01:31:46** the company that sells the theme system journal, which is totally fine, but we have higher aspirations

**01:31:52** than just to be like a one product company. And so that the psychic notepad was I think that the

**01:31:58** proof of concept of like, can we do more than just the journal and it be a success. And that ended up

**01:32:06** going great. And we're very, very, very happy with the way it launched. And but now we're back here

**01:32:10** again, which is like, it's slightly different, but in just that like we tied up our money and

**01:32:15** start into this product again. And we need to hope that it will take hold the way the journal did.

**01:32:22** When shown to the CGP Grey YouTube audience. Yeah, I guess I guess as the things feel bigger

**01:32:28** to me when you're doubling down. Yeah, we were concerned about like, if Sidekick hadn't done

**01:32:35** well, it would mean that like we were doing something wrong with modeling, what does the

**01:32:41** audience potentially want? Like, what is the market potentially interested in? And that that

**01:32:46** would have been bad news of like, oh, we guessed wrong, which would have a bunch of other kinds of

**01:32:53** implications about what other products do we try or what other things do we do? But yeah, it's just,

**01:32:59** it's the feeling of like, okay, but now we're going to take all of the business capital and double

**01:33:05** down on one thing. That feels just like very breathtaking to me. And I guess I just want to

**01:33:13** correct you because like, I don't want to have to deal with the MBAs in my email. We have not taken

**01:33:18** all of our capital and put it on one product. We have just taken the majority of our available cash

**01:33:24** that we had set aside for any type of product. When we have paused something else that we were

**01:33:30** hoping to do this year and reallocated all of our potential restock funds into this. Yeah, if this

**01:33:37** doesn't sell Cortex brand still has some money, but like, I just like, I know what you mean. And

**01:33:43** I think there'll be people that know what you mean. But like, I want to state it so we don't be like,

**01:33:47** actually, you shouldn't take all of your money and put it on product. So companies go bankrupt.

**01:33:52** Like, no, I know. That is very fair to say because internet. But yes, it's like when I say that,

**01:33:57** I mean, all of the like unspoken for capital, right? That's that's basically what it means.

**01:34:03** Yes, we have bills and things. It's like, you're not a lunatic and say like, oh,

**01:34:08** we'll just really think about it this way. It's like, no, no, no. It's all of the

**01:34:11** available capital as is the thing that we're doing on this. And we have plans, right? Like,

**01:34:17** there is an item of clothing that will return imminently that will help right with that with

**01:34:24** this. Like, it's all part of our like end of year plan. But again, it's like, gotta get that ready.

**01:34:29** Right? That's like a big thing coming up. And like a lot of expectations sitting on that,

**01:34:33** because it usually does really well for us. And we hope that it will again, you know, it's like,

**01:34:37** all of these things are like building and building. Yeah, yeah, it's a lot right now.

**01:34:42** I felt really bad because I messaged you the other day, I can't even remember what it was.

**01:34:45** But I asked you some questions about like, hey, for this thing, I thought we made a decision about

**01:34:49** this. And like, when is this going to happen? And you wrote back of like, dude, we've got two major

**01:34:55** things that need to happen before we even think about rolling it down. It's like, yep, I'm sorry,

**01:35:00** like, let me back away from the keyboard. It's like, I just did the terrible thing of like a

**01:35:05** thought casually popped into my head, and I just messaged it to you. And I was like, Oh, no, Mike is

**01:35:12** Atlas over here. Don't just like be randomly throwing some ideas in his direction about stuff.

**01:35:17** It's like, there's a queue of very important things that are happening in a very particular order.

**01:35:23** I'm definitely aware of that right now. Like that I know I'm doing that that people that I work with

**01:35:29** asking me about things, and I'm answering them. But I am very aware of the fact that my answers

**01:35:38** may be giving away my feelings in a way that I kind of don't want. But you sometimes can't help,

**01:35:45** right? Right. It's kind of like, yeah, I know, like, I know, right? Like, trust me, I know,

**01:35:50** as well. But like, there's there's six plates over there that have got to keep moving. And I've got

**01:35:56** to put my effort into that. But like, we'll put this one on the counter and it can go up, maybe

**01:36:02** in three to four months from now. Yeah, your response was nothing out of line. But it's like,

**01:36:06** I totally realized like, Oh, right. Like, I know that feeling like I've done that to people was

**01:36:13** like, I just did the thing to bike. So I'm just gonna like back away real slow. And for the next

**01:36:18** few months, I'm going to try to practice thinking before I press enter when something comes into my

**01:36:24** head about the business is like, does this really need to be sent as a message right now? Is this

**01:36:30** relevant to the top two projects that are the next two projects? If the answer is no, like, I'm just

**01:36:36** going to keep it in my own system. And this will float back up in January, right? When we're on the

**01:36:42** other side of all of this. This is kind of a weird topic to talk about on the show, because I usually

**01:36:47** feel like something that I try and do and I think we try and do is like we talk about a thing and

**01:36:53** then talk about what is the resolution to that? Like, what is the path? Or like, what have we

**01:36:58** learned? But I just don't really feel like I have an end to this. It's just like, hey, I'm feeling

**01:37:03** like this, but there's not really and there isn't, there's no end. It's just like, this is just it

**01:37:10** right now. Yeah, I know what you mean. Because I'm very aware of again, I always want to be trying to

**01:37:17** communicate actionable things in the conversations, which often means you talk about things in

**01:37:25** retrospect for here is a problem, here's how I solved it, right? This room is too warm, so I made

**01:37:32** a new product which will fix this going forward into the future, right? Like, you know, here's a

**01:37:36** thing and here's what we can do about it. But I think this is just a real insight into an like,

**01:37:43** in the moment feeling of, oh, no, a really busy time is coming up. And what is the action about

**01:37:55** that? There really isn't any action. I mean, like, just for me, I have so much less to do than you

**01:38:02** have to do. But even for me, it's like, why am I recording this from a hotel room right now?

**01:38:06** Because I've got to shut out everything else in my life to try to finish the things that I need to

**01:38:10** finish before the end of the year. But that's about it. Like, that's what I'm doing. And the

**01:38:15** rest of it is just, we've got to get through this. And we will know in a couple of months,

**01:38:22** how these decisions have gone and how things work out. But you're hearing us talk about this before,

**01:38:28** right? Like right before everything really kicks off in September. And there isn't like a lesson,

**01:38:36** it's just, oh, when you have a lot going on, it can be really stress inducing in a non actionable

**01:38:44** sort of way, you just have a background level of like, oh, boy, is there a lot to do? And I've

**01:38:50** got to get working on this. It's like, I'm very aware of like, this is a conversation we have before,

**01:38:57** where like, I need to ask of you the thing that you will like less in your life and have built

**01:39:04** for multiple years to not ever have to deal with anyone giving you a deadline. But like,

**01:39:13** you've got a deadline, like there is a time in which this video needs to be ready so that we're

**01:39:20** able to just, when the stock arrives, we can put the video out and give us enough time before the

**01:39:28** next thing before the end of the year that we need to deal with. And so like, this is months away,

**01:39:34** from now, because as we said before, it takes like, I don't know, it's like, about 12 weeks for

**01:39:41** them to be made, and then a few weeks for them to arrive. So you kind of like 1415 weeks, maybe a

**01:39:46** little bit more depending on the fact that what time of the year they'll be shipping out on.

**01:39:50** But there is a time in which you need to be done. And like, I don't feel comfortable with the fact

**01:39:59** that I have to ask that of you. Because I know, but I just I know that like, what I am asking you

**01:40:07** to do is something I know you don't want. That is just a complicated thing. In a personal relationship

**01:40:14** and in a business relationship is like, not only do I have to ask you to produce a video on a

**01:40:20** timeline, I also need you to do a good job, right? Like, you know what I mean? Like, so it's a very

**01:40:27** hard thing to balance. You could just do one tomorrow. It's probably not going to be any good,

**01:40:33** right? So it's like, that it's it's complicated. The other thing is, from my perspective,

**01:40:39** I will do it if it's necessary. But I really strongly prefer not to have a what I think of

**01:40:45** as like a promo video, or it's like I'm promoting something just appear in the middle of nowhere,

**01:40:51** right? Where it's like, Oh, there hasn't been a real video, and then a product video shows up,

**01:40:55** I really want to try to avoid that. So it means up like there's a knock on effect here of I rarely

**01:41:02** do this, but I have scheduled for like, okay, then it has this knock on implication of like,

**01:41:09** what are the next four projects? And like, what's happening in what order for a couple of things

**01:41:16** related to the end of the year? I'm unusually scheduled in a way that I don't normally do.

**01:41:22** But this, from my perspective is also the thing of when we started to do Cortex brand together,

**01:41:28** I knew like I am signing up for this. This is the nature of just working with other people is

**01:41:35** sometimes you're going to have to do things that you don't necessarily want to do. Like, this is

**01:41:41** so minor about having a deadline. But still, like the reason I did that is like, I think, and it's

**01:41:47** really borne out over the years like Cortex brand is totally worth this. Like this makes sense. And

**01:41:54** there are ways in which by working with other people, you can get way more done than if you're

**01:42:00** just working on your own. But it does mean like, you don't get to have absolutely everything go

**01:42:06** like just perfectly and only the way that you want it to go. Yeah, it's like these days,

**01:42:10** it's unrealistic for me to send you a message and wait for three weeks for a reply. Like,

**01:42:15** a lot of the time, it just it just can't work like that. And I can tell that you're aware of that,

**01:42:20** right? Because the frequency in which you respond to my messages has changed a lot in the last year

**01:42:24** or so. Like, we have to have more meetings, we have to have more phone calls, like things that

**01:42:29** maybe neither of us would naturally want to add more of any of this stuff into our lives. But like,

**01:42:36** there are practicalities of running a business, and you have to do them having in person meetings

**01:42:42** with accountants and business advisors and going over corporate structures and all of these kinds

**01:42:46** of things. It's like, yep, here we are. We do it all these things. Contracts and insurance and

**01:42:52** all kinds of fun stuff. Yeah, but I mean, look, anytime I might be even slightly tempted to feel

**01:43:01** badly about my situation, I'll just think about your situation and then go, oh, right. Once again,

**01:43:07** Mike's job would kill me. Happy to do that for you.
