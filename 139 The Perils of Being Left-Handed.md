# Cortex - 139: The Perils of Being Left-Handed
**00:00:00** We just need to get right into it. Thank you Cortexons for making Sidekick Notepad our best product launch yet.

**00:00:07** We have a lot of stuff that we want to talk about today. We've got lots of topics. We're going to do some Ask Cortex. We've got a whole bunch of things.

**00:00:14** But we need to follow up on this a little bit. The last few weeks have been unbelievable, really.

**00:00:21** It's felt wild to me.

**00:00:23** The only rival for it was the first video you put up about the journal because we didn't know what that would do at all.

**00:00:31** And it sold us out immediately. Because then when you did the second one, we were a bit more prepared.

**00:00:37** But this was like we didn't have no idea what to truly expect for the Sidekick Notepad.

**00:00:43** Like how people would react if people would be able to get it. And I think I feel very confident in saying that yes.

**00:00:50** We ordered a very large amount. We ordered an amount that if we sold it in a year, we'd be happy.

**00:00:58** And we've sold 50 percent of it already. We sold thousands of Sidekick Notepads.

**00:01:03** Yeah. It was just unbelievable. It's really shocking. The behind the scenes of this is that like this product's life.

**00:01:10** I have been the doubter and you have been the believer. And the launch just really showed that hashtag Mike was right.

**00:01:19** Honestly, the best thing that has happened is how many people have contacted me to just tell me that they love how good it feels like the quality of the product.

**00:01:30** Because that was what I really hoped that people would take away from it. That when they use it, they would understand what we were trying to get across.

**00:01:38** And that this is a very high quality product that feels at home on your desk along with anything else that you might choose to put on it.

**00:01:46** I think maybe one of the things I didn't touch on last time about that quality aspect was we are asking you to have this visible on your desk always.

**00:01:58** So it has to be high quality. It has to fit in with anything else that you might choose to put on your desk.

**00:02:04** And it has to have a home there where you're happy to have it there because it's nice to touch and feel and use.

**00:02:10** And the experience is good. If it's crappy or if it's we're cutting corners rather than the beautiful rounded corners, then it doesn't have its place.

**00:02:19** That's a manufacturing pun.

**00:02:21** Oh, got a lot of those now. I felt so much pressure. This felt like the difficult second album kind of thing.

**00:02:30** We had a great success and now we're coming out of our second album and it's in a different style.

**00:02:36** And are people going to get it? They're going to like it? And I feel very happy to say that, yes, they do.

**00:02:42** The other thing that I wanted to mention, which I couldn't believe, is how well people reacted to my video, which I did have out before the episode published.

**00:02:49** You did. I was very proud of you. I also extremely doubted that it would happen, but I was very proud of you for actually getting out.

**00:02:56** Yes, that was great. And people seem to really like it, which also I just I just felt so good.

**00:03:01** Like that we I mean, what is it at now? Is it like over forty five thousand views or something? I can't believe that.

**00:03:07** Yeah, I just checked the stats on it. And again, this like just goes along with how well the launch did.

**00:03:14** You know, it's been out not a long time, but it's already in the top 15 percent of all of the videos we've ever released on the channel.

**00:03:23** Like it's crazy how well that promo video did. So you should feel very pleased about it because looking through it, it's clear like, oh,

**00:03:30** the algorithm is actually recommending it to people like much more than we would have expected for something like this.

**00:03:35** So it's it's really well made and it's done like a great job showing people how does this actually look and how does this actually like work on your desk?

**00:03:46** The perils of being left handed, though, man. I mean, Mike, being left handed, it comes with many disadvantages.

**00:03:53** And there is one that we didn't really quite expect. But yes, having our chief product designer be left handed, I think is an asset in all ways.

**00:04:07** But we now know that the answer is it's an asset in all ways, except one, which is actually demoing the use of the products he has made.

**00:04:18** There was a just like a lot of people and I understand this right where they're like, either something seemed wrong or they thought that the sidekick notepad was somehow made for left handed people.

**00:04:31** Yeah, it's not like I could confirm to you. It's there is no it's actually part of the reason it's designed the way that it is like with the tearing off from the top.

**00:04:42** So like it is ambidextrous in that way, like left hand, right hand, it doesn't matter the layout.

**00:04:47** I don't think it makes any difference. It's really comfortable to use. I understand how if you're right handed, like most people are, you could look at me as a left handed person to be like, well, that's weird.

**00:04:56** So, Gray, I am now trying to not learn how to write right handed, but I've already started doing this.

**00:05:04** Like I've been posting more like reels and stuff and like videos, photos on our Instagram account at Cortex brand.

**00:05:11** And I posted my first one the other day where I am ticking items off with my right hand.

**00:05:17** Yes, right. So you're faking it.

**00:05:19** Got to fake it now. But I do get it, though, right? Like if you're right handed, like most people, when you see me as a left handed person using it, especially the way that I write is weird.

**00:05:29** The way that I grew up a pen is even for left handed people abnormal. It's called overhooking is the way that I write.

**00:05:35** It made it just look strange and you just assume like something odd is going on.

**00:05:38** So I'm going to learn how to underline things and tick things off my right hand. Fake it till I make it.

**00:05:44** Yeah. Or just write the last three letters of a sentence right handed. You don't need to go all in, but you need to be able to fake like a couple of letters.

**00:05:51** Right. And then then it looks good on camera.

**00:05:53** That's harder than you think. Like I don't think you ever.

**00:05:56** Well, I mean, I've been trying this. It does. It still looks really weird because I can't do it right.

**00:06:02** So the other thing is and something that I will do in the future, right, is have people that are not me.

**00:06:07** Yes. But like with this video, this was the only way it could be like there was no time for me to bring in a ringer.

**00:06:15** No, no, of course, of course. This had to be done by you. It wouldn't have happened any other way.

**00:06:20** But like we discussed last time, you learn things as you do these rollouts and as you like add each additional piece.

**00:06:27** And for me, this was this was kind of fascinating because I had the same reaction when I first watched the video.

**00:06:32** I was like, oh, something seems just like a little bit weird.

**00:06:34** And I was trying to analyze all the comments. It's like, oh, Mike, being left handed is just throwing people.

**00:06:40** Well, you could say like, oh, that's not a big deal. But this is where it's like, oh, you know, it's the year of being serious.

**00:06:45** It's like if we're being serious about things, it actually is a big deal because lefties are used to seeing things done by righties all the time.

**00:06:55** Righties are not. And righties are the vast majority of the market.

**00:06:59** And so it's like, oh, no, this video can't have a moment of hesitation for the default buyer who is right handed.

**00:07:09** And yeah, like it kind of took us a little while to figure out what was going on where people were like, oh, I hope he makes a right handed version.

**00:07:15** What?

**00:07:18** It's just so funny to me, like, oh, I'll look forward to the right handed version.

**00:07:22** It's like, no, it's just a piece of paper. It doesn't make a difference.

**00:07:26** Like it is. It's not it's not a symmetrical piece of paper, but it's very close.

**00:07:32** So it's very it's like it's just so funny. Like, oh, this nearly symmetrical object, I hope they make it flipped.

**00:07:38** Like, what? Why?

**00:07:39** That's my highlight of unexpected learning from launch of Sidekick Notepad was was that.

**00:07:47** Well, that's not mine.

**00:07:48** What's yours? What's yours?

**00:07:49** I don't know if you knew, but our notepad can help you see into the future.

**00:07:53** It is the psychic notepad.

**00:07:57** I don't know what happened here.

**00:07:58** This I was tipped off by this.

**00:07:59** So the thing we're talking about a bunch of people here, when me and Grace say, I think me especially, but it is both of us.

**00:08:05** While our product is called the Sidekick Notepad, people hear psychic notepad.

**00:08:12** Yeah.

**00:08:13** My first inclination to this was I made a video during our soft launch period on Instagram

**00:08:20** and the automatic captions that it generates said psychic notepad.

**00:08:25** Oh, right.

**00:08:27** And so I edited it. And then in the video, I went and rerecorded a bunch of lines.

**00:08:33** We did some ADR work.

**00:08:34** I did some ADR work indeed, where I make sure to hit the consonants, right? Sidekick notepad, Sidekick notepad.

**00:08:44** But when me and you were just talking about it freely on the show, we're dropping that D all over the place.

**00:08:50** Yeah, easily, easily.

**00:08:51** And so it sounds like psychic notepad.

**00:08:54** I even bought psychic notepad.com in anticipation of this.

**00:08:58** Now I feel like I'm hearing D's where they're aren't, right?

**00:09:00** Because language is you don't realize how much your brain is filling in the actual details of what a person is saying.

**00:09:07** I still say you work professionally in audio and you realize how sloppy language actually is.

**00:09:11** So just to be clear here, you bought psychic notepad.com just in case.

**00:09:17** Just in case.

**00:09:19** But this product is called the Sidekick Notepad.

**00:09:23** One last thing that I want to mention about it that I also really liked is just a fun to know.

**00:09:28** But we have received some emails about Sidekick Notepad being used in high security environments.

**00:09:37** Companies, governments.

**00:09:40** I have been to conferences where this is the case.

**00:09:42** If secure things are being discussed, if people there are very serious about security, you have meetings where it's like no computers.

**00:09:51** And of course, no computers means no phones, no nothing.

**00:09:56** All you can bring in is paper and a pen.

**00:10:00** And we have received confirmation of some very interesting locations where it has been used.

**00:10:08** And I find this just delightful.

**00:10:11** And and for me, I really love this because it hits on the other side of what Sidekick Notepad can do is it's not just the in front of your computer thing.

**00:10:21** It's like, no, no, you're going into a meeting.

**00:10:24** And the quality is there to kind of signal like I'm serious about this meeting.

**00:10:30** Right. Like I'm sitting down.

**00:10:32** I have this thing.

**00:10:33** It has a nice cover.

**00:10:34** It's horizontal, little eye catching, but not too flashing.

**00:10:37** Right. Flip over the cover.

**00:10:38** You're here to take notes like you're getting things done while we can't say where these high security environments are.

**00:10:45** Just know Sidekick Notepad, protecting the freedom of everyone worldwide.

**00:10:54** It's so it's so satisfying to know where is your product actually being used on my side.

**00:11:00** I'll say some of the more phones have been tech companies where they have like secrecy.

**00:11:04** So they're not allowed these devices in the rooms.

**00:11:07** And I've heard people similarly who are using Sidekick Notepad in those environments because they're allowed to.

**00:11:12** And in some instances, you're not allowed to take the paper out with you, which is even better for our product.

**00:11:17** You just tear the page out, leave it behind.

**00:11:19** Oh, of course.

**00:11:20** I didn't even think about it.

**00:11:22** You put it in the secrecy shredder at the side of the room.

**00:11:24** Yes, actually, this is what I've heard about.

**00:11:27** That's a thing that really exists.

**00:11:28** And thank you so much to everyone that bought one.

**00:11:30** You can go to cortexbrand.com and pick one up.

**00:11:33** This has been an incredible time for both of us here at Cortex Brand.

**00:11:37** And it's been a wonderful validation of what we're trying to achieve.

**00:11:40** And so thank you to everybody that has bought one.

**00:11:43** And I genuinely hope that you love it and use it and want more.

**00:11:48** So a number of months ago, a number of episodes ago,

**00:11:51** you mentioned that you would help get me set up with Obsidian if I wanted it.

**00:11:56** I did.

**00:11:56** I made that very generous offer.

**00:11:58** And then you came over to my new house.

**00:12:00** Unannounced to help you with Obsidian.

**00:12:03** Yes, you just showed up banging on the window shouting Obsidian for the laptop.

**00:12:08** So I finally let you in and I got the tour that I needed.

**00:12:12** And I have now been using Obsidian for a couple of months, I think.

**00:12:16** For funny reasons, I have seen you use Obsidian in VR,

**00:12:20** which is the foreshadowing for a thing later.

**00:12:22** Oh, yes.

**00:12:24** Oh, yes.

**00:12:24** Yes.

**00:12:25** So I've seen you use it, but since I helped set you up with it,

**00:12:29** I haven't heard like a peep about what you think about it.

**00:12:33** So I've been kind of like, what's going on?

**00:12:36** What does Mike think?

**00:12:37** And are you going to tell me now?

**00:12:38** What do you think of Obsidian?

**00:12:40** It's game changing.

**00:12:41** Oh, yeah.

**00:12:41** It's unbelievable.

**00:12:43** So what I will say is I've had to change some of my processes a little bit.

**00:12:48** And what I'm using Obsidian for is what I was using craft for previously,

**00:12:52** which is a place to keep all of my notes and files and stuff for Cortex brand.

**00:12:58** And I'd mentioned previously that mixed media was something that I enjoyed.

**00:13:03** Now, realistically, Obsidian is very text focused.

**00:13:08** I think if I had a criticism, I wish that they handled images better.

**00:13:12** Like, I don't think the way the images are handled is that great.

**00:13:14** They kind of show up as individual files and then you can add them to notes.

**00:13:18** And I wish there was a way to just hide those individual files from the file structure of like

**00:13:24** this image, this image, this image.

**00:13:26** But nevertheless, I do use this system mostly for text.

**00:13:32** And so it's a lot of note taking, a lot of writing of like descriptions and market and copy.

**00:13:38** It's for like our meet and notes that we have, all that kind of stuff.

**00:13:42** So I'm doing a lot of that and the way in which they make it so simple to have like multiple

**00:13:49** notes open side by side and you can do those splits.

**00:13:52** That's all great.

**00:13:53** But the reason I am 100% sold on this is the canvas feature.

**00:13:58** So for me, in getting the Sidekick notepad ready for launch,

**00:14:02** I set up a canvas where I have logistics information, I have feedback information,

**00:14:09** and then I have like five marketing notes that are all individual notes

**00:14:14** that are all in one little area of the canvas and I'm able to actively edit them all while in the

**00:14:21** canvas without ever leaving that view.

**00:14:24** So what I was doing was, all right, I want to make a product description.

**00:14:27** Well, I can take this line from here and this line from here and put them together and make edits.

**00:14:32** And like, it was so good.

**00:14:35** Like the canvas feature is so good.

**00:14:37** And again, as a refresher, you create this like board where you can have a bunch of notes,

**00:14:43** all visible at once, along with media and you can link them together in like kind of like a mind

**00:14:49** mappy style.

**00:14:50** Honestly, it's hard to explain because I've never seen anything like this before

**00:14:54** for this kind of note taking.

**00:14:58** And for me, it's like as a way for me to do this kind of work,

**00:15:04** it makes so much more sense than jumping from note to note to note, or even in some cases,

**00:15:08** having a split screen of notes, just having them all living in this one place and they're all active.

**00:15:13** Amazing.

**00:15:14** Throughout the process of getting psychic notepad ready, this was just game changing for me in

**00:15:21** how in control I felt of things.

**00:15:24** Like something that I would find happening a lot is I would make some notes and then forget that

**00:15:28** I made them and then make another note.

**00:15:30** Right?

**00:15:32** And this way I could have all of my notes that were related to psychic notepad marketing,

**00:15:36** all visible at once, like that, which is what I was doing.

**00:15:39** And it just meant that I wasn't duplicating work so much.

**00:15:43** Okay, so you were using it just like a huge whiteboard in an office that everything you were going

**00:15:50** to write down, you're just you're putting it on here and it's either going to go into one of the

**00:15:55** existing notes or you're putting it as a new note on top of there.

**00:15:59** Like to try and maybe make it like completely clear what I was doing.

**00:16:03** Like I was keeping this long note for like nearly two years of what is the story of this product?

**00:16:11** Right?

**00:16:11** So how do you explain it to somebody every time I had like some idea about where it could be used,

**00:16:17** I would write them all down in there.

**00:16:19** So I had this really long list of bullet points.

**00:16:23** So then when it came to writing the script for the video, writing the product descriptions,

**00:16:28** writing some short descriptions for social media, all I was doing is to have this one thing open,

**00:16:33** and I could duplicate or copy and paste from that one area.

**00:16:36** So like it was that was like a bank of stuff.

**00:16:39** And I was able to pull from that.

**00:16:40** But then also having say, the marketing lines one open and the marketing story open,

**00:16:46** made it really easy for me to then craft the product description because I had some short lines

**00:16:51** and I had some longer lines or just some general ideas.

**00:16:54** And it just made it really easy for me to pull all of that stuff together because I could visually

**00:16:58** see it all where previously, like when I was in craft, because when I moved from craft to obsidian,

**00:17:04** and it was really easy to do that, I could export all my notes into files and then just bring them

**00:17:09** all in.

**00:17:10** Oh, wow.

**00:17:10** I'm surprised to hear it was.

**00:17:11** It was fantastic how easy it was.

**00:17:13** That's that's shocking.

**00:17:14** I know craft has a great export feature.

**00:17:17** And then it basically exported it in a way that obsidian could just read really easily.

**00:17:21** I just had to drag and drop the files into the because I'm using iCloud drive,

**00:17:25** the rare things being stored.

**00:17:27** And so I was able to just drag and drop the folder in from craft.

**00:17:30** And then but then I went through whenever I do a big thing like this,

**00:17:33** like I'm just going to manually look through it all and see if there's anything I do and don't need.

**00:17:36** And I was seeing for like the theme system journal, right?

**00:17:39** I had all of these notes.

**00:17:41** It was like this.

**00:17:41** These are all just duplicates of each other because I'd forgotten that I'd started something

**00:17:45** like this already.

**00:17:46** I'd have like, oh, here's some product descriptions for the journal.

**00:17:49** And then I did it again.

**00:17:51** Like I had multiple things because I was just like, oh, here's an idea.

**00:17:54** I need to do that.

**00:17:55** Where now with the sidekick notepad canvas that I have in obsidian,

**00:17:59** all of these notes are just visible to me.

**00:18:01** I can see the work that I've already done and just makes it really easy.

**00:18:04** It's interesting to hear you say that because you sort of come at an idea in a different way.

**00:18:10** And so this concept of obsidian is a tool that allows you to not accidentally duplicate work.

**00:18:18** It's very interesting to hear that you're using the canvas is that like that totally makes sense of,

**00:18:23** ah, I have a canvas for this topic.

**00:18:26** Everything related to this topic just goes on this thing and I can see it.

**00:18:29** And that dramatically reduces duplicate work.

**00:18:31** Like another one that I have that I love is I have separate notes that track the pricing

**00:18:38** of our products.

**00:18:40** So over time, each shipment, what it cost in production and shipping and sales and then all

**00:18:46** that kind of stuff.

**00:18:47** I have a canvas that brings together all of those notes

**00:18:51** so I can compare them against each other when I'm looking at like,

**00:18:54** well, the price is going to be like, what do I expect shipping's going to be?

**00:18:57** And I have it all in one place rather than going back between one or the other.

**00:19:02** But also I don't want one note where all these things exist.

**00:19:05** I want them to be separate.

**00:19:06** Like I have one for each product and but this is a way for me to bring in notes that live in

**00:19:12** different folders in my file structure into just one view without needing to create one master

**00:19:18** note for them all, which I don't want to do.

**00:19:19** What I was just thinking there is like, I don't use the canvas feature in the way that you do,

**00:19:24** but I'm still it's the same concept of.

**00:19:28** Oh, if I'm going to type absolutely anything, the first thing I'm doing is I am doing a little

**00:19:35** command where you can like search through all of your notes and I just start typing whatever

**00:19:38** the topic is as like, oh, it instantly finds like, is there an existing note on this thing?

**00:19:45** Boom, you just go to it and start typing.

**00:19:47** And that is my like, as long as I know everything that I work with that has to do with words

**00:19:53** exists in this system, that's the same way to like not accidentally do the thing where you've

**00:19:59** written, you know, like over the space of a year, you've written the same note four times

**00:20:03** because you're having that like, I think it's such an important mental framework shift when using a

**00:20:10** computer, this concept of like search first in terms of like using an actual built in search tool,

**00:20:17** like spotlight, or you're searching within this app and then go to make the thing.

**00:20:21** Don't try to find it, but it's very hard to get into that mindset.

**00:20:26** I'm struggling with that.

**00:20:27** But like, but that's why I think what you've done with the canvas is really interesting.

**00:20:31** It's solving the same problem because you just know, oh, okay, I might not be doing search first

**00:20:38** just as a default, but at the very least, this canvas, I should be able to physically see all

**00:20:44** of these notes. And the thing that's really nice and, you know, for listeners that's different about

**00:20:48** just like a folder with a bunch of notes is that you see the contents of the notes at the same time.

**00:20:54** To me, this is the big advantage with Obsidian is the, like the raw information density that you can

**00:21:01** have on the screen. How much can you see at once that you can also easily navigate between and work

**00:21:08** with and like cut copy paste across a bunch of different things. So I think that's interesting.

**00:21:12** Like your canvas use is a kind of pseudo search first mindset, but it works.

**00:21:16** Like it sounds like it's totally working.

**00:21:18** Yeah. Like I'm trying to do that thing that you really recommended of like search for notes first.

**00:21:23** What I'm realizing is I'm not good at that. Like I know what I'm looking for, but I sometimes

**00:21:31** fail to remember what I called the note. So like I'm struggling with this like naming structure

**00:21:38** thing in my brain.

**00:21:39** Okay. So let me, let me tell you the pro tip here. Don't try to have a naming structure,

**00:21:43** right? Like what I do is if you search for something and you can't find it and you're

**00:21:47** like, Oh God, what did I call that thing? And then eventually you're able to bring it up,

**00:21:51** right? Cause you can remember a sentence inside of it. Like you can find it in various ways,

**00:21:56** just add whatever the word was that you first searched for to the title.

**00:22:01** Yeah.

**00:22:01** Just do it immediately. And so I have some wacky file names where it's like, Oh,

**00:22:06** this is the actual name of the thing, but my brain just always searches for this word.

**00:22:11** So we just put that word on the title as well. You should really think of the titles as this

**00:22:16** is just a sequence of tags and some of those tags happen to be unique in the system. But it's like,

**00:22:22** it's fast enough at searching that, that like, I just find whenever you have that,

**00:22:26** I didn't find it instantly. Make a note of the word that you just searched for,

**00:22:30** find it and add that word to the title of the actual document. And that,

**00:22:34** that wildly improves things because you're not fighting against yourself.

**00:22:37** So I would say like in this system that I had in craft and now I'm having an obsidian,

**00:22:44** I would say like about 75% of the time, all I need is to be able to enter text and edit text.

**00:22:51** Outside of that, I was using tables and I was using like imagery, like either like to save images

**00:22:57** or to make some sketches and have them in a note.

**00:22:59** Okay. Wait, before you, before you go any further, because I want to,

**00:23:02** I want to flag up something here. So you have the file browser open when you're using obsidian.

**00:23:06** And you're saying that you, you don't like what, that the images clutter up the file browser.

**00:23:12** Is that what you were saying? Yeah. So I still have a folder view on the side, right? So every

**00:23:18** file, every note that I have just gets saved into a folder. Right. Cause that's just the way that my

**00:23:23** brain works. And so for example, I have a folder called psychic notepad and it has a bunch of notes

**00:23:28** in it, but at the top of the view, there's like file name dot assets. And then there's a bunch of

**00:23:35** images that instead saved inside of that. I have a note called concept, right? Which is when I was

**00:23:41** originally coming up with the concept and I had a bunch of drawings and photos and stuff. So that's

**00:23:46** a note that I have, it's called concept, but also in the sidekick notepad folder, there is like a

**00:23:53** sub folder called concept dot assets, which has saved individually all of the images that are

**00:24:00** inside of the note. Okay. So I think there's a solution to what you're doing, which is there is

**00:24:06** an option. I will send you a screenshot, which tells obsidian when I add an attachment or an

**00:24:15** add an image or a PDF or anything, don't put it where I'm working. Either put it in a sub folder

**00:24:22** where I'm working. So I have everything just be like, Hey, if I add an image, it goes into a sub

**00:24:28** folder just called attachments in this little folder, or you can set a global attachment folder

**00:24:33** for like just every, just dump everything in there and don't worry about it. But there is an answer

**00:24:37** to this. Like you shouldn't be looking at the file names for image files. Once you've added them to a

**00:24:44** document, those should basically become invisible to you. Well, that would help. I think I might

**00:24:48** have found the setting, which is called default location for new attachments. Yes, that's correct.

**00:24:54** That's the one and it's set for me as same folder as current file. So that is what you do not want.

**00:25:00** Right? So you want to like I think in the folder specified below. Yeah. So you can either have one

**00:25:05** global one or I have it set as like in a sub folder under the current folder. And I just give that the

**00:25:11** name attachments. Yeah, I need to do that. But then can I move the existing ones or is it going to

**00:25:16** break everything? As long as you do it in the file browser and obsidian, it'll update the links

**00:25:22** everywhere. It's no problem. I've done this with a ton of stuff. Okay. So it is no issue at all.

**00:25:27** Well, that's going to fix one problem completely then the images problem, because I just didn't

**00:25:31** like that it was cluttering everything. And I like that. I just need them all to be saved in one little

**00:25:35** folder and then obsidian can do whatever it wants with them. Right. It doesn't particularly bother me

**00:25:40** then. I mean, here's my feeling about this mic is when you get good enough at obsidian, you won't

**00:25:46** even have to do any of this anymore. Yeah. Because the file browser is just a crutch, right? For,

**00:25:52** oh, I want to know where things are going. I love folders though. I love organization of things.

**00:25:58** No, don't get me wrong. I've got like tons and tons and tons of folders in my system,

**00:26:02** but while you're working, having the file navigator open, yeah, it's a crutch. Oh, right. That's what

**00:26:10** I'm saying. Yeah. So I have it like, ooh, nicely organize all of my attachments in a little sub

**00:26:15** folder, but I don't even really need to do that in any way. Yeah. Okay. Because like I'm never

**00:26:20** really looking at the navigation. That makes sense. The other thing that I use the system a lot for

**00:26:25** is tables. See now this, there is no solution. I'm just using numbers now. There are plugins.

**00:26:31** And so one of the really cool things about obsidian that I've yet to super dive into is the

**00:26:35** plugins and I've installed a bunch of plugins. The community is awesome. For me, the themes,

**00:26:40** like I love the themes I'm using, I think the minimal theme, which I customized with some fonts

**00:26:46** of my own, which I'm really happy about. That took a little bit of time to work out, but I got it in

**00:26:51** the end. Yeah. I'm using the minimal theme in the dark mode. And I love how clean it is. Like,

**00:26:57** yeah, one of the things that always scared me about obsidian is I just didn't like the way it

**00:27:00** looked, but some of the themes are just really simple, really beautiful, which is what I want.

**00:27:04** And I just use a couple of typefaces. I use some of Apple's typefaces. So I'm using

**00:27:09** San Francisco rounded and they also have a serif typeface called New York. And I adore that

**00:27:15** typeface. So I use that as like, that's what all the file structure is in, it's is in New York.

**00:27:20** And then all of the actual fonts are in San Francisco rounded. I just like those two fonts

**00:27:24** a lot. So just go for it and use those. And you can, I even found the like, really complicated way

**00:27:30** to get it to work on iOS as well. But I did it. It's like, Oh, wow. Yeah. It's like a whole thing.

**00:27:35** You need like, I think I'll try and find the instructions that I used and I'll put them in

**00:27:42** the show notes, but it's like you need like an app that can install it and install the profile.

**00:27:46** And it's like a whole thing that you can make it work. So I've just moved to numbers. And honestly,

**00:27:51** I'm happier because numbers is better than craft was like calculations and how easy it is to do

**00:27:56** that stuff. And now I'll be able to get something from these, which I always kind of wanted, which

**00:28:01** is to build charts out of these numbers. But I always kind of just told myself like, ah,

**00:28:05** you don't need it because it was impossible for me to do in craft. But now I have all of like,

**00:28:09** it's just recordings of sales figures and stuff. And so now I'll actually be able to build some

**00:28:13** charts out of these numbers. So ultimately, I'll be happier with doing it this way.

**00:28:17** Yeah. My rule of thumb is you can do tables in Obsidian, but they're not great. And you can do

**00:28:23** calculations in tables in Obsidian. And that's extra not great. Like it's not the tool for this.

**00:28:29** My advice to anyone is if you want to do or think you may ever want to do anything more

**00:28:37** complicated than adding up a single column or row of numbers, do not do this in Obsidian.

**00:28:43** I will actually go a step further because I didn't finish. I realized now I didn't finish

**00:28:47** the thought that I had, which was you can install these plugins, which will give you like markdown

**00:28:52** table support. Yeah. And that's how you're doing it. Markdown tables look nice when you're not

**00:28:57** editing them. When you're editing them, it's a nightmare. Yeah. And it's possible to do

**00:29:01** calculations, but like not for mere mortals. It's so complicated. Like I would say, if you want to

**00:29:10** have a table, do any automatic calculation for you. Don't try and do this in Obsidian.

**00:29:16** Mike's advice is actually probably better. Yeah. I would agree with that. Even if you,

**00:29:21** or perhaps especially if you're thinking, Oh, I have the technical skills to be able to pull

**00:29:26** this off. It's like, no, no, no, don't you, it's not worth it. You will be much more rewarded with

**00:29:31** something like numbers and what you just said, like whatever, whatever. We don't need, we only

**00:29:36** have spreadsheet wars, even though numbers is obviously way more beautiful. Oh, easy.

**00:29:40** Like, you know, numbers is the bell of the ball. No one's arguing that, right? Like it's very, like

**00:29:45** Excel is more powerful. Numbers is prettier. Like that's it. There is no argument to be had there.

**00:29:50** I mean, I will actually argue if Excel really is more powerful. I'm doing some pretty crazy things

**00:29:54** with numbers, but, but yeah, like I use just for the regular formatting, I use the advanced table

**00:30:03** thing in Obsidian, but yeah, you're also, like you said, if you're working with actual numbers at all,

**00:30:09** you want to give yourself the option of, Hey, let me just look at this in a chart and see if it makes

**00:30:14** more sense. And you want to make that real easy to be able to do. So, so yeah, this, this is totally a

**00:30:19** like Obsidian is a great tool, but you always want to use the right tool for the right job.

**00:30:25** And beyond displaying just text in a table, Obsidian is not the tool for that. Like an actual

**00:30:31** spreadsheet is what you should be doing. Spreadsheets. Yeah. This is one of those things where,

**00:30:36** similarly to how I do to craft, I will impress on the developers of Obsidian to make a good way to

**00:30:45** handle basic tables. I think this is an important thing to have. I would love to see them try and do

**00:30:50** something better than Markdown tables. Yeah. It's a tough, it's a tough call. If they, if they were

**00:30:55** going to do something, it would have to be like canvas. It would have to be some layer on top of

**00:31:00** what's actually happening. I think asking to do it in the notes is asking to figure out something

**00:31:05** that's better than Markdown tables to the file. It can look like a Markdown table, but to the user,

**00:31:11** there can be a user interface. Oh, I see what you're saying. Right. I think they should build

**00:31:16** a user interface for Markdown tables, which is seamless within the note, but ultimately it's

**00:31:21** just writing a Markdown table. Okay. Right. Yeah. I see what you're saying. All right. I agree with

**00:31:24** that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That makes sense. I thought you were like, they need to reinvent Markdown

**00:31:29** tables, but better. And I think, oh, within the confines of text, that feels like just an impossible

**00:31:33** task. Yeah. But you can do like just all the basics. It doesn't have to do anything wild,

**00:31:38** but like just the ability to have a table and just having some basic calculation on that table

**00:31:42** of like subtracting a minus thing. They could build a UI for that and it can still just look

**00:31:48** like a Markdown table in the back. Yeah. But anyway, I love Obsidian. Like I get it now. Like

**00:31:54** the thing about Obsidian is I think you need to have a reason first because the app is so daunting

**00:32:01** coming to it. And I think it is their need. And I think that is, I think what they are doing is

**00:32:06** changing that. I think they want to change that to make the app a little easier to onboard. I

**00:32:11** think it's pretty important for them going forward. I would expect, right? And so anyone can use it

**00:32:16** for anything because I think it is really like it is inherently simple, but it looks so scary.

**00:32:23** Especially when you, if you do any Googling about Obsidian, it's too much. Like if you go to YouTube

**00:32:31** and you just type in Obsidian, you'll met with too much, right? Here's how I learned to look after

**00:32:37** a baby using Obsidian. Right. It's just like, no, this is, I just want someone to tell me this is a

**00:32:42** notes app. Yeah. I completely agree. There's a kind of wacky content world around Obsidian,

**00:32:48** which is not helpful for a new user. My personal favorite trope of all of these is,

**00:32:52** Hey, let me show you my mind map thing with a thousand. I was like,

**00:32:56** nobody needs this. This is, this tool is helpful to no one. It just looks cool.

**00:33:00** It's like notion has the same problem, but notion has more like external marketing

**00:33:07** than Obsidian does. So they tell their story a little bit, just like clearly on its own.

**00:33:12** And then you can go and dig in and like, look, just Obsidian is, is coming from a different

**00:33:17** area, right? Like notion took VC Funday, right? Like Obsidian is coming at this from a different

**00:33:23** area. But I think that they can get to it because the app to me now is very approachable. Like

**00:33:30** there's just some, like when you set it up for me, that set up process was too complicated. I think

**00:33:36** like that was pretty daunting to me. Cause it felt like I, they were asking me to make some

**00:33:41** decisions and I didn't know why I needed to make them. Like, where would you like to store your

**00:33:47** vault? It's like, um, I don't know, man. You tell me, you know, that's the kind of thing that is very

**00:33:52** easy to kind of overlook when you're making an app is like, Oh, you realize, you know, this, this

**00:33:58** is like, again, I think about this a lot whenever I'm writing a script is you think about what's the

**00:34:05** first time you've introduced a word and you have to have, have prepared the person to like, to be

**00:34:12** able to understand the new word, if it's a technical word. And this kind of mistake is just so easy to

**00:34:17** make where it's like, Oh, where do you want to put your vault? It's like, Oh, I'm sorry. This is the

**00:34:21** first time I've heard the word vault. Uh, what are you talking about? Like, what is that? I need

**00:34:25** to know what it is to be able to make this decision. And you know, it's like just little

**00:34:31** language smoothings. Like, you know, where do you want to keep all your obsidian files? Like that's

**00:34:34** what they want to know, but there's a technical term that's vault. And even for me as a very

**00:34:40** experienced obsidian user, you saw that because I hadn't set it up in a while. I think we took

**00:34:46** three goes at it. I think it was multiple attempts at setting it up. Yeah. Even for me,

**00:34:54** there was stumbling blocks because it's like, Oh, I want to set this up for Mike in a particular

**00:34:58** way. And it's like, Oh, but I can't quite do this immediately. And because of those stumblings,

**00:35:04** I still felt bad. I left you and I didn't do the main thing that I wanted to do, which I recommend

**00:35:09** for anybody who is going to try obsidian is the first thing you need to do is install that minimum

**00:35:15** theme. Like the minimal theme just calms the whole thing down and gives you options for,

**00:35:23** Oh, I want to tweak it on how it's going to look a little bit. And how it looks a little bit is the

**00:35:29** very first thing anyone coming to a text processor is like going to want to do. Right. Like for user

**00:35:36** onboarding, what do people want? They want colors and they want their fonts and they want them right

**00:35:41** away. And like, that's what this like helps do. And I felt bad because I, because we've gotten

**00:35:47** kind of like, Oh man, that we ran out of time and I was trying to set you up with it. I forgot is

**00:35:51** like, Oh, I have to, I have to flip Mike over to the easy one. And it's like, Oh no, I left him on

**00:35:57** just the standard theme, which is like, it's fine, but it can be easier and it can just look calmer

**00:36:02** and less intimidating. It's the designer of the minimal theme. Stefan Ango, who is now the CEO

**00:36:10** of Obsidian. Oh, I didn't know that. Okay. That makes sense. So Stefan, I've been doing things

**00:36:14** for years in tech and design and product design and stuff. Right. And he was working with them.

**00:36:19** And now as the CEO of the company, I was like, this is what I mean about, I think that they're

**00:36:24** starting to change a little bit in the sense of like, okay, we've built this incredible thing.

**00:36:29** How do we now make it usable and workable for everyone? And so I think this is in the case of

**00:36:35** like, okay, we're bringing in a CEO and turns out it's the guy who made the app look best.

**00:36:44** Stefan set your theme as default, right? Let's just do that. Just do that right now.

**00:36:48** I feel like they're probably going to move in that direction. Right.

**00:36:51** Yes. That does seem quite likely. If that's the way the org,

**00:36:54** obviously going to be like, all right, gang, we need to, we need to tighten this one up.

**00:36:58** Gang. Yeah, exactly. I think that the, like one of the reasons I was pushing this on you and,

**00:37:04** and why I've kind of raved about obsidian since I found it is it's just for the right kind of

**00:37:10** person. This is exactly the tool that they need that will really change things for them.

**00:37:17** But it is hard to get into, but also it has the feature of like some of the things that do make

**00:37:24** it tricky to get into. Like, yes, you can round off the corners, but ultimately the way it's made

**00:37:30** is also why it's the perfect tool for so many things. So it's like, it exists in this, in this

**00:37:36** tricky world. And it always just makes me think of this, this Linux program, Emacs, where it's the

**00:37:40** same thing of like, man, this tool, it's a text-based tool. It can do anything. And it's like, and it's

**00:37:46** just like the right answer to a lot of problems. If you are a certain kind of person working with

**00:37:51** text, this is why I was really pushing it. Like when I, when I heard you talking on upgrade plus

**00:37:56** and you were complaining about like trying to do this kind of thing and it wasn't craft,

**00:38:00** it was Apple's thing, right? Well, what's it called? It's called Freeform? Freeform, yeah.

**00:38:04** Yeah, Freeform. I was like, listening to you in that conversation, I was like, I know that you

**00:38:09** want obsidian. Like, I know this is the answer to your problems, Mike. Like, let me, let me come

**00:38:13** over and knock on your windows and set this up for you and try to walk you through it. So I'm,

**00:38:17** I'm just really happy that it's worked out for you. And I think also now you can understand

**00:38:23** over the years, some of what my complaints have been about with writing apps and why obsidian is

**00:38:29** like such an answer to that. And it's this ability to be like, I've got these three documents on my

**00:38:34** screen. Like, it's like the script is in the center and I have two auxiliary files on either side.

**00:38:39** And the ability to jump in and out of all of those and just like move stuff around.

**00:38:43** It's so good. It's just killer. I've been trying to think about a way to explain

**00:38:49** the difference between obsidian and something like notion or craft. And I feel like the closest

**00:38:55** analogy I can come to, and I'm still not there with it, is like craft notion, they're like

**00:39:01** Swiss army knives. They've got a ton of tools and all of them are good enough and they will get you

**00:39:08** through a thing. But obsidian is like a really good pocket knife. It really should be used for

**00:39:15** just one thing, but you can use it for some other stuff if you want to. You can tie it in a screw

**00:39:19** with it. You'll find a way. You shouldn't, but you can. But for the things that it's supposed to be,

**00:39:24** like text, it's the best. So I'm not settled on that, but it's kind of a way I've been thinking

**00:39:29** about it is don't try and make it do too much, but it can do that one thing so good.

**00:39:36** Yeah. And I even will say I learned something from you with obsidian just in the fact of

**00:39:42** its text. And I also put the asterisk of for certain image problems, it's also really good

**00:39:49** now because of canvas. And I would have just completely ignored the canvas feature if that

**00:39:55** hadn't been the thing that you were attracted to. So I played around with it a little bit to be like,

**00:39:59** oh, this is what Mike wants to use. Like I should just know this a bit before I go over there and

**00:40:02** try to set him up with obsidian. Like trying to learn it with him would be a bad and

**00:40:08** convincing look. Yeah. I don't know. Let me just start doing stuff. You tell me. Yeah. So I, like

**00:40:14** I, because of you, I tried it and like, oh, okay. I see how this works. It was the same thing of,

**00:40:20** oh, I've used a lot of tools like this. This is just much better, but ultimately like, oh,

**00:40:25** my brain doesn't really work like this. I deal with lists of texts. I don't deal with visual

**00:40:29** information like rearranged. But of course, once you have something like that in the back of your

**00:40:34** mind, it's just waiting for the moment that it's useful. And like joke was on me. It turned out

**00:40:39** that the video that I'm currently working on the best of all possible tools to use for it was

**00:40:44** canvas. It's like, I've got 50, 60 images and the whole video is like arranging these in a certain

**00:40:52** way. And I was originally like, oh my God, this is, this is such a pain to write. And I realized,

**00:40:56** oh no, I can just open a canvas. That's half of my screen. So that as I'm going through the script,

**00:41:02** I can keep rearranging the images for how they're going to be displayed in the video. And I was

**00:41:07** like, oh my God, this is great. Like this makes this so much easier and helps visualize what is

**00:41:12** it going to look like as I'm talking through these things. Like what's the order going to happen? So

**00:41:16** I don't think I ever would have done that if you hadn't mentioned that you were interested in

**00:41:20** canvas. So I also have to thank you for letting me help you get it started. No worries.

**00:43:52** to issue for the support of this show and relay FM. We're approaching the end of the first quarter

**00:43:57** of the year. You know what's coming up, Mike? It's the spring equinox. Okay. It's a season

**00:44:04** change. Okay. It's not the first quarter of the year. Spring is okay. You live by the tides and

**00:44:11** I live by the Gregorian calendar. Right? That's the differences within the two of us. But anyway,

**00:44:16** how is the spring equinox period treating you with your yearly theme? All joking aside,

**00:44:21** I do seriously think that the seasons are important because you can see them coming.

**00:44:26** The days get longer and it is a good time to reassess. I mean, every day I look at a calendar,

**00:44:31** like I don't really know. I don't understand that. It's like more definite. No, I just, I disagree.

**00:44:38** I mean, maybe it's just because your relationship with a calendar is very different. My relationship

**00:44:42** with a calendar is the teeny tiny fantastical icon in my menu bar that just says nine,

**00:44:49** 10 or 11. And I very rarely look at the actual full calendar. So I can and frequently do forget

**00:44:57** what month of the year it is. Like I know, you know, I know where we are within the month,

**00:45:01** but it's easy to forget like, wait, is it February or was it January? Just take a look out the window,

**00:45:04** you know what I mean? Look at your sundial and then you'll work it out. But that's just it. Over

**00:45:08** the course of three months, you can see the seasons changing and that's Mike, how you know time is

**00:45:13** passing. Okay. Whatever you say, man. So I do think it's an interesting time to like just assess,

**00:45:20** right? Where are we with themes? Okay. I do always feel like, cause we could check in on themes every

**00:45:25** month if we wanted to, but we don't. And it's too much. Every month is too much. But I do feel like

**00:45:29** earlier in the year is a good check-in point rather than later in the year, because we're still in the

**00:45:35** period of time where it's embedding. And I think it's helpful to take this time period to make sure

**00:45:42** that we're on the right track, because you still got so much left ahead of you that if you've gotten

**00:45:47** off course by March, you want to fix that sooner rather than later. Yeah. That's, that's a good

**00:45:52** point to make that on a graph of the year, I feel like you should be very cognizant of the theme

**00:46:00** at the beginning and it sort of trails off. And then you're more cognizant towards the end of like,

**00:46:06** how much are you paying attention? Cause like you said, you're trying to establish something.

**00:46:10** I love graph of the year. Again, calendars. If there was a way to lay out the seasons with

**00:46:17** some kind of number system. It's really funny. I didn't realize you can't, you know, you can't

**00:46:25** seaweed out, but I drew with my hand the graph, which is when you lay out when is the sun rise

**00:46:33** and set over the course of a year, right? You can do those little solar graphs of how much

**00:46:37** daylight is there. That's what I drew with my hands. And I was like, Oh, I think how, how

**00:46:43** beautiful this inverse symmetry is that the graph of theme cognizance is exactly inverse to the graph

**00:46:49** of the sunlight right over the course of the year. You work inside a lot of the time inside of a just

**00:46:55** pitch black box. That is true. But yeah, the sun, it's not pitch black. I set my hue lights so that

**00:47:02** it's mimicking a Arctic Aurora at very low light. So it's blue and green in here.

**00:47:07** So what you're saying is you're creating your own seasonal environment now,

**00:47:12** which is divorced from the actual season. Yes, that's true. My actual workday is like the

**00:47:17** midnight sun in Antarctica. Yes. That's right. That's what, that's what my actual experience.

**00:47:22** Just have to run the same page.

**00:47:24** I feel like you're, you're needlessly throwing me off track here, Mike, with, with, with your

**00:47:31** calendars and your numbers. So how is the year of work treating you? I was, I was trying to think

**00:47:39** about past years and past themes and I was, I was looking at stuff and I don't think I have

**00:47:46** felt as good about a theme at this point in the year as I do now. I'm just extremely happy about

**00:47:55** how things are going. And for me, the biggest thing that has like kicked in just, just really

**00:48:01** in like the last three weeks, I can suddenly feel it is, hey, your theme is year of work.

**00:48:09** You got to work on your work and you got to work on your health. And when you work on your health,

**00:48:15** it doesn't happen immediately. It takes a little while and I'm just feeling great. It's like,

**00:48:21** I've lost weight. I've put on muscle mass. I've been doing aerobic exercises and it's like,

**00:48:26** suddenly it's really all starting to pay off. And it just feels really nice. It's also making it

**00:48:34** so clear to me how unwell I was last year and had this like weird inability to recognize it. It's

**00:48:42** like, all right. I've just like, I'm physically coming out of that. And it's fantastic. It's like,

**00:48:47** oh, yesterday I was really trying to like push writing a script and trying to get it done. And

**00:48:53** without even thinking about it, I noticed like, oh, I time tracked that I did three hours walking

**00:48:59** on a treadmill, talking out loud and typing the entire time. And it's like, I physically would

**00:49:05** not have been able to do that at any point last year. Fantastic. The health is now also helping

**00:49:11** the work part of this. This is exactly how I hoped it would go. And it's going that way. And

**00:49:17** suddenly I can really feel it. I've made a little tweak to my schedule, which I kind of can't believe

**00:49:23** that I'm now this person. But so in the past, when I think about like, oh, how things have gone with

**00:49:28** exercise, it's like, oh, we've talked about how neither of us like exercise and I still don't like

**00:49:34** exercise. Like, but you got to do it. And an extremely effective thing, which really turned

**00:49:40** the corner for me on this was the first five minutes of exercise. Like you get up, you're just

**00:49:46** going to do five minutes. I opened FitBod, sponsor of the show sometimes. Basically every episode.

**00:49:53** Yeah, basically every episode. But you know, we love them. Yes, we do love them. I don't give app

**00:49:58** of the year awards, but I did give app of the year to FitBod one year. And I'd like, I still maintain

**00:50:02** it is one of the most life changing apps that I've used sponsorships aside. Like that's, you know,

**00:50:07** that's why they sponsor us. Like we love it. You should totally sign up for it. But I loved it

**00:50:11** because like it just told me, look, here's your most under exercise muscle group. Here's one

**00:50:16** exercise you could do with it right now. And I'm a big fan of this, like what's the minimum amount

**00:50:23** you can do to achieve something. And I did that for a long enough time of like, just do the one

**00:50:30** thing, five minutes, the most effective thing. This is the minimum viable amount of exercise.

**00:50:36** It eventually got under my skin and I developed a work routine, which was, okay, I'll do five

**00:50:41** minutes of exercise. I'll do a bunch of writing. And then later in the day I will do my real

**00:50:46** exercise, which should be like 25 minutes. So I'm getting 30 minutes in the day. You know, well,

**00:50:50** of course many days you find reasons to like not do the full exercise later. It's like, oh,

**00:50:56** I took so long getting started with writing or like, oh, now we have to do this other thing.

**00:51:00** But this year, the routine of exercise was established well enough. I thought, you know

**00:51:05** what, I'm going to try to be one of these people who like gets up and does their 30 minutes of

**00:51:09** exercise first thing in the morning. I don't think I could have done this years ago, but it's enough

**00:51:14** of a routine now that now I've been doing this all year. And I can see why tons of people recommend

**00:51:21** this as a schedule as like, this is what you should do before you do any work. Just do 30 minutes of

**00:51:26** exercise. I'm more shocked than anyone else that I am now one of those people, but that's what I've

**00:51:32** been doing all year and it's been working great. And I think if I'm going to try to make the pitch

**00:51:38** to people who don't want to do this, depending on the kind of work you do, one unexpected benefit

**00:51:45** that I didn't quite realize is the 30 minutes of exercise in the morning can serve two functions.

**00:51:54** It serves the wake up function, right? So like you can't just leap out of bed and get straight

**00:51:59** to work. You need some transition time to wake up. And I force myself that I'm not allowed to

**00:52:05** listen to audio books or podcasts or anything while I'm doing that. So it's got to be, if I'm

**00:52:09** listening to something, it's like music without lyrics. That's the only thing in the worst

**00:52:14** possible environment. Like, no, my cup immediately go to work. Don't listen to park. I'm sorry for

**00:52:20** me. Right? Like wake up immediately go to exercise. Don't listen to any podcasts.

**00:52:27** There's actually, there's one step that happens before that, of course, which is wake up,

**00:52:30** make coffee is actually the first thing that I do before brushing teeth, right? Because it's like,

**00:52:35** Oh, you can brush your teeth while the coffee's brewing. Bring coffee to exercise area,

**00:52:39** start exercising. It gives the coffee time to actually kick in to like start waking you up.

**00:52:45** Because it takes kind of like 20 minutes for coffee to actually be effective. And then by not

**00:52:49** listening to anything with words, it's been a way to kind of trick my brain into being just a little

**00:52:56** bit bored. And it's like, Oh, well, you know, you know what we need to do, we need to think about

**00:53:00** that script. Ooh, how could we say that thing better? Or like, Ooh, do you have some kind of

**00:53:04** solution to the problem from yesterday that we were trying to write about? So I've just discovered

**00:53:09** like, boy, this is a fantastic on ramp into going into work after the exercise. And so it's a small

**00:53:18** change in my routine, but it's been really good. And I'm just so happy about it. And yeah, the like,

**00:53:26** work on your health thing, I think I was kind of a little scared, like, Oh, have I just permanently

**00:53:32** damaged my health from last year? And so that's also why I come so high on this is like, Oh, no,

**00:53:39** like, I was just able to turn this around. And it's so good. But there's another part of this,

**00:53:44** which more Texans will know about because I mentioned it offhandedly in one of those

**00:53:49** post-show discussions. Now, you know, Mike, I've long had a problem. I want to work outside of my

**00:53:56** apartment. I have an office at home, but after three years of COVID, I need some place to go.

**00:54:03** That's not where I live all the time, 24 hours a day, as the sort of person who goes outside so

**00:54:09** rarely that he can mark the passage of the seasons by noticing when the sun stays up longer,

**00:54:14** suddenly when he's out like, Oh, it's actually quite different. So in a rare set of circumstances,

**00:54:20** the gods smiled upon Gray, they didn't completely solve his problem. But I was able to acquire not

**00:54:30** an office, but a parking spot, a parking spot that is a garage in the basement of my building.

**00:54:41** And originally, I was thinking, Oh, we'll get this thing as storage space for Christmas decorations

**00:54:48** and things. But I eventually realized it dawned on me. I was like, No, no, no, this can be a little

**00:54:54** gym in the basement of my building. No, wait, it can't just be a gym. It can be a tiny little

**00:55:00** office for me. And so what I have done in this like cinder block prison environment is I took a

**00:55:09** bunch of Christmas decoration boxes, I stacked them up in a corner, I grabbed an old laptop,

**00:55:15** I grabbed my old LG monitor, I put them on there, and it's like, now I have a standing desk. And the

**00:55:21** most important feature of the standing desk is that it is not in my actual apartment. So I can

**00:55:29** commute in quotes every morning with my mug of coffee into the basement parking spot garage,

**00:55:36** I can close the door, I can have privacy, and I can like exercise down there. And then once I'm

**00:55:42** done exercising, I can stand up and go to work at this little standing desk that I've made. And

**00:55:49** I'm absolutely loving this like, it's not a perfect solution. It's not an office outside of the house.

**00:55:55** It probably will be unworkable once summer rolls around and it's way too hot. Yeah, I'm full of that.

**00:56:03** I am extremely aware of like, oh, this might just be a six months of the year kind of solution. But

**00:56:09** for right now, it's just a great 80% solution. And it just feels like, oh, year of work,

**00:56:16** everything is coming up gray. Windows? No, right? There's no windows. No, there's no, no, there's

**00:56:22** a door. And then there's cinder blocks. There's no windows. Ventilation in general, or what's the

**00:56:28** air like in there? It's not great. So the other two things that are in there is there is an air

**00:56:38** filter, which was extremely grumpy when I first turned it on. It's like air quality down here is

**00:56:45** terrible. And it took a long time for that air filter to be like, you can breathe in this.

**00:56:50** It's like four weeks to okay. As is often the case with air filters and air quality monitors,

**00:56:54** you go like, oh, what could possibly be wrong with this air? And then the filter tells you

**00:56:58** everything, everything is wrong with this air. Like you shouldn't be breathing this. And yes,

**00:57:02** you know, if like someone else parks in an adjacent spot, that air filter kicks in real fast. It's

**00:57:07** like, no, no, no, this is no good. But it's fine. And also, I did take your suggestion from the

**00:57:13** previous episode and we did get the new Roomba, which is very exciting. Oh, good. Yes. But,

**00:57:20** our old Roomba retired now downstairs in the basement in this parking garage. And so,

**00:57:28** like I renamed him Groomba for garage Roomba. Naturally. Naturally. And Groomba is set to try

**00:57:40** and clear the garage every single day because, you know, like since cars park down there,

**00:57:46** it's like impossible to keep clean. And so Groomba goes out. I do just wonder, like, I don't think

**00:57:53** anyone in the building has like caught what's happening here. But man, let me tell you what,

**00:57:56** like Groomba is running. It's real loud, like in this environment. Just to confirm, because I think

**00:58:01** it's important for the picture painting in people's minds here, it's a private garage. You're not just

**00:58:06** like occupying a space in like, everyone can see you kind of garage, right? Yeah, I know. It has a

**00:58:11** door that can close. Can you imagine, like, it's just an underground car park. You're just like

**00:58:19** working out in the morning. Hi, Bill. Yeah. So, I mean, one of the things is I do kind of not want

**00:58:28** other people in the building to know what I'm up to down there. Sure. Right. Like I would much

**00:58:34** prefer that. Yeah. So say for example, Groomba running is like not exactly a real low key move,

**00:58:41** but is required so that I can breathe. It's also alarming because I can see when Groomba is running,

**00:58:46** my air quality thing can send up a little alert like, oh, the air is terrible down here because

**00:58:52** he's kicking up all the dust, right, for the team to take care of. But okay, what I've been scheming

**00:58:57** about, I haven't figured out if there's a workable way to do this, but I'm like, can I figure out a

**00:59:02** way to like stick a camera on this door so I can just see what's on the other side. And then if

**00:59:09** someone else is parking their car, I can just be real quiet until they leave. That's like on my

**00:59:14** list of potential like garage home improvements. I don't know if that's going to work out. I think

**00:59:18** probably not, but I've been scheming about it because I am dreading the day when some neighbor

**00:59:25** knocks on the door and is like, what are you doing? And it's like, uh, nothing, right? Is that

**00:59:33** a computer behind you? No. Is that a Roomba running on the floor? No, definitely not. Who would do that?

**00:59:40** So yes, this is why I say it is not a perfect solution, but the timing was just perfect. Like,

**00:59:47** we got access to this space in January. It dawned on me that it could be more than just a storage

**00:59:53** space and I set it up and I've been using it and I love it. So that's how your work is going for

**01:00:00** me so far. So I'm assuming that the secret garage office, Grofus has been helping you with the work,

**01:00:09** right? Like is, is the part that you're saying, right? Like you feel like you're on top of work

**01:00:14** because of this additional space. Yeah, totally. Like it's, it's always advantageous to change

**01:00:22** locations. I've always just been a huge fan of that. And this also feels like a way to kind of

**01:00:29** start afresh. My upstairs office from which I'm talking to you right now is lovely, but it still

**01:00:35** just has the problem that it is in the house and there's just always going to be distractions,

**01:00:40** right? There's deliveries or there's dogs or there's something going on. And this way,

**01:00:46** it's just easier to be downstairs. And it also gives the clear signal to my brain of,

**01:00:54** Hey, we're going down here. And this is what we're here to do. And on a personal level,

**01:01:00** I'm finding it just a funny kind of throwback because this is also the way that I started the

**01:01:08** YouTube channel years ago was in this little apartment that we rented in the city. It was,

**01:01:14** it was too small to work in, but there was a boiler room in the basement that nobody used.

**01:01:21** Oh my God. I remember talking to you about this. Yes. It was like this boiler room and it was

**01:01:27** like a terrible environment, but it was a place where I had enough space to stand up,

**01:01:33** walk back and forth a few paces. No one was down there. So I could talk out loud and like that is

**01:01:38** where I wrote the scripts. And I feel like I'm developing a theory that work environments that

**01:01:44** are slightly uncomfortable are actually very conducive to being serious about work.

**01:01:52** This episode of Cortex is brought to you by set app of all the tools available to us now,

**01:01:57** looking for something new to improve the way we work can feel like drowning in an ocean of

**01:02:01** different apps and services. There are just so many on the market and not all of them are worth

**01:02:06** your time and money. And what's more, so many of us are paying for apps and services that have

**01:02:11** never properly integrated into our workflows. So how do you know which apps are worth trying

**01:02:17** without emptying your wallet and subscriptions that you might forget to cancel in the future?

**01:02:21** The answer is set app set up as a platform that combines more than 230 powerful Mac and iOS apps

**01:02:28** and tools under one 999 subscription. Their selection of apps is super helpful for people

**01:02:33** who use their Macs to work, covering complete use cases like coding, designing, project in time

**01:02:39** management and more. Once subscribed, you get full access to all paid features of these apps,

**01:02:44** as well as new apps that are constantly being added to the platform. So you'll always be sure

**01:02:50** that you're not missing out on anything that can help you do your work more efficiently,

**01:02:54** all for just a fraction of the price. Set app is a smart way to get apps for people who create

**01:03:00** value with the help of their Apple devices. It takes away the pain of looking up comparing

**01:03:05** and buying and managing separate apps, and they partner with some of the world's best developers

**01:03:10** to handpick the most trustworthy and advanced paid apps for set app. I am a huge fan of set app.

**01:03:16** I subscribe myself and I have a bunch of apps that I've downloaded that help me get my work done

**01:03:21** every day. In the past, I've spoken about CleanShot X, which is just one of my favorite Mac apps of

**01:03:26** all time. It is a fantastic, perfect, incredibly advanced, but also simple and really great

**01:03:32** screenshot application for your Mac. It's in set app. I also have been using an app called PopClip

**01:03:38** recently. This is an app that gives you when you select text a little popover like you get on iOS

**01:03:43** for cut and copy, but there's also tons of extensions. So you can do interesting things

**01:03:47** like translating text. So I have a thing where I can select text and press a button and it turns

**01:03:52** it into title case, which is really easy for when I'm putting in the titles for our podcast episodes.

**01:03:58** I also use an app called DropZone. It lives up in my menu bar and I can drag and drop files over it.

**01:04:03** It pops down a little menu and I have a bunch of shortcut places that I can put files into. So

**01:04:08** I have a folder where I put my receipts for taxes. I have the ability to drop a file and air drop it

**01:05:06** are kind of similar to each other, right? Year of work, year of weekend. We're on the same page,

**01:05:12** fully aligned. This is the best I've done ever. Oh, good. At the start of a year. I'm really happy

**01:05:18** to hear that. I feel right now that I am all in on year of the weekend. What I think is helping

**01:05:23** us both of this is some of the things we've had in the past. They just naturally would take

**01:05:30** a longer period of time to see benefit. Oh, that's a good point. What we're doing right now,

**01:05:36** you can see it like mine is weekly. If I'm taking time every seven days to take time off,

**01:05:44** I'm if I'm being successful at that and just actually trying to do what I promised myself

**01:05:50** I would do, I'm seeing the benefits every single week. So it's been really nice. You know,

**01:05:56** I've done a few things. I created the weekend entry and timer that you suggested that I do.

**01:06:01** Oh, good. I'm not tracking like beginning of Saturday to end of Sunday, but it's purposeful

**01:06:07** things that I'm doing in that period. So like, for example, I went and spent some time with some

**01:06:11** friends last Thursday, but tracked it as weekend time because it matches in my mind for what the

**01:06:18** year of the weekend is. I've really been just keeping it front of mind, making sure I take the

**01:06:23** time if I'm working on the weekend, taking time off next week, like for I'll be working this

**01:06:28** weekend, I'll be editing this show and either Saturday or Sunday. So I've already marked off

**01:06:32** next Thursday as a weekend day. I don't have to do anything on those days. Like they're just like

**01:06:38** rest days. There's some video games hang out home, like that's just going to be a nice relaxed day.

**01:06:43** In general, I feel like I've been doing a better job of spending time with friends,

**01:06:46** which is something I really wanted to do. I've been spending a bit more time at home,

**01:06:50** but the home stuff is still up in the air. We have been really kind of like held back on being able

**01:06:56** to do the home improvements that we're wanting to do, because we want to decorate, but we needed to

**01:07:02** do some work in the bathroom, which should be starting over in the next few weeks. And then

**01:07:05** once that's done, everything else can start falling into place. I'm excited about that

**01:07:09** because then we can start moving that part forward. Similarly to you, actually, I've been very happy

**01:07:14** with my progress with what I am doing in health this year. So I'm continuing to do everything I

**01:07:21** was doing before, but I'm picking up some new things. So I have a new hobby that I'm trying out,

**01:07:26** which is golf. Oh, wow. Yep. That is a real Curb Your Enthusiasm style hobby. There's a good

**01:07:34** reason for this, though, about how it lines into my year of the weekend. So I have some friends

**01:07:38** that I grew up with, and we just so happened to have moved very close to each other, like three of

**01:07:44** us. And we went out and had dinner together, and we're trying to do this more often now. They both

**01:07:50** play golf, love golf. And so I thought, well, this is a good thing for me to try as a way to give us

**01:07:58** more excuses to spend time together. And so I've been taking golf lessons, and I am loving it.

**01:08:07** Wow. You're really hidden pro. Well, I feel like this is a thing that I would not just want to go

**01:08:14** to a golf course and just start smacking balls around. Like that's not going to end good for

**01:08:19** anybody. You're like learning the difference between the woods and the irons, coppers and

**01:08:26** putters and the coppers. The coppers are really important. But just like how to hold a golf club,

**01:08:31** like the posture, like it's very complicated. It's a very complicated thing to do even okay.

**01:08:37** I had mentioned I wanted to do this. Adina bought me a golf lesson for my birthday.

**01:08:41** And so I did that lesson, and I've been doing some lessons now. And this is one of those things

**01:08:46** where so like, I'm on my way to my lesson. And I'm thinking, I'll take next week off. I won't do a

**01:08:53** lesson next week. I'll do it in a couple of weeks time. Halfway through the lesson, I'm like,

**01:08:57** I'm coming back next week. It's like, it's got that kind of like holding me. It's just like an

**01:09:01** interesting activity, because it's a thing that you sometimes can just hit a ball and it goes

**01:09:06** straight and it flies far. And you're like, I'm the best ever. And then you hit something else,

**01:09:10** just smash straight into a wall. But like it has that kind of excitement too. It's fun. Like I'm

**01:09:16** enjoying it. It's it's keeping me active too. It's like another thing, right? It's like an

**01:09:19** additional thing that I'm doing, which is working out different muscles. And sometimes like if you,

**01:09:26** you know, I'm doing these lessons at a driving range, right? So you're just like hitting the balls,

**01:09:30** do it for an hour. Sometimes like, wow, that was that was a workout. Like you can feel it.

**01:09:34** Isn't it very asymmetrical, though? I feel like this is, it can't possibly be symmetrical,

**01:09:41** right? Because you you have like a favored hand and the way you're doing it.

**01:09:44** Oh, I mean, yeah, I'm not using this as a way to build muscle, but just like a cardiovascular

**01:09:47** kind of thing, right? Well, there's just a lot of movement in the body. And also, if you actually

**01:09:51** go and play golf, like I went with my friends, they were playing and I just went with them to

**01:09:56** see what it was like. And I did like 14,000 steps. Right. So like it's the mixture of these two

**01:10:03** things of like, yeah, you're not like running, you're not like doing a lot of hard hitting stuff. But

**01:10:09** if you know, just there is some muscle work in it. But then there's also just a lot of

**01:10:13** cardio work in it. So like, it's an interesting activity. I'm not doing it for health benefits.

**01:10:19** Right. But it's just something I'm aware of is like another kind of physical activity that I'm

**01:10:24** bringing into my life. But then the other change kind of like on the health perspective for me is

**01:10:29** I now walk for an hour every day, which is like nothing I was doing before. And it was like a

**01:10:35** choice that I made like my new commute, I can either change trains or walk for 25 minutes.

**01:10:42** Oh, that's a that is a very good decision. And so I walk for 20, I walk every day. And

**01:10:47** one of the great things now is we're in our previous place. As it got later into the evening,

**01:10:55** if I was working late, I would typically take taxis home because the commute was longer,

**01:11:01** it was more complicated. And I just found it frustrating. But now this commute is much simpler

**01:11:07** to do. It's actually a shorter distance on the train. So even though it takes around the same

**01:11:11** time can do in this walk. So I never take taxis home now. No matter pretty much no matter how

**01:11:16** late I work, I was in the studio until 10 o'clock last night and I still took the train. So I'm

**01:11:21** getting like an extra 50 minutes of exercise, like walking, but like enough exercise that my Apple

**01:11:27** Watch says, Hey, you working out? Like I get that every day now. And so like I feel like I've now

**01:11:32** got this additional base level of just general exercise that I didn't have before. On top of

**01:11:38** then the other things that I'll do in the gym using Fit Bud, doing the golf stuff like these

**01:11:43** are just like additional things on top. So like I'm pretty happy with what I'm doing there,

**01:11:48** even in just like simple decisions that I'm making. So that's nice. And presumably when you're doing

**01:11:53** the walk into work in the morning, you're not listening to anything, just silence so you can

**01:11:57** start thinking about how the day is going to go. You see I do the exact opposite. For me, listening to

**01:12:01** podcasts is important. And this gives me an easy way to make sure I'm keeping up with stuff and

**01:12:08** taking information. But something I'm pretty good at, which is just maybe different for how our

**01:12:14** brains are, like I could be listening to something and it will spark an idea. And I'm very good at

**01:12:20** stop listening and my brain will just go. I'm completely my own thought here for a while.

**01:12:26** And then that will sometimes spring into something where I'll then make a note, write something down

**01:12:30** or have an idea for something. But yeah, I don't have that like free brain time or whatever.

**01:12:37** But for me, it's more important to take in information, I think, with this stuff that I'm

**01:12:42** doing, which is current information rather than having that empty space. I've still got a few

**01:12:48** things I need to work on the balance in my calendar, what I was thinking of like smarter

**01:12:52** scheduling. So making sure that I'm compacting days together rather than like one podcast on

**01:12:58** this day, one on the next day. I'm still working on that. That's going to be a slow moving process,

**01:13:04** which I knew because it involves other people and trying to like climate stuff together.

**01:13:09** But yeah, outside of that, I'm very happy with the progress that I've made so far in the year

**01:13:13** or the weekend. Oh, good. Well, I'm very happy for both of us. We're pros now, man.

**01:13:20** Yeah, I actually think it's exactly what you said that these are, we both happen to have

**01:13:25** picked themes in which it is just much easier, much sooner to see progress. So perhaps these are also

**01:13:32** good beginner themes for people if they're trying to think of something. I think they are.

**01:13:35** And I also like these are working for us this time. I don't necessarily think that this is

**01:13:42** how I would always want to have my theme to be so measurable like this, because sometimes it does

**01:13:47** need to be something that is way bigger in scope. But like look at you last year, right? The year is

**01:13:53** like new decade, right? Like, yeah, sometimes you need that even though it's complicated to measure

**01:13:59** it week to week, season to season, it takes an entire year of reflection sometimes to see if

**01:14:04** you've actually made the progress that you want. But sometimes there are these kinds of themes where

**01:14:10** it is easier to measure it on a week by week basis. And that's just where we both happen to be right

**01:14:15** now. Yeah, that was totally what I just needed this year is like, I need to be clocking hours go.

**01:16:50** Shall we do some Ask Cortex Mike? Yes, we should. I would like to remind Cortexons that they can send

**01:16:56** in feedback now over at cortexfeedback.com, which is our new fancy feedback form and people can send

**01:17:02** in their questions there as many of the people did that we're going to talk about today.

**01:17:06** Tavis asks, what does Grey do on the back end of Cortex brand? You guys talk a lot about all the

**01:17:13** incredible work that Mike does behind the scenes. I'm interested to hear how much input Grey has in

**01:17:17** the process. This is a very good question. And I think is actually something worth highlighting.

**01:17:24** Maybe you would want to hear it. Like what I think about this. I don't know. Like quite,

**01:17:28** quite legitimately, I'm not sure how you're going to answer this question. So I also would like to

**01:17:33** know what does Grey do on the back end of Cortex brand? So the back end part is interesting because

**01:17:38** you could say on the front end part, obviously, Grey has a huge impact. You know, you've made

**01:17:43** videos about the journal, which is huge for the business because it's putting the products out

**01:17:48** a wide scope of people. Similarly with the video, right? I made the video, but you 100%

**01:17:55** helped me shape it, especially at the end. Right. Like, so the output side of it, I think people

**01:18:01** can see, but the back end side of it, we only ever talk about me, right? We talk about me designing,

**01:18:07** me managing the process, but there's still a bunch of other stuff. So one thing is Grey is an

**01:18:14** absolute sounding board for me with my thoughts, right? So we have a meeting every month, at least

**01:18:20** once a month, where we get together and talk about everything that we're thinking about, all of the

**01:18:25** ideas that we have, and we kind of talk through everything. And we are equals in these conversations.

**01:18:31** And very frequently, you'll push me, I'll push you. So there's a lot of back and forth in that.

**01:18:37** And while we talk about me as the product designer, I need you and your input to shape the products.

**01:18:46** So like, for example, we mentioned this, right? Psychic notepad was going to be very different.

**01:18:52** Like it was just going to be a dot grid. And I don't think the product would have worked so

**01:18:57** succinctly as the first iteration of this without you pushing on me to keep working on it until we

**01:19:05** came up with the adding of the to do list section. So I think that's really important for me in my

**01:19:11** design. The other thing is, this was just my idea. Our next product is your idea. So that's where it's

**01:19:21** going to change a little bit, I think I will be helping with the manufacturers. But when it comes

**01:19:27** to the actual conception and design of the product, it's your product. So I think that will change

**01:19:32** things. Whenever we talk about this next one, it's all on you, right? To tell people why they need it.

**01:19:40** Yeah, I think that's totally fair. We talk about what you do, because you're the chief product

**01:19:45** designer. Yeah. And like, that is just the more interesting part of the business to talk about.

**01:19:51** One other thing that you have been incredibly helpful on and has been a massive help for this

**01:19:57** business is all of the business infrastructure. Yeah, we are able to and take advantage of some

**01:20:03** of the things you set up with Gray Industries, which takes an incredible amount of pressure

**01:20:08** of both of us in how we run the business. Yeah, I guess that is also fair. Yes, there's like a lot

**01:20:13** of the foundational infrastructure of the company was basically copy pasted from Gray Industries

**01:20:19** stuff. But that's all that's also just like, not very interesting to talk about. No, but it's

**01:20:23** incredibly helpful and important, right? Because we're able to just use all of that infrastructure

**01:20:30** that you already use to help make our business run too. That is true. And I do like infrastructure.

**01:20:36** Mike knows that I'm secretly pushing for more infrastructure right now, and he's pushing back

**01:20:40** on that. Let me tell you everyone, I pitched Mike a big infrastructure project and he was very, whoa,

**01:20:48** very upset. What's really going on? We'll see. Colton wants to know, either of you still using

**01:20:56** a Wacom tablet as another pointing device? If so, which one would you recommend? For me,

**01:21:02** this is a fast answer. No, I basically stopped doing this after I transitioned to working with

**01:21:08** an animator. For me, the Wacom tablet was entirely about animation. Right. And I essentially don't do

**01:21:16** that anymore, except for like very minor tweaks here and there. So yeah, I've, I've retired my

**01:21:22** Wacom tablets, I've hung it up and that's it. No more for me. Cool. Well, that's good. I still do.

**01:21:28** For me, it's similar to you in a way of like, I use it just for audio editing. So I have two desks,

**01:21:36** right? In my studio, I have the one where I do my recording and then I have the one where I just do

**01:21:41** regular work. On the regular desk, I have a mouse and a magic trackpad. So I'm using the Logitech

**01:21:49** MX Master 3S. Yeah, great mouse. This is the one with the silent clicking. Oh, it's, it's, I'm sorry,

**01:21:56** this is a different model than I didn't know it has silent. The 3S. The S is silent. So,

**01:22:02** great. I'm going to put my mouse up to the microphone now and click it three times. All right.

**01:22:07** Okay. Did you hear that? Barely. Yeah, I know that sound. Yeah. Okay. Huh.

**01:22:14** It's a very good mouse. The clicking is silent. It's wonderful.

**01:22:17** Open up an Amazon. It's great. It's the MX Master 3 with a silent click. Like that's what it is.

**01:22:25** For when I'm recording, perfect. And the trackpad I use, you know, for panning around and gestures

**01:22:31** and stuff like that. So I have that on my second desk. Like that's what I have on there. And then

**01:22:36** on my recording desk, I have a trackpad, a mouse and the Wacom Intuos Pro Wacom tablet.

**01:22:44** And I use it just for editing. So when I'm in logic, that's how I do all of my editing.

**01:22:49** It's very comfortable for me. Now it's how I'm used to doing things too. Right. So for example,

**01:22:54** if I ever needed to edit somewhere else, having a Wacom tablet is super important for me. Not that

**01:23:01** I really do anymore, but I did have to do some editing last year at home and I luckily had my

**01:23:08** old Wacom there so I could just break that one out because like I'm just so slow doing it otherwise.

**01:23:14** Yeah. That's the one I recommend. Yeah. I think I sort of forgot that one of the other reasons I

**01:23:17** gave of the using a secondary pointing device was I did use to use it for the audio editing,

**01:23:22** but I just made a real effort to I'm going to become super fast with keyboard shortcuts for

**01:23:28** the audio editing and kind of changed my workflow. So that was the other reason I could give that up

**01:23:32** is I did use the pen, like I completely forgot how much I used to use the pen for that, but

**01:23:37** it's hard to beat keyboard shortcuts. And so I just, I just transitioned to that while I was

**01:23:42** offloading animation work. And it's like, Oh, I don't actually need this tool anymore for myself.

**01:23:46** Unknown Misk asks, do you like and or use the swipe typing feature on iOS?

**01:23:52** I want to love it. I really do. But I feel like it still misses too much to be annoying and

**01:24:04** like one miss in a sentence really can throw off the whole reason to use it in the first place.

**01:24:11** I want to use it. I do try to use it sometimes. And I almost always like it just doesn't stick.

**01:24:15** It's not actually a huge win. And I've also I'll just like since this is typing on a keyboard

**01:24:22** stuff. I don't know if I turned this feature off. What is it called? It's is it the keyboard clicks

**01:24:28** of like the haptic thing? Yeah, so I think I had turned this off on my phone where like the

**01:24:32** keyboard makes a little haptic sensation when you type the keys. I recently rediscovered this

**01:24:38** because I use someone's phone. I was like, What is this? And then I realized like, Oh, I can turn

**01:24:42** this feature on. I really like the keyboard with the haptics on. And I think it makes it I don't

**01:24:48** know if it's just psychological, but it feels like it's more accurate. And it's and like, I'm,

**01:24:52** I'm better able to type with like a tiny bit of physical feedback from the keyboard. So that has

**01:24:57** also not helped me with the swiping. It's like, No, no, I want to feel a little satisfying clicks

**01:25:01** while I'm typing to someone. Do you use it? The swipe typing I use basically exclusively

**01:25:08** on my iPhone. I use it all the time. I love it. Yes, it causes errors, but I was making errors

**01:25:15** anyway before me and me and auto corrective never really been good friends, but I rely on it

**01:25:21** constantly anyway. It makes lots of errors for me. I have like a weird thing. I don't know where

**01:25:27** this comes from with the haptics. As I say this out loud, I know how weird this sounds. I wish I

**01:25:32** had an answer for this. It makes me feel nauseous. That's weird. I know. That's very weird. Right.

**01:25:38** I don't know why I tried it for a while and it made me feel really uncomfortable. Yeah. Don't

**01:25:43** do that. And now I can't use it. This is one of those things where I feel like maybe when I first

**01:25:49** tried it, I was maybe unwell and now it's like locked in my brain. Right. Right. And now I can't

**01:25:56** get it out. Like I just thought about turning it on and it made me not feel good. So like that

**01:26:00** feature is gone for me for completely like irrational unknowable reason brains and

**01:26:07** RIP haptics are weird. But I use the swipe typing anyway, so I don't need the haptics.

**01:26:12** Yeah. And also I forgot I do use it in one scenario, which is on my iPad with the pencil.

**01:26:17** I do love it for that. And I feel like I actually kind of forgot that that is the place that I use

**01:26:22** it all the time. Yeah. That to me is really good. And I think the pencil makes it just precise

**01:26:25** enough that it gets over it. But yeah, on my phone, I never use it. So actually to kind of

**01:26:30** like wrap these two questions in together, you still use the Apple pencil at the time on your

**01:26:34** iPad. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's the primary interface for the iPad easily. And so I always

**01:26:39** float the keyboard as the little mini iPhone size keyboard whenever I'm using my iPad. And then I

**01:26:45** use the pencil to swipe type on that. And I find that that's pretty fast. So for me, considering

**01:26:49** that my only iPad that I use now is an iPad mini, I don't use the Apple pencil anymore. Yeah, I can

**01:26:55** see that on the mini. It's small enough. It's as big as it. It just feels ridiculous. You know,

**01:27:01** like it doesn't it doesn't work the same for me. Like it does work, but it's just not. Yeah,

**01:27:06** it's just not what I want to do. It's also like, Oh, yes, you're down to a mini and my iPad is 80%

**01:27:13** a magic machine. And it does feel a little bit like, Oh, how far the iPad has fallen. Yeah,

**01:27:19** that's the way things go. I mean, yes, but it's not like it's a bad story. Really. Like for me,

**01:27:26** the iPad has fallen because the Mac is so good. Yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah. The iPad never changed. I

**01:27:32** mean, that's actually part of the problem, but like, it wasn't really anything the iPad did for me.

**01:27:37** It was just like the Mac just became unavoidable because of how great it was becoming, including

**01:27:44** the MacBook Air, which actually when you came over, you saw the M2 MacBook Air for the first time,

**01:27:48** right? Yeah. Yeah. I was super impressed with it. I really, I really loved it. Yeah. Perfect machine.

**01:27:54** You're always making these assessments, but I am, I am very aware of like, Oh, iPad,

**01:27:58** you haven't, you haven't changed. Third time was not the charm for multitasking. And it's like,

**01:28:04** in the meantime, Apple's just gone all in on, on the laptops and like, honestly, I'm happy about

**01:28:11** the way it's gone. Like I think the Mac being good, even if it's not the most popular system,

**01:28:17** like it's the most important system that it's really good aside obviously from the iPhone,

**01:28:21** like it matters that Macs are, are healthy and good. And so I've been, I've been very

**01:28:26** happy to see how well those things have gone. But yeah, it does mean I'm like iPad, you're

**01:28:32** for loading up magic, the gathering. That's what you're for. Yep. For me, it's video, reading news,

**01:28:39** maybe a little social media, checking the occasional email. Honestly, I use my iPad

**01:28:46** now how people just use their iPads. Like, yeah, that's what iPads are actually made for. Really?

**01:28:51** Yeah. And that's what I use it for. Yeah. Because my second biggest use is RSS reading. And it's like,

**01:28:56** yes, that was the original demo back in the day. Like you're going to read the news. And it's like,

**01:29:01** Oh yes, now I'm reading some articles through RSS on my iPad. This episode of Cortex is brought to

**01:31:04** Tim asks, in one of the early episodes of Cortex,

**01:31:07** Gray said that certain songs get stuck in his head and he listens to them on a massive repeat loop.

**01:31:13** On that episode, it was Rachel Planton's fight song. Man, every time I hear that,

**01:31:19** that was stuck in his head. My question is, does Gray still do this? And if so,

**01:31:23** what song is currently on loop? Wow. Fight song. That was like a hundred songs on loops ago.

**01:31:29** It does still make it back into the rotation. Fight song is surprisingly good.

**01:31:33** I mean, yeah, like I don't think I could not do this. This is just a foundational part of the way

**01:31:39** I work is listening to something on repeat, which I also just realized now is a song that can be heard

**01:31:45** on repeat playing behind the door of a parking spot in the basement of my building.

**01:31:52** So I went through this thing recently where for the video of the Psychic Notepad, I went back

**01:31:59** and listened to some of the saga of you in your office. Many and many episodes ago,

**01:32:06** where you had an office and you were upset at somebody who was in the office next to you,

**01:32:10** because they were there when you were there and they would write things on the whiteboard.

**01:32:15** And I wanted to hear you say what they were so I could write them down on the Psychic Notepad

**01:32:19** for one of the shots. So it just had a lot of Easter eggs in that video, by the way.

**01:32:24** And in one of those episodes was the moment where I came to the realization

**01:32:30** that when you were complaining about him, you were recording the audio for the rules for

**01:32:35** rulers video. So he was listening to you talking about like stamping down the infrastructure of

**01:32:42** society or whatever, like out loud. And this is reminding me of that, which is like, oh, you know,

**01:32:49** I'm just trying to keep myself to myself. But yet nevertheless, there's a Roomba going on in there

**01:32:53** and air purifier and some song on repeat for five hours a day. Yeah. So I mean, I know I like

**01:33:00** the current one, I have kind of a playlist that I'm rotating through. But I do I have this thing,

**01:33:06** which is like songs match videos. And oftentimes that match doesn't make any sense to an external

**01:33:12** person. It doesn't make any sense to me. But it's just like, oh, Britney Spears, I want to go just

**01:33:17** like matches this video that I'm working on. Like, great, let's do that. But the thing that I'm

**01:33:22** currently working on is like an America topic. And I do find that America topics, I want songs

**01:33:30** that have kind of like an America sound. And I don't always know even know what that means. But

**01:33:35** for Springsteen. That's what that means. Yeah, I know that like I know that's what people would

**01:33:40** think. But it's not quite right. So when I said earlier in the show, like, oh, I was I was walking

**01:33:45** and talking for three hours in a row. I happen to know that was that was yesterday. And I had

**01:33:51** Bury My Bones by Whiskey Myers on repeat the entire time for three hours. And I will again

**01:33:58** remind people like that sounds like water torture. But there is a way in which like I just I can't

**01:34:05** describe it. I'm not processing the song in the way that you normally listen to it. It's something

**01:34:11** about like the fact that it is on loop keeps me on loop and I'm just like working, working, working,

**01:34:16** so I have a normal playlist of like intensely repeat songs that I go back to a bunch. I've always

**01:34:22** said it's like Pareto number two in violin D minor is the reigning champ of that list. But for

**01:34:28** America stuff, I have a list and I'm actually going to look for suggestions for the listener.

**01:34:33** So my America working playlist and sometimes driving in America playlist is called Crazy

**01:34:40** Country Songs and it's songs that are in the country genre. But there you can find country

**01:34:48** songs that are like kind of jokes on country songs. But the key thing here to me is they can't be

**01:34:53** making fun of country songs. They have to also be genuine country songs. So on my list here as an

**01:35:02** example from the Far Cry soundtrack, there's a song called Keep Your Rifle By Your Side. It is

**01:35:08** like a crazy cult singing about why they need to keep their guns by their side. It is a very

**01:35:13** America sound. It's like it's on my crazy country list. I've got Rednecker by Hardy, which is a song

**01:35:20** about like who's more of the redneck. There's a song called Beer Never Broke My Heart by Luke

**01:35:25** Combs, which is great. What's going on? No, it's good. I've got Mama's Broken Heart by Miranda

**01:35:31** Lambert and she's very good. There's By Me a Boat by Chris Jansen, which is a song about like wanting

**01:35:38** some money to buy a boat. Yeah. So anyway, it's like Talk of the Repair Song Blues by Alan Jackson,

**01:35:44** which is a song about getting your car fixed while you're trying to write a country song.

**01:35:50** Anyway, they're just like these songs that are genuinely country songs, but there's like

**01:35:56** something funny about them or they're intrinsically silly. They're not parodies. That's not what you're

**01:36:01** looking for. Yeah, like this is the key thing. I actually really hate country parodies because I

**01:36:07** feel like they're making fun of something that's real. These songs all come from the different

**01:36:12** angle. Like a lot of them are like they're country singers and they're just doing something kind of

**01:36:18** fun and ridiculous with the genre, but it's not a parody of the actual genre. So my problem is like

**01:36:27** I've read you basically the majority of the really good ones on this list that I think serve as an

**01:36:32** example and I want more. I have a recommendation for you. Okay. When we were in Memphis, I heard

**01:36:38** this song on the radio and it was perfect for me in this idea. It's called Chicken Fried. It's by

**01:36:46** a band called The Foundation. Okay. And it is a country song about a guy who says that this is

**01:36:55** the opening lines are, you know, I like my chicken fried, a cold beer on a Friday night,

**01:37:00** a pair of jeans that fit just right. Zach Brown? Zach Brown band. Yes. Okay. Zach Brown band. I'll

**01:37:05** try it. Like there was just something about this song, which to me was just like, so I just really

**01:37:11** enjoyed the simplicity of it where it was just like, I like my things to be just right. Yeah. And

**01:37:16** there was just something about that where I was like, I respect you, you know, like it was like a

**01:37:21** fun little song. Didn't really have much consequence. It sounded like from what I could hear on the

**01:37:25** radio. Like I don't know if this is exactly what you're looking for, but this was what that reminded

**01:37:30** me of. Yeah. It's, it's, this is why I'm so picky with this. It's why I have such a small list,

**01:37:35** but that could work as like Miranda Lambert has a lot of songs that are like that. There's like

**01:37:39** fun country songs and there's, there's sort of like simple and straightforward, but yeah, it's

**01:37:44** like a song called beer never broke. My heart is exactly what it sounds like. You know, football

**01:37:49** teams break your heart, girls break your heart, but you know what never breaks your heart? Beer.

**01:37:53** Yep. Great. Love it. Hey everyone, show's over. You can all go home now, but if you're looking for

**01:38:04** more cortex, there's more texts, the after show discussion where Mike and I talk meta issues or

**01:38:10** little things that it just didn't make sense to put in the show itself. For example, this week,

**01:38:15** we talk about AI and the very fact that it's changing so fast. We can't put it in the main

**01:38:21** show at all, which really proved itself because between recording and releasing,

**01:38:27** GPT four came out changing everything all over again. So if you'd like to support the show and
