# Cortex - 104: RGB on the eGPU
**00:00:00** How does Google Docs not have a dark mode?

**00:00:02** Because they're idiots and I hate them.

**00:00:04** Whoa.

**00:00:06** I'm really f***ed off at Google Docs at the moment.

**00:00:08** I just clicked on the little thing on my icon.

**00:00:10** I was like, surely there must be a dark mode button here.

**00:00:13** I didn't realize I was opening up Mike Fury over that.

**00:00:16** I'm seriously considering moving to Microsoft Word or something.

**00:00:21** Really?

**00:00:21** Yeah.

**00:00:22** I should retract that tremendous question mark, really,

**00:00:25** because I haven't used Microsoft Word in 10 years.

**00:00:30** I'm not up to date.

**00:00:32** Maybe Word's amazing now.

**00:00:34** But when I was putting together worksheets for school,

**00:00:38** Word was no fun, no fun whatsoever.

**00:00:41** So there's a lot of asterisks here,

**00:00:43** because I know that Word has a collaboration now.

**00:00:48** You can do Google Docs-like collaboration,

**00:00:52** but I don't know how good it is.

**00:00:53** I would need to test that out.

**00:00:56** But the thing is, Microsoft seems

**00:00:58** to be adding more features to Word that are modern

**00:01:01** on the platforms that they're on, including iPad OS

**00:01:05** than Google is.

**00:01:06** So you can have multiple Word documents side by side

**00:01:10** on iPad OS right now.

**00:01:12** You can't do that on Google Docs.

**00:01:15** You can't do that with Google Docs?

**00:01:16** No.

**00:01:17** They don't have the multi-window support.

**00:01:19** Wait, when was multi-window support last year?

**00:01:22** Or was that two years ago?

**00:01:23** That was last year.

**00:01:25** It was, OK, I'm thinking, right, sorry, yes.

**00:01:27** Multi-window support, they haven't added it.

**00:01:29** They haven't added that.

**00:01:30** There's no dark mode.

**00:01:31** Now, I don't think Word has a dark mode either.

**00:01:33** But Microsoft have committed to adding the trackpad support

**00:01:38** by the end of the year.

**00:01:41** You're never going to get that kind of commitment out of Google.

**00:01:44** Maybe they'll do it.

**00:01:45** Maybe they won't.

**00:01:46** And the thing is with Google Docs and its history

**00:01:51** over the last few years is maybe you'll get those features.

**00:01:54** Maybe it'll take forever to come.

**00:01:55** You're just going to have to wait for them.

**00:01:57** Really, these days, Microsoft have more of a vested interest

**00:02:00** in keeping the product up to date because you pay for it.

**00:02:03** Oh, right, because that's the office.

**00:02:04** Office 365.

**00:02:05** Yes, of course.

**00:02:07** And Google Docs is what, like a charity project by Google,

**00:02:09** I guess?

**00:02:10** Yeah, I mean, I'm paying Google for G Suite.

**00:02:13** But that includes so many millions of things.

**00:02:17** So yeah, it's something that I've

**00:02:19** been mulling around in my head.

**00:02:20** I've been thinking about it.

**00:02:22** I'm considering it.

**00:02:23** And that's why you've caught me at a time when I'm particularly

**00:02:26** salty about Google Docs.

**00:02:29** Google Docs is great in the fact that it's available everywhere.

**00:02:32** And the collaboration stuff is rock solid.

**00:02:35** But if Microsoft can give me most of the collaboration

**00:02:38** stuff in almost real time, and they also

**00:02:42** will make an app that feels modern,

**00:02:44** then that's probably where I'm going to go eventually.

**00:02:47** So you're thinking of this, what, primarily

**00:02:49** for the show notes stuff?

**00:02:50** Yeah, for show notes.

**00:02:51** Google I use Google Docs for, really,

**00:02:53** is like shared collaborative documents, which for me

**00:02:57** is like 95% of those are show notes documents.

**00:03:01** So I do, this is the other thing.

**00:03:03** It's like I'm dragging mails on this a little bit,

**00:03:05** is I have to try and convince everyone to use Word then.

**00:03:10** Which might not be easy.

**00:03:11** So I really want to make sure that my case that I

**00:03:14** make to all of my co-hosts is a solid one.

**00:03:17** So I need to really spend some time making sure

**00:03:21** that that's the right move for everybody, which

**00:03:23** is the other reason why I'm putting it off,

**00:03:24** because that feels like a lot of work.

**00:03:26** Right, yeah.

**00:03:27** Because I stopped myself because I suddenly realized,

**00:03:30** no, this is a collaboration problem as well.

**00:03:32** So you have multiple people.

**00:03:34** Of all the possible tools in the world,

**00:03:36** why would you switch to Word?

**00:03:37** But I guess maybe that one has the highest probability

**00:03:41** of being able to convince people to switch,

**00:03:45** as opposed to something like Dropbox paper or Notion,

**00:03:49** which might be more esoteric based on users.

**00:03:53** We don't say Notion around here because.

**00:03:55** Why don't we say Notion around here?

**00:03:57** Because it brings out the Notion nation.

**00:03:59** People that use Notion, they really love it.

**00:04:04** And then every time we mention it,

**00:04:06** people want to know why we're not using it.

**00:04:08** And I am using it, but don't really understand it.

**00:04:11** Well, I mean, look, I bring up Notion

**00:04:13** because recently my assistant has

**00:04:15** decided that the entire back end of the Grey Empire

**00:04:19** is going to convert to Notion.

**00:04:20** And it's like, well, I'm along for this ride as well.

**00:04:23** So Dropbox paper got ejected, and now it's Notion time.

**00:04:26** Maybe we need to talk about Notion

**00:04:28** at some point in the future.

**00:04:30** Yeah, but I don't know anything about Notion.

**00:04:32** That's what I mean.

**00:04:33** She set up all these things.

**00:04:34** I'm afraid.

**00:04:35** I don't know how to use it.

**00:04:36** Why is it so scary, right?

**00:04:39** You know what's so scary about Notion

**00:04:41** is that there's a million YouTube videos about people

**00:04:43** that run their entire lives from Notion.

**00:04:45** And the notion of that notion is terrifying.

**00:04:49** Part of the workflow process for me with the videos

**00:04:52** is that you have what's called a work in progress document.

**00:04:55** So it's like the way the animator and I communicate.

**00:04:57** Like, here's the list of all the things

**00:04:59** that need to be done for the animation

**00:05:01** in order for it to be considered complete.

**00:05:04** And again, that could be Google Docs.

**00:05:05** We just happened to use Dropbox paper

**00:05:07** for a variety of reasons.

**00:05:09** But now that my back end has been switched for me to Notion,

**00:05:13** I was like, well, how hard can it

**00:05:15** be to make a new page to start a new area for me

**00:05:19** and then I was like, oh, I'm terrified to click anything.

**00:05:23** I don't understand all of, what are these permissions?

**00:05:26** So the end result there was I found myself

**00:05:29** in the position of sending a message like,

**00:05:32** could you please create an area that we could use

**00:05:36** so that we could communicate in this way?

**00:05:38** And it's like, oh yes.

**00:05:39** You can't just create a page.

**00:05:41** The page is merely a container for sub pages

**00:05:44** and the sub pages are where the work in progress documents

**00:05:46** can go.

**00:05:47** The thing I can't get my head around,

**00:05:49** like you create a page,

**00:05:50** but that page is now just like an entry in the Wiki

**00:05:53** and it's like, but why can't I just start writing?

**00:05:57** Because you haven't enabled the text block, but why?

**00:06:00** Why though?

**00:06:01** That's a good comparison.

**00:06:02** It's very Wiki.

**00:06:03** It feels like Notion is the new,

**00:06:06** oh, just use a Wiki for that.

**00:06:07** A Wiki will solve all of your problems

**00:06:09** because it can be everything.

**00:06:11** Notion has already spawned a bunch of companies

**00:06:14** that wanna be like Notion.

**00:06:15** Have you heard of Roam Research?

**00:06:17** Oh yes.

**00:06:18** This is the other one I'm dimly aware of.

**00:06:21** A number of people have messaged me and been like,

**00:06:23** hey man, I've got the solution to your Evernote problem.

**00:06:26** It's called Roam.

**00:06:27** That's why, yeah, yeah, that's why you're hearing about it.

**00:06:30** I know nothing about Roam Research.

**00:06:31** I looked at it for two seconds and was like,

**00:06:34** this looks like Dropbox paper, I guess?

**00:06:36** I don't know.

**00:06:37** All I know is at the moment is that it lives on the web.

**00:06:40** That's the only place that it exists right now.

**00:06:43** So like that's immediately out for me.

**00:06:44** Even a Notion's iOS apps suck

**00:06:47** because they're just web views.

**00:06:49** I at least wanna have an app, right?

**00:06:51** Yeah, yeah, I want an app as well.

**00:06:52** I feel the same way.

**00:06:54** The other thing I know about Roam Research

**00:06:55** is that it's basically just like a really powerful

**00:06:58** personal Wiki builder.

**00:06:59** So I use Notion, people may remember this.

**00:07:02** I mentioned it in the past.

**00:07:03** I use Notion to collect up everything

**00:07:05** to do with Cortex brand.

**00:07:07** So all of our ideas and all of our little pieces

**00:07:11** of information, it all goes into there.

**00:07:14** You mean Evernote, you don't mean Notion?

**00:07:16** No, I mean Notion.

**00:07:17** Oh, okay.

**00:07:18** Yeah, I moved it from Evernote to Notion

**00:07:21** because I realized I couldn't handle Evernote.

**00:07:23** I think I just mentally blocked out that entire process.

**00:07:27** Yeah.

**00:07:28** So like this is what I use for that stuff.

**00:07:30** And like it does the job,

**00:07:32** but this is one of those applications that as I'm using it,

**00:07:35** like I feel guilty for not feeling

**00:07:38** like I'm using it properly

**00:07:39** because everybody talks about how like,

**00:07:42** oh, you can run your entire business in this application.

**00:07:44** And I look at it and I'm like,

**00:07:46** I don't know how I would do that.

**00:07:48** But it's like, you know, I set up something

**00:07:49** and it looks like a page, but no,

**00:07:51** this is now just a folder.

**00:07:52** It's like, okay, so why doesn't it have a folder icon?

**00:07:55** It's all very confusing to me, Gray.

**00:07:57** Yeah, I was trying to add something on my iPad

**00:07:59** where I was writing a sentence.

**00:08:01** I just wanted to use the phrase and slash or in a sentence.

**00:08:06** And so I'm typing out and slash.

**00:08:08** And the second I hit the slash,

**00:08:09** it brings up this big menu of options.

**00:08:12** Oh my God, I just did it.

**00:08:15** Like I'm happy this exists,

**00:08:17** but why on earth can I drop in a calendar now?

**00:08:19** Right, yes.

**00:08:20** And so I was unable to successfully type the slash symbol.

**00:08:26** Oh, I just found something terrible.

**00:08:28** Why is there a calendar here now?

**00:08:30** Okay.

**00:08:31** Yeah, that's what can happen.

**00:08:32** So I spent, I don't know, 30 seconds trying to figure out,

**00:08:37** okay, notion must need an escape character

**00:08:41** for letting me type the slash.

**00:08:43** So I'm like, what is it?

**00:08:44** Was it that I needed to type?

**00:08:45** I could not figure out for the life of me

**00:08:47** how to type the slash.

**00:08:48** So I just said, oh, it I'm doing the other slash

**00:08:51** the other way.

**00:08:52** So like an idiot, I wrote and slash or with the back

**00:08:55** or slash.

**00:08:58** Because it was just like,

**00:08:59** I can't figure out what the escape sequence is

**00:09:01** that you want here.

**00:09:02** I'm on my iPad.

**00:09:03** It feels a little finicky because it is this web view.

**00:09:05** Like it's not quite working the way it's supposed to anyway.

**00:09:08** I'm like, the hell with this.

**00:09:10** They'll know what I mean and slash or

**00:09:12** I just look like a moron.

**00:09:13** I wrote it backwards.

**00:09:15** Yeah, I don't, I don't,

**00:09:16** I feel like I just don't understand this application.

**00:09:18** I have a bunch of YouTube videos that I've saved

**00:09:21** to my watch later queue.

**00:09:22** Right.

**00:09:23** Yeah, of course.

**00:09:24** The various productivity YouTube is explaining notion.

**00:09:25** And like at some point I'm going to watch those videos

**00:09:28** and see if they can try and explain it to me.

**00:09:30** But right now it feels a little like it's a lot.

**00:09:33** And I feel like I just want to do something very simple

**00:09:35** with it and it does not want me to do that.

**00:09:38** Right.

**00:09:39** This is not a candidate for switching your show notes

**00:09:43** and trying to get everybody else on board.

**00:09:45** I don't want to accidentally drop in a four page calendar

**00:09:48** into my cortex show notes document.

**00:09:51** Right.

**00:09:52** Or on any of your other shows have your co-hosts

**00:09:54** accidentally drop in a relational database

**00:09:56** in the middle of a bullet point.

**00:09:58** Like, oops, I pressed the space key

**00:10:00** and now there's a page for every word in this document.

**00:10:05** So long and short of it is there should be a better tour.

**00:10:09** I think for doing this collaboration stuff now,

**00:10:12** like just very simple, like we have outlines.

**00:10:15** And I feel like word is a strong contender for,

**00:10:20** here is a product where there is a vested interest

**00:10:23** by the creators of this product to make it modern.

**00:10:27** And I just don't think Google has that anymore.

**00:10:29** Yeah.

**00:10:30** With Google Docs.

**00:10:31** Well, because plus as we're recording this today,

**00:10:33** there was like this, I saw this article of like,

**00:10:38** Google wants to integrate all of their features

**00:10:40** into Gmail to be more like Slack.

**00:10:43** No, no.

**00:10:44** Yeah, man.

**00:10:45** Google chat rooms and meet to come into Gmail.

**00:10:49** And it's kind of just like, well, eventually I suppose

**00:10:52** they're going to want to swallow Google Docs up into that.

**00:10:54** And like, I don't want that, right?

**00:10:57** And I feel like eventually they can,

**00:10:58** that's what they're going to want me to do.

**00:11:00** And so it's a different type of product, right?

**00:11:03** Like Google wants everything all integrated

**00:11:05** and Microsoft just want you to pay them every month.

**00:11:08** And I feel like that those business models will end up

**00:11:11** with me seeing that maybe Microsoft Word

**00:11:14** is a better option for the stuff that we're doing.

**00:11:16** Yeah.

**00:11:17** Imagine like a native feeling application

**00:11:19** where we could put our show notes into, imagine that.

**00:11:21** Yeah, I mean, that would be nice.

**00:11:23** I mean, I'm here using Flotado to have Google Docs

**00:11:27** in a little app on the computer.

**00:11:29** Yeah.

**00:11:30** I hate it.

**00:11:30** It's like, it's better than having it in a browser

**00:11:32** because I won't lose it.

**00:11:33** It's like, oh yes, it's just a thing I can Alt-Tab to.

**00:11:36** But can I get a desktop app for Google Docs?

**00:11:38** That would be lovely.

**00:11:39** What about we could do a little challenge here.

**00:11:43** What if I make it so our next episode,

**00:11:46** we do the show notes, like our internal show notes in Word

**00:11:50** and just see what happens.

**00:11:51** I mean, okay, I can agree to that

**00:11:53** because this is 99% on your shoulders

**00:11:56** and 1% on my shoulders.

**00:11:57** Yeah, basically all you need to do is accept the invitation

**00:12:00** and you've done all you need to do.

**00:12:01** But that's my 1%, that's my contribution, Mike.

**00:12:06** I will click accept and install from the app store

**00:12:11** like a soft word.

**00:12:12** I don't know.

**00:12:13** Is it on the app store?

**00:12:14** Yeah, yeah.

**00:12:14** Oh, okay, cool.

**00:12:16** All right, I can commit to that, Mike.

**00:12:17** We can try Word for show notes next time.

**00:12:20** You can run Cortex show notes as the beta

**00:12:22** for your convince everyone to use Word plan.

**00:12:25** I never could have imagined that this show

**00:12:27** would be the beta for something like that.

**00:12:29** But I guess I've caught you at the right moment as well.

**00:12:32** You've caught me at the exact right moment.

**00:12:34** Yeah.

**00:12:35** This is the only thing I use Google Docs for

**00:12:39** is Cortex show notes.

**00:12:41** So I guess the only thing that we need to do as a test

**00:12:44** we can do when we're recording

**00:12:45** is seeing if like the collaboration is real time

**00:12:48** because Google is, right?

**00:12:49** Like then that's what makes Docs so powerful.

**00:12:51** So if I start typing a word,

**00:12:53** you see it literally as it's happening.

**00:12:55** Yes, yes.

**00:12:56** Or I think like Apple Pages has their pseudo real time.

**00:13:00** Pages isn't good enough.

**00:13:01** Apple notes isn't good enough.

**00:13:02** Oh, I didn't think about Apple notes.

**00:13:03** You've tried it.

**00:13:04** It's not good enough.

**00:13:05** It's not real time enough.

**00:13:06** It updates frequently, but not real time.

**00:13:09** And you know, like in some of my shows,

**00:13:11** like multiple people can be adding notes in

**00:13:14** or it like the same part in the document

**00:13:16** because like someone's talking.

**00:13:17** Real time matters.

**00:13:18** Real time, 100% matters.

**00:13:19** It can't be close to real time for this sort of thing.

**00:13:21** Right.

**00:13:22** Cause it's like, you know, like imagine

**00:13:23** if you're saying something now, it's like,

**00:13:24** Oh, that's a good point.

**00:13:24** I want to make sure I remember it.

**00:13:26** Like I will write it down, right?

**00:13:27** But in shows where I had three people,

**00:13:29** sometimes two people are doing that, right?

**00:13:30** And that having that real time,

**00:13:32** the self is important.

**00:13:33** So then you don't end up with conflicts

**00:13:35** when it tries to resolve itself in a sink.

**00:13:37** So that kind of suck can be really messy.

**00:13:39** And that is why everybody uses Google docs

**00:13:42** for this type of stuff.

**00:13:43** And so that's why I've always used it

**00:13:45** because it works really great.

**00:13:46** But the experience of using Google docs

**00:13:49** on like a phone or whatever, it's just not that nice.

**00:13:51** You know, like I would like an application.

**00:13:53** It felt better.

**00:13:53** I don't, again, I don't know if word

**00:13:55** is the right app for that either, but yeah.

**00:13:58** This episode of Cortex is brought to you

**00:14:00** by the new season of Wireframe,

**00:14:02** a podcast all about how user experience

**00:14:05** can help technology fit into our lives.

**00:14:07** Wireframe is a show for designers and the design curious,

**00:14:10** hosted by Koi Vinh, senior director of design at Adobe.

**00:14:14** The pandemic has changed our habits and our lives.

**00:14:17** And this season of Wireframe leans into how design

**00:14:19** intersects with these changes.

**00:14:21** So you'll hear stories like how user experience design

**00:14:24** helps people manage stress and sleeplessness,

**00:14:26** or find something good to watch

**00:14:27** on an online streaming service,

**00:14:29** maybe even help individuals, creators,

**00:14:30** and social causes through crowdfunding.

**00:14:33** This is another great one,

**00:14:34** how you can help all the family members understand technology.

**00:14:37** That is an episode that I checked out myself,

**00:14:40** and it's super great actually.

**00:14:42** Really fun and interesting stories

**00:14:43** that relate to helping people in your family with technology,

**00:14:46** which I think is something that we can all relate to

**00:14:48** and is a theme of the entire episode.

**00:14:50** But this episode also focuses on how good design

**00:14:53** can help people get around these issues.

**00:14:56** Like a good user experience can help new users

**00:14:58** from not needing to require the help

**00:15:01** of younger people in their lives.

**00:15:02** If you design something for the people that you want to use it

**00:15:05** and include lots of people in it,

**00:15:07** you'll have a much better experience for your users.

**00:15:10** People shouldn't be left behind

**00:15:11** because technology is getting more and more complicated.

**00:15:13** Anyway, you don't wanna hear me explain the episode.

**00:15:15** You should go listen to it yourself.

**00:15:17** It's really engaging, loads of great interviews.

**00:15:19** You're gonna hear from some seriously impressive designers

**00:15:22** and design leaders who have built UX and UI experiences

**00:15:25** for companies like Headspace, Patreon, Kickstarter,

**00:15:28** and Ythings.

**00:15:29** Whether you're into UX, UI, technology,

**00:15:31** or just curious about the way that design impacts

**00:15:34** our everyday lives, you should check out Wireframe.

**00:15:37** Just search for Wireframe in your favorite podcast app,

**00:15:40** like the one you're using right now,

**00:15:42** or check out the link in the show notes.

**00:15:43** So thanks to Wireframe for their support of Cortex

**00:15:46** and all of Relay-FM.

**00:15:47** Talking about betas, have you installed any of Apple's betas

**00:15:51** on any of your products yet?

**00:15:53** No, I have not.

**00:15:54** Oh, okay, interesting.

**00:15:55** You're held off, all right.

**00:15:57** You were very confident last time,

**00:16:00** but my feeling is I have no need to do this.

**00:16:04** It's fine, I can wait this year.

**00:16:06** I'm not planning on installing any of the betas

**00:16:08** on my devices.

**00:16:09** And, you know, I'm sure also like,

**00:16:14** the thing I'm thinking of,

**00:16:15** and you can tell me if this is true or not,

**00:16:18** you were giving me a real song and dance show last time

**00:16:21** about look at all this magic with shortcuts.

**00:16:24** Look at everything that I have in my hat here,

**00:16:26** like just pulling out these rabbits.

**00:16:28** And while that is amazing,

**00:16:30** the problem with shortcuts in particular

**00:16:33** is installing the beta on one device

**00:16:35** means you're installing the beta

**00:16:37** on every device eventually, right?

**00:16:38** There's the beta spread of the shortcut stuff

**00:16:42** won't work everywhere.

**00:16:43** And so it's like, well,

**00:16:44** if I just started with my loaner iPad,

**00:16:47** then I update some automation

**00:16:48** and now it doesn't work on everything

**00:16:50** where the beta isn't installed.

**00:16:51** And so it just like, it spreads like a virus.

**00:16:54** I haven't had that happen.

**00:16:54** So I'm keeping it.

**00:16:56** I mean, I've installed it on my phone

**00:16:58** because I like the shortcut stuff so much on my iPad

**00:17:01** that I want it on my phone too.

**00:17:03** So I'm running iOS 14 on my iPhone now.

**00:17:05** Okay.

**00:17:06** And this is still the developer beta, right?

**00:17:08** We're not even in public beta.

**00:17:09** Public beta is out now.

**00:17:10** Oh, okay.

**00:17:11** Maybe that's why you didn't do it

**00:17:12** because you didn't know the public beta was out.

**00:17:14** Should've thought of that.

**00:17:16** But yeah, I'm on the developer beta now

**00:17:18** on my iPhone and my iPad,

**00:17:21** but the public beta is available.

**00:17:23** And I cannot wait for September

**00:17:26** for the home screen conversations that we're gonna have.

**00:17:29** Cause they're gonna be big.

**00:17:30** I am one screen now.

**00:17:32** You weren't one screen last time?

**00:17:33** No, I had the second screen with all the stuff on it, right?

**00:17:36** I had no folders on my first screen.

**00:17:38** But now I'm a four by four grid of apps

**00:17:40** and then a large widget.

**00:17:41** And they're just the Apple widgets.

**00:17:42** I know that when I start getting third party widgets,

**00:17:45** even in some, hopefully some betas,

**00:17:47** but like when they come out in the store,

**00:17:49** like I feel like I'm gonna really change up

**00:17:52** a lot of my home screen for a while, if not forever.

**00:17:55** Like there just feels like a lot could happen with it

**00:17:57** and it could be really interesting.

**00:17:59** So I'm excited about that.

**00:18:01** But the thing that I really love is I was just able

**00:18:03** to hide the other two home screens.

**00:18:04** They're gone forever.

**00:18:06** I heard someone say something on a podcast.

**00:18:09** I don't remember where I heard it now.

**00:18:10** And I thought you might like this thought

**00:18:12** because it's so easy to,

**00:18:14** you can have like another home screen

**00:18:16** that you just can long press and then hide it.

**00:18:19** So you could have like a work app home screen.

**00:18:22** Can you explain that?

**00:18:23** I don't know what you mean by this.

**00:18:25** Now you're able to long press on the home screen,

**00:18:27** kind of, you know where you have the dots

**00:18:29** are just above the dock.

**00:18:31** And you go into like a zoomed out view

**00:18:34** almost like expose or mission control on the Mac.

**00:18:38** And you can uncheck home screens that have apps on them.

**00:18:41** Then you hide them.

**00:18:43** That's interesting.

**00:18:44** So this is like how people get rid of their home screens.

**00:18:47** So they just use the app library,

**00:18:49** which is what I've been doing.

**00:18:50** And then apps just installed to the app library.

**00:18:53** And that's it.

**00:18:54** Can you hide the app library?

**00:18:54** No, but you just, it's only there when you swipe for it.

**00:18:57** Oh, okay.

**00:18:58** So you can have a home screen that's just widgets.

**00:19:00** Yeah, you can.

**00:19:01** I think it's actually possible to have a home screen

**00:19:03** with no apps on it now.

**00:19:04** That's interesting.

**00:19:05** I think that you will be a no apps, but widgets person.

**00:19:09** And I think that I might get close to that,

**00:19:11** like just a few apps and then bunch of widgets.

**00:19:14** Yeah, I mean, we'll have to see the thing.

**00:19:17** I mean, part of the reason why I'm also able to so far

**00:19:20** to hold off on the beta is because widgets are

**00:19:22** the most interesting thing.

**00:19:24** And you can't get them for the apps that you want them for.

**00:19:26** Exactly.

**00:19:27** Like everything that I want the widget for,

**00:19:28** I'd have to harass the developers to let me

**00:19:31** into your beta, right?

**00:19:32** And like, that's not gonna happen.

**00:19:33** So I kind of can't play with the most interesting stuff yet.

**00:19:37** And I'll be very curious to see when it's actually out

**00:19:40** and apps start releasing their own widgets.

**00:19:42** But there is a little bit of a question in my mind

**00:19:45** about how much this is going to be a bit like complications

**00:19:49** all over again, where the promise of how potentially

**00:19:53** interesting complications are is much greater

**00:19:56** than the check that is cashed by what complications

**00:19:59** are actually able to do.

**00:20:01** And so I just wonder about that with widgets,

**00:20:03** like six months after the thing comes out

**00:20:06** and we're done playing around with the novelty of widgets.

**00:20:09** Like how useful will they actually be one year from now?

**00:20:13** I'll be interested to see.

**00:20:15** I think the benefit that we have there is that complications

**00:20:18** and Apple watch exist.

**00:20:19** So if you just think of the widgets as big complications,

**00:20:23** that's what they are.

**00:20:24** We already have a sense of what that type of UI is like.

**00:20:28** You have UI that it shows you information

**00:20:30** and you tap on it and it just opens the app.

**00:20:33** That's what these widgets do.

**00:20:35** So we have an idea of it already,

**00:20:37** but just seeing some of the designs that developers

**00:20:40** that I follow on Twitter are putting out there

**00:20:42** for things that they're working on,

**00:20:44** I'm like, oh yeah, you know what?

**00:20:45** I would quite, I think I would quite like that.

**00:20:47** Or even just like little things like Apple's weather

**00:20:50** and calendar widgets are like, oh yeah,

**00:20:53** I really want these for fantastic current carat weather.

**00:20:56** And that's going to be amazing.

**00:20:57** You know, so this is,

**00:20:58** there's just like little parts of it where I'm like,

**00:21:00** having that widget is so much better than the app icon

**00:21:05** because I get what I want to open the app for

**00:21:08** like 90% of the time, right?

**00:21:10** I'm opening carat weather to find out

**00:21:12** what the temperature is right now,

**00:21:13** or I'm opening fantastic L to see what events

**00:21:15** I have for the day.

**00:21:17** Or the widgets would just show me that information.

**00:21:19** It will be really nice.

**00:21:20** And I'm really happy that we're finally going to have it

**00:21:22** in this way because developers could have done stuff

**00:21:26** and have done stuff like this already.

**00:21:27** Like there is already a fantastic car widget

**00:21:29** and a carat weather widget over in the today view,

**00:21:33** but it's just not the same when it's like hidden away

**00:21:35** in this other place.

**00:21:37** Having it on your home screen,

**00:21:38** it's like, as soon as you unlock your phone, it's there.

**00:21:40** And what I've liked about the ones that I'm seeing is

**00:21:43** they're also just there even when I'm not looking for them.

**00:21:46** So I feel like I just have that information at hand more.

**00:21:49** Right, it's ambient awareness of things which can be useful.

**00:21:53** So, and then what I really like is that

**00:21:55** when you put them in these stacks,

**00:21:57** you can layer them on top of each other.

**00:21:58** You can have the phone try and be smart

**00:22:01** and rotate them through today to show you what you want.

**00:22:03** And I have found that serious suggestion type stuff

**00:22:06** to actually be pretty typically quite good for me

**00:22:08** in the past, like the serious suggestion of apps.

**00:22:11** So like, you know, when you pull down

**00:22:12** and it shows you what apps you might want to be using,

**00:22:15** that's always worked pretty well.

**00:22:16** Yeah, I agree.

**00:22:17** I agree.

**00:22:18** That works better than you think it will.

**00:22:19** Yeah, and I expect this is gonna be a very similar

**00:22:21** kind of logic for the widgets, right?

**00:22:23** Of like understanding what you might want to be looking at

**00:22:26** at a different time of day is probably pretty similar

**00:22:29** to what apps are my opening on a certain times of day.

**00:22:32** And also like I always really liked the Siri watch face.

**00:22:36** Rest in peace, it's still there,

**00:22:37** but it just never got changed.

**00:22:39** But I like that because it did a good job for me

**00:22:42** showing me what I wanted to see.

**00:22:44** And again, I expect the widget rotation

**00:22:46** to be a similar idea to that as well.

**00:22:48** I remember whatever that was a couple of WWDCs ago,

**00:22:52** when you were really harping on like,

**00:22:54** this is the future of watch OS.

**00:22:56** I really thought it was.

**00:22:58** You had very good reasons.

**00:23:00** And I think made a compelling argument for,

**00:23:02** yeah, this is gonna be the future of watch OS.

**00:23:04** And then just like with so many things,

**00:23:07** like, oh, it came out and is never touched again.

**00:23:12** It really felt like it to me,

**00:23:14** like it really did.

**00:23:15** And I was so wrong because they really did not do anything

**00:23:20** with it ever again.

**00:23:21** Yeah, you wonder sometimes like, what's the deal?

**00:23:23** Like what's the internal story with that of,

**00:23:26** it seemed like such a great idea with so much potential.

**00:23:29** And then just, oh, it's gonna sit untouched for years

**00:23:31** and no one's going to make complications for it

**00:23:34** because it's the only one that can do this.

**00:23:37** Now with the shortcut stuff that you were telling me

**00:23:39** about automating changing the watch faces is like,

**00:23:42** that Siri watch face is done.

**00:23:44** Sorry, like that is totally gone now.

**00:23:47** I'm not planning on installing the watch beta on my watch.

**00:23:51** I mean, I may as well

**00:23:52** because I don't wear the watch that much,

**00:23:54** but it's just not how I'm at least right now.

**00:23:56** That is the only thing that has annoyed me

**00:23:58** since you told me about it is the ability to say,

**00:24:01** change a watch face at a particular day

**00:24:03** or at a particular time.

**00:24:04** And now every time at night,

**00:24:06** I manually swipe over to my nighttime watch face.

**00:24:10** I'm a little annoyed.

**00:24:11** I'm like milling my own grain here.

**00:24:14** Like I don't understand why I have to swipe this over.

**00:24:17** So if anything's gonna get me for the beta,

**00:24:19** it's something like that of just the continual annoyance of,

**00:24:23** I shouldn't have to do this.

**00:24:26** Like it's eight o'clock, switch over to the nighttime face.

**00:24:30** Just do it.

**00:24:32** I've also spent a little bit of time in Mac OS 11.

**00:24:35** Oh, okay.

**00:24:36** I just assumed that you would not have installed

**00:24:38** the Mac beta because,

**00:24:42** let me guess, you're not running it

**00:24:43** on the production machine right now, of course.

**00:24:45** No, I'm not even running it on a computer that's mine.

**00:24:48** Oh, okay.

**00:24:49** You stole someone's computer?

**00:24:50** No, some time ago,

**00:24:51** Apple sent me a review unit of a MacBook Pro.

**00:24:54** Ooh, fancy, fancy man.

**00:24:56** This was ages ago.

**00:24:58** Honestly, like, I think I really like it.

**00:25:01** You really like the beta?

**00:25:02** The way it looks, like I like the new look a lot.

**00:25:05** Yeah, I mean, I've only seen it in the screenshots,

**00:25:07** but it seems intriguing.

**00:25:08** I've never minded flatter design.

**00:25:10** Like as a general statement,

**00:25:12** I think flat design is a safe, solid,

**00:25:15** and also interesting way to go for things.

**00:25:17** I've forgotten what transparency was like.

**00:25:20** Did you turn off transparency on your machines?

**00:25:22** Or what do you mean by that?

**00:25:23** I've had transparency off on my computers

**00:25:26** since Apple introduced transparency to the OS.

**00:25:29** Right.

**00:25:30** So when I turned it on,

**00:25:32** I was like, what the is going on?

**00:25:35** Right. Like, why can I see my wallpaper everywhere?

**00:25:38** Because they've have,

**00:25:39** they seem to have made it a little bit more aggressive anyway,

**00:25:41** but it was like a big surprise to me

**00:25:43** because I had not seen that in a very long time.

**00:25:47** Just had to open up on my computer.

**00:25:48** I couldn't even remember.

**00:25:49** I was like, oh yes, I too have reduced transparency on.

**00:25:53** Like what happens if I uncheck that?

**00:25:54** Oh, nothing happens because my background

**00:25:56** is just a dark gray background.

**00:25:58** So nothing looks different.

**00:25:59** You wouldn't even know.

**00:26:01** Quick time gets ever so slightly darker

**00:26:04** if I uncheck that button.

**00:26:05** And that is the only thing as far as I can tell.

**00:26:08** But yeah, like overall,

**00:26:09** the look of it just feels fresh and modern

**00:26:12** in a way that macOS is not for like the last 10 years,

**00:26:15** in my opinion.

**00:26:16** Yeah. I mean, this is based on nothing

**00:26:19** except just the visual look of it.

**00:26:21** But having seen the screenshots,

**00:26:24** it does make me really wonder about Apple's statements

**00:26:27** of like, oh guys,

**00:26:28** we're never going to merge everything

**00:26:29** into one operating system.

**00:26:31** Like we have no plans to do that.

**00:26:34** We're just going to make them more and more similar

**00:26:37** to each other with each following year, right?

**00:26:40** But they're never going to merge.

**00:26:41** That's crazy talk.

**00:26:43** If it's here at a certain point,

**00:26:44** you don't need to merge them

**00:26:46** if the application platform's the same.

**00:26:49** And I think that's what they're going for is like,

**00:26:51** the application platform is the same across all of them,

**00:26:54** right?

**00:26:55** You write it in Swift UI and write in Swift

**00:26:57** and it can run everywhere.

**00:26:59** And then they can still have things like the terminal,

**00:27:02** but then they never have to bring terminal to iPad.

**00:27:04** Right, right.

**00:27:05** So like I've actually come around recently

**00:27:07** on the idea of like,

**00:27:08** I do believe they will keep them separate for a long time,

**00:27:11** but the things that third parties can make,

**00:27:14** they're going to be the same.

**00:27:15** It'll be the same everywhere.

**00:27:16** Or it can be.

**00:27:17** Yeah.

**00:27:18** But Apple can still like,

**00:27:20** have these distinct operating systems for a while.

**00:27:23** I see what you're saying,

**00:27:24** but that strikes me as like,

**00:27:25** a distinction without a difference

**00:27:27** in the same way that,

**00:27:28** oh, there's iOS and there's iPadOS.

**00:27:32** Yeah, and they do different things,

**00:27:33** but they're still the same.

**00:27:34** Yeah, it's like, yeah, sure.

**00:27:36** I get what you're saying,

**00:27:37** but it doesn't matter.

**00:27:40** I think the way that they say like,

**00:27:41** we'll never merge the platforms

**00:27:43** is heard and interpreted in people's brains

**00:27:47** in an entirely different way

**00:27:49** from what Apple's obvious plans actually are

**00:27:52** of like everything the same everywhere.

**00:27:55** That is very clearly our ultimate plan.

**00:27:58** Oh, look at the maps in these presentations.

**00:28:01** There's clearly not being designed

**00:28:03** to also be the same for our future

**00:28:05** augmented reality platform.

**00:28:06** Like everything is coming together to be the same

**00:28:09** and that's clearly what they're doing.

**00:28:11** I mean, I don't know what the temperature online is

**00:28:14** for the redesign, but like, I don't mind it.

**00:28:16** It looks nice having not actually experienced it myself.

**00:28:19** Are you okay with it?

**00:28:20** Like you like it?

**00:28:21** Yeah, I really like it.

**00:28:22** I really like it.

**00:28:23** It looks interesting to me

**00:28:24** and it looks like the type of operating system

**00:28:28** that I am more familiar with

**00:28:29** and comfortable with and prefer, right?

**00:28:31** It looks a lot like iPadOS in places.

**00:28:34** And I think that that's a really good idea personally

**00:28:36** because you can freshen things up,

**00:28:38** give people that are less familiar with the Mac platform,

**00:28:42** more familiarity with the Mac platform.

**00:28:44** I think that it's clever

**00:28:46** and I think it's especially clever

**00:28:47** as they're moving into these Apple Silicon Macs

**00:28:51** with iOS apps that can run on these machines

**00:28:54** and if that's the thing that they wanna do

**00:28:56** and I think will be a thing that they will consider

**00:28:58** to be a serious benefit,

**00:29:00** having a lot of the operating system around it

**00:29:02** be a little bit more reminiscent of the place

**00:29:04** where those applications are native might be a good idea.

**00:29:08** Should I put the beta on my laptop?

**00:29:10** No.

**00:29:11** No?

**00:29:11** No.

**00:29:12** You don't want me to have it on the production machine?

**00:29:14** Wait.

**00:29:14** I thought you were trying to push these betas on me.

**00:29:15** Do you record from a laptop?

**00:29:18** Yeah, I do record from a laptop right now.

**00:29:19** Okay.

**00:29:21** Oh, there he goes.

**00:29:22** Wait, what do you mean?

**00:29:23** What do you mean there he goes?

**00:29:25** You moved away.

**00:29:26** I can hear you moving away.

**00:29:28** Yeah, because I'm looking at the laptop.

**00:29:30** I was looking at the laptop.

**00:29:32** Would you check that it was there?

**00:29:33** What would you not know?

**00:29:34** I don't know, because I was talking about it

**00:29:35** so I just had to go look at it.

**00:29:38** But no, in my division between standing desk

**00:29:41** and sitting desk in my eternal home office now,

**00:29:45** it's ended up that my iMac is at the standing desk

**00:29:49** and my sitting desk, which is the podcast desk,

**00:29:52** has a laptop with a screen attached to it.

**00:29:54** Look, I've got so much.

**00:29:55** I bought one of those crazy external,

**00:29:58** what do you call it, the eGPUs?

**00:30:01** Wait.

**00:30:01** I've got a huge eGPU that's connected

**00:30:03** to the little laptop.

**00:30:04** Another one, because you went through this before

**00:30:06** and you had all that trouble with the USB-C cable.

**00:30:09** Yeah, no, we've been looking for it.

**00:30:11** Look, I've been going totally crazy in my home office

**00:30:15** trying to get the setups just right.

**00:30:19** And I eventually had to cave

**00:30:21** because the laptop running an external display,

**00:30:23** it slows it down and I did have to go back

**00:30:25** to doing the eGPU and I had used the Blackmagic one

**00:30:29** forever ago, but it was super wimpy

**00:30:31** and didn't really help a lot.

**00:30:33** So I ended up getting one of these like

**00:30:36** Razer Core Chroma enormous eGPU things

**00:30:40** and then got one of those like GPUs

**00:30:43** that has three fans on it and stick it inside

**00:30:45** and try to make it work.

**00:30:46** And so I've tried to beef up my sitting down working station.

**00:30:52** Oh, you're such a gamer.

**00:30:54** Oh my God.

**00:30:54** Do you have RGB on your eGPU?

**00:30:57** You do, don't you?

**00:30:59** Yes, there is RGB on my eGPU.

**00:31:02** Yeah, what a gamer.

**00:31:04** So I thought you might enjoy that.

**00:31:05** Yeah, I do enjoy that.

**00:31:07** Oh man, that's amazing.

**00:31:09** Anyway, all this is to answer your question.

**00:31:10** Like, yes, I am recording on a laptop right now,

**00:31:13** but I've tried to beef it up because I presume

**00:31:17** that you don't want me recording at my standing desk

**00:31:21** that has a treadmill underneath it

**00:31:22** while we're doing podcasts.

**00:31:23** Do you have a treadmill desk?

**00:31:25** Yeah, didn't I tell you this?

**00:31:26** No, I don't know about this.

**00:31:28** I guess this is, here's the big problem

**00:31:30** that I keep having is I just have no sense of time

**00:31:35** or I don't know how to like,

**00:31:39** if you measure something at two points in time,

**00:31:42** there's a difference between them.

**00:31:44** So like, oh, what did my office look like six months ago

**00:31:46** versus what did it look like now?

**00:31:48** Because I have no sense of time,

**00:31:50** I have no sense of the ability to understand like,

**00:31:54** what is the differential between previous times

**00:31:57** that we have spoken and now?

**00:31:59** And so when a piece of equipment comes into my office,

**00:32:01** I have this feeling of like,

**00:32:02** has it been here for two days

**00:32:04** or has it always been here, right?

**00:32:06** Like I have no idea anymore.

**00:32:09** Did it come with a house?

**00:32:11** Yeah, like this is also why I'm very confident

**00:32:14** that I won't actually put the betas on any of my devices

**00:32:17** because since every single day is the same as the day

**00:32:20** that came before it and I have no sense of time,

**00:32:22** new phones and the final operating system will be here

**00:32:26** before I have any subjective sense of time passing at all.

**00:32:30** So I think I really am gonna skip it this year.

**00:32:33** But no, I've got so much stuff in my office.

**00:32:35** Now I don't have any idea like what you know is here

**00:32:37** and what you, I have a boom arm.

**00:32:39** Do you know I'm recording on a boom arm?

**00:32:40** I know you wanted that.

**00:32:41** Oh my God.

**00:32:42** Did I know that?

**00:32:44** I feel like maybe.

**00:32:45** See, you have the same problem too.

**00:32:47** But yeah, I have a boom arm.

**00:32:49** Yeah, we went through it because you were banging on the desk

**00:32:51** and it sounded good.

**00:32:52** Yeah, I remember that.

**00:32:53** Yes, that's right.

**00:32:54** Yeah, so I have a boom arm.

**00:32:55** The boom arm as a bonus point is actually connected

**00:32:58** to the standing desk so that it's not even possible

**00:33:01** for vibrations at the sitting desk to make it

**00:33:03** to the standing desk into the microphone.

**00:33:06** So it's like, it's perfect isolation.

**00:33:08** Oh wait, hang on a second.

**00:33:09** Hang on a second.

**00:33:10** I have to map this one out in my brain

**00:33:11** because the way I had imagined this was very different

**00:33:13** to how you've described it.

**00:33:15** So you're sitting standing desk next to each other.

**00:33:18** Yes, there are two desks.

**00:33:19** They're next to each other.

**00:33:21** One is a standing desk.

**00:33:22** One is a sitting desk.

**00:33:24** I'm sitting at the sitting desk,

**00:33:26** but the boom arm is connected to the standing desk

**00:33:29** so that the microphone then comes down

**00:33:31** and is in front of me because that just,

**00:33:33** the way everything's arranged,

**00:33:34** that ends up being the nice place for it to be.

**00:33:36** Can I ask why you didn't consider a sit stand desk?

**00:33:39** Okay, so the reason I didn't consider a sit stand desk

**00:33:43** is that the tre-

**00:33:44** Okay, so I bought a treadmill-

**00:33:45** Because of the treadmill.

**00:33:46** To go with the standing desk, right?

**00:33:47** Because of the treadmill.

**00:33:49** Where's the treadmill gonna go?

**00:33:50** Where's the chair gonna go?

**00:33:52** Exactly.

**00:33:52** The treadmill is one of those ones in theory.

**00:33:54** You can put it up against the wall, but in practice-

**00:33:56** No one's gonna do that.

**00:33:57** Yeah, you don't wanna ever actually do that.

**00:33:59** I could've sworn I told you about it, but anyway, yeah.

**00:34:01** So the treadmill desk has been by far and away

**00:34:04** one of the best quarantine purchases.

**00:34:06** And I usually spend like at least two hours a day on it,

**00:34:10** like while I'm working and stuff.

**00:34:12** So what are you, are you walking?

**00:34:13** Yeah, I set it for walking

**00:34:15** and then I'm writing while I'm doing that.

**00:34:16** So it's taken the place of pacing back and forth

**00:34:20** in the office a little bit is to be on the treadmill.

**00:34:22** And also for light editing,

**00:34:28** for either doing like audio or video editing,

**00:34:30** as long as it's not too precise,

**00:34:32** I can be on the treadmill desk and do that as well.

**00:34:35** It's very much a core part of,

**00:34:38** don't let your muscles atrophy away during quarantine time

**00:34:42** has been get on the treadmill desk every day

**00:34:45** and do part of your work there.

**00:34:48** But yeah, so anyway, I could've sworn I told you about that,

**00:34:50** but obviously I didn't and I have no sense of time.

**00:34:52** And all of this was to say,

**00:34:55** you don't want me walking while recording the podcast.

**00:34:58** I think you wouldn't enjoy that.

**00:35:00** No, I wouldn't enjoy that.

**00:35:01** That would be quite disruptive, I think.

**00:35:05** But I guess it's good because I know you would pace, right?

**00:35:08** And now you don't, now maybe you, do you get that feeling?

**00:35:12** Does it feel like the same thing

**00:35:14** if you're walking on the desk to pacing?

**00:35:16** It's not quite the same, but it's fine.

**00:35:18** Just with deciding like,

**00:35:19** I need to have this treadmill desk

**00:35:20** so that I have the option of working while moving

**00:35:23** has reduced the space just enough in the office

**00:35:27** that there really isn't enough space to pace

**00:35:29** without spending 30% of the time

**00:35:32** in the turning around moment, which is no good, right?

**00:35:36** It's walking in a circle.

**00:35:38** Yeah, there's a ratio of how much length of walking

**00:35:42** do you get versus time spent turning around

**00:35:44** and you don't want the turnaround frequency

**00:35:46** to be every five seconds.

**00:35:48** You're basically just using one leg, right?

**00:35:51** Yes, exactly.

**00:35:53** Just go around in a circle that way.

**00:35:54** So standing desk with treadmill, highly recommend,

**00:35:59** has almost certainly prevented my legs

**00:36:01** from becoming just vestigial organs during the lockdown.

**00:37:19** I have a little secret.

**00:37:21** What's your secret?

**00:37:21** Do you have a treadmill desk?

**00:37:22** No, I don't have a treadmill desk.

**00:37:24** I am not recording at home today.

**00:37:26** Oh, are you out?

**00:37:29** Are you in your office, your outside office?

**00:37:33** I'm in Mega Studio.

**00:37:34** You're in Mega Studio.

**00:37:36** This is the very first podcast recorded from Mega Studio.

**00:37:39** Oh, wow.

**00:37:40** Yep.

**00:37:41** I thought it felt special to me to give Cortex that.

**00:37:43** I was going to say that genuinely feels like a really big honor.

**00:37:47** Well, it feels like the right place, right?

**00:37:49** Like the whole, I think like the Mega name came from the show

**00:37:53** and like I've been chronicling the studio on this show.

**00:37:57** It felt like the, so I would say, you know, people may notice

**00:38:00** that I sound a little different because I might sound a little different

**00:38:02** because there's an echo still in here a little bit.

**00:38:05** I reckon I'm like 80% there, right?

**00:38:09** Like there's still more to do, but I'm at the point

**00:38:11** where I feel like it's good enough.

**00:38:13** Like I feel like the echo in here or like the level of quality of audio

**00:38:19** I can get here is about what I would get or what I feel possible

**00:38:23** when I'm in like a hotel room or something.

**00:38:25** And I've recorded many episodes of Cortex from hotel rooms.

**00:38:28** So I thought to myself, I feel good about it.

**00:38:30** Like I want to give it a go.

**00:38:32** There's a couple of things more that we want to do

**00:38:34** that we still haven't done, which I think will continue to reduce the echo in here.

**00:38:39** But I'm really pleased with the lengths that we've gone to to make it doable.

**00:38:46** So I figured maybe now's the time and I'll find out in editing

**00:38:50** just how it sounds, I suppose.

**00:38:53** Like I've been doing tests.

**00:38:54** Listen, I guarantee you, no one noticed that anything sounded different.

**00:39:00** Until I shouted echo.

**00:39:01** Well, yeah.

**00:39:03** But even then, people wouldn't notice.

**00:39:05** And unless people at this point will be like, oh, I totally know this.

**00:39:10** I knew all the time.

**00:39:11** It's like that time when we recorded two episodes back to back and said,

**00:39:14** haha, nobody knew.

**00:39:16** And then some people were like, I can tell, but no one knew.

**00:39:18** No one knew.

**00:39:20** Exactly.

**00:39:21** And it's like unless you left a comment before you got to this part of the podcast,

**00:39:28** you didn't really know.

**00:39:30** It's the same way that people trick themselves when they're doing flash cards

**00:39:32** to learn something new and like you can constantly trick yourself into thinking

**00:39:36** you've given the correct answer.

**00:39:38** But it's like, no, no, say it out loud before you look at the back of the card.

**00:39:42** And then you'll find out if you really know what the back of the card says.

**00:39:45** You know, this is the same thing.

**00:39:47** So I guarantee you, no one will have noticed.

**00:39:50** You could have recorded from Mega Studio for a year and there would never have been

**00:39:55** a peep from anyone about, oh, does Mike sound different?

**00:39:59** His echo seems to be 10% more present than it was when he was working from home.

**00:40:05** So don't worry about that.

**00:40:06** But congratulations on being in Mega Studio.

**00:40:09** That's a big thing to actually be there.

**00:40:11** Like is the plan to be recording from here going forward now?

**00:40:15** No.

**00:40:15** OK.

**00:40:16** No.

**00:40:17** My thinking is I will start doing more because frankly, like I just am not right

**00:40:24** now thinking that I will be here all the time.

**00:40:27** We're still limiting how much time we're out of the home because it's a whole to do.

**00:40:32** Right.

**00:40:33** So I went to get a coffee before we started this show.

**00:40:35** And like this, I got, you know, like I bring the coffee into the studio and then I have

**00:40:39** to use the hand sanitizer and then the alcohol wipe on the coffee.

**00:40:43** Like it's like a whole.

**00:40:44** Right.

**00:40:45** It's too much of a to do for this to be all the time.

**00:40:49** You know, but I'm slowly thinking that I will increase because as well, like those

**00:40:54** things I've just explained, they're just going to become more and more things that

**00:40:57** I'm used to.

**00:40:58** So like maybe there'll be less of a thing that annoy me.

**00:41:00** You know what I mean?

**00:41:01** Because, you know, I mentioned about the quarantine zone and we didn't have any of

**00:41:04** that set.

**00:41:06** Well, like we've got that now with like a home in our hallway.

**00:41:10** So nothing will go past this part of the hallway.

**00:41:12** Right.

**00:41:13** Right.

**00:41:13** Yes.

**00:41:13** It's here.

**00:41:14** And then we can walk like, you know, like nobody touches anything.

**00:41:17** Shoes come off like all that kind of stuff.

**00:41:19** Right.

**00:41:20** And we didn't have any of that like set up here as like, well, this is how that

**00:41:24** operates.

**00:41:25** But now we do like a dinner book, colored tape.

**00:41:27** And she drew a box on the ground.

**00:41:29** Nothing leaves this box.

**00:41:31** Right.

**00:41:31** Right.

**00:41:31** You come in, we have hand sanitizer on every desk.

**00:41:35** We have alcohol wipes and we have like food containers and bags.

**00:41:39** They will stay here and then the stuff will be taken out like seeing that just doing what

**00:41:43** you do now.

**00:41:44** Right.

**00:41:44** But we didn't have any of that set up here.

**00:41:46** So it wasn't really working.

**00:41:49** But like we've got that in place.

**00:41:50** And now we've got that in place.

**00:41:52** We're like, OK, we feel like we understand the transition from outside to into the

**00:41:56** studio now.

**00:41:58** But then it was like, well, all of the things that I planned on bringing here

**00:42:03** computer wise, I can't do any of it.

**00:42:05** So I'm not bringing my iMac here because one, I'm not going to be recording from

**00:42:09** here all the time.

**00:42:11** And two, even if I decided I was, that's not the machine I want to have to bring

**00:42:16** home in a hurry if we lock down again.

**00:42:19** Right.

**00:42:19** Right.

**00:42:20** That thing is going to go in a moving van when we eventually move all of the studio

**00:42:25** here.

**00:42:25** Right.

**00:42:26** And then it was like, well, but I had always planned that I would do my recording

**00:42:29** from a laptop, but I'm not buying a laptop right now for many reasons.

**00:42:34** Like the main one of them being like, if I'm buying an Apple laptop in the next six

**00:42:38** months, I want it to have an Apple silicon chip in it because why not?

**00:42:42** Right.

**00:42:42** Yeah.

**00:42:43** I don't really think that the effect is large, but I can imagine that there's a

**00:42:48** significant number of people where the moment Apple said we're making our own

**00:42:54** chips, all computer purchases are ceased.

**00:42:57** Yeah.

**00:42:57** Of course.

**00:42:58** Like I know I'm in that category of like, I'm going to wait.

**00:43:02** Right.

**00:43:02** I don't care how long it takes.

**00:43:03** I'm not buying another Intel computer if I can possibly, possibly avoid it.

**00:43:08** It is really, it's because like the Apple silicon chips are going to be interesting

**00:43:12** potentially in so many ways in these laptops.

**00:43:14** I will want one so I can talk about it on one shows.

**00:43:18** I'm not going to buy two laptops.

**00:43:19** Okay.

**00:43:20** So like that's going to wait.

**00:43:22** But what I have done is I have for a few years now, I think I've had a Mac mini at

**00:43:26** home, just performing some like home server type tasks.

**00:43:31** So I brought it here.

**00:43:32** It can do all of those things for me.

**00:43:34** I can still VNC into it from home if I want to, but that Mac mini is now here.

**00:43:39** I had to buy a monitor because couldn't get the one from you.

**00:43:44** You're right.

**00:43:44** Yeah.

**00:43:44** We never, we never quite figured out how, how this transport is going to happen.

**00:43:48** Well, I just think because we are, we agreed to this LG drug deal before the

**00:43:53** pandemic, right?

**00:43:56** And then at that point I was like, well, I'm, I know I'm not seeing gray for a long

**00:44:00** time and I figured if I see you for any reason, the primary reason is not going

**00:44:05** to be because I want to get a monitor from you.

**00:44:08** Right.

**00:44:08** That's just not really high on my list.

**00:44:10** Yes.

**00:44:11** Would you like to try to transport this home on a train right now?

**00:44:14** Yeah.

**00:44:14** Not really.

**00:44:15** So I bought a Dell monitor.

**00:44:18** It's like one of the Dell, I think they're called ultra sharp monitors.

**00:44:22** And this is mainly because those LGs are really hard to get right now in the UK.

**00:44:27** Cause I was going to get one of the LG monitors just, just because then I didn't

**00:44:30** have to think about, will this be supported properly?

**00:44:33** Right.

**00:44:33** Because I couldn't get one.

**00:44:34** I had, I had to do the research I didn't want to do and found out that the monitor

**00:44:38** that I was going to get was going to be good.

**00:44:40** And this, it's great.

**00:44:41** Like it looks great.

**00:44:41** It's got all of the ports on it that I want and it's on a VESA arm here on the

**00:44:45** desk, which is fantastic.

**00:44:46** I love having the monitor off the desk and like the arm is way back, which it

**00:44:51** wouldn't be if it was an iMac, right?

**00:44:53** Like I'd have to have it closer to me and I have more flexibility with it.

**00:44:56** I can lift it up.

**00:44:57** I can move it around and I'm really happy with that.

**00:44:59** So that's kind of where I am with the desk.

**00:45:02** And I've got most of the things set up.

**00:45:03** I had to buy some extra peripherals.

**00:45:05** Like I got a new Wacom tablet and stuff like that for this desk, which is stuff

**00:45:09** I would have bought anyway.

**00:45:11** Cause what I'm trying to do is at the moment is not to get things that won't

**00:45:15** be used.

**00:45:16** So like my expectation is at some point Apple will release a new monitor, which

**00:45:21** I will want for this desk, but then Adina will then have this Dell for her desk.

**00:45:26** Right.

**00:45:26** Right.

**00:45:26** You're, you're planning the pass me down path of, of electronics.

**00:45:30** Exactly.

**00:45:30** And also like all of the gear that I'm using here is my travel gear.

**00:45:36** Right.

**00:45:36** So it's stuff I already had because I'm in this in between.

**00:45:40** I don't want to buy things technology wise that adjust for the in between because

**00:45:44** that's not the way that this thing will be used in the future.

**00:45:47** So, so yeah, I'm, I'm pretty happy with where we're at.

**00:45:50** This is obviously uncomfortable enough to be recording this show.

**00:45:53** There's more to do.

**00:45:54** I've realized that I've kind of to be able to get this place to where I wanted.

**00:45:58** I have had to let go of some of my aesthetic ideals for the studio.

**00:46:03** Well, yes.

**00:46:04** What, one of the things I've been waiting to ask you for is send me a picture of

**00:46:07** where you're recording from.

**00:46:08** Like I want to see what the setup looks like right now.

**00:46:11** Well, okay.

**00:46:11** I can send you some, uh, I mean, you've seen like the, the, the little kind of

**00:46:15** room I constructed for myself, uh, the blankets, yeah, it's different when

**00:46:19** you're actually there and you're really recording in it, like, I want to see

**00:46:22** what it looks like right now.

**00:46:23** Like, what is it?

**00:46:23** What does Mike's recording setup look like?

**00:46:26** So I send you a picture of my desk.

**00:46:28** When I meet like the aesthetic ideas thing that I'm talking about is for like

**00:46:31** having this, you know, this little room constructed of big blankets and dividers.

**00:46:36** Right.

**00:46:36** Mm-hmm.

**00:46:38** But I've decided that I kind of just have to, to let go of that a little bit, you

**00:46:41** know, because this thing has to add its core be functional and I can make the

**00:46:46** rest of the studio, like be comfortable and look the way that I want it to be.

**00:46:51** But this recording area, it has to be fit for purpose.

**00:46:54** And if that means I have to have these really ugly blankets hanging to my, each

**00:46:59** side of the desk, then that's just the way it's going to have to be.

**00:47:02** They seem fine though.

**00:47:03** Like it seems like a perfectly fine setup to have those two on either side.

**00:47:07** Yeah.

**00:47:07** I don't know.

**00:47:07** It kind of works with the bricks behind it.

**00:47:09** Yeah.

**00:47:09** And you'll notice that I'm struggling to get those sound panels to stick to the

**00:47:13** walls.

**00:47:15** Well, yes, the sound panels, you have a sad sound panel that's fallen off the

**00:47:19** wall.

**00:47:19** There should be three of them.

**00:47:19** I put all three of them up.

**00:47:21** Ah, okay.

**00:47:21** That makes a lot more sense.

**00:47:23** And then we came back, first time we came back after the lockdown, two of them had

**00:47:26** fallen off the wall.

**00:47:27** The one on the left has somehow managed to stay on the wall.

**00:47:31** They're light.

**00:47:32** These panels are actually quite light, but they have these large kind of velcro

**00:47:37** strips on them that have an adhesive on the back and I stuck them on the walls

**00:47:41** and they were fine.

**00:47:42** Didn't really think about the fact that these brick walls are very uneven.

**00:47:46** Yeah.

**00:47:46** The, those 3M adhesives are not going to work on a brick wall.

**00:47:49** No, that's not going to happen.

**00:47:51** Well, I didn't really pay attention to about the fact is that the wall behind me

**00:47:54** is just a flat wall and really my desk should have been against that wall.

**00:47:59** Then it would have been better.

**00:48:00** So maybe I'll move it at some point or, you know, I'll do what I can do and just

**00:48:03** haven't done, which is to just drill some screws into the wall and hang them up

**00:48:07** that way, but we have, we have yet to really work out the way.

**00:48:11** This is what I'm talking about when I'm like, I'm like 80% of the way there.

**00:48:14** It's like, I have these sound panels.

**00:48:15** They just all haven't gone up yet.

**00:48:17** I have these sound panels.

**00:48:18** They're just not absorbing any sound in their current position.

**00:48:21** They may be absorbing sound, but just not the way that I need them to absorb the

**00:48:24** sound, right?

**00:48:25** Like they're pointing in the wrong places.

**00:48:27** And then I'm going to, the last thing I think we're going to do that will probably

**00:48:29** be the only thing left to do is to like hang something from above.

**00:48:34** We're going to bring like a professional in and just like hang these things

**00:48:38** called like clouds or something just above me.

**00:48:42** Cause that's where the echo, the only echo that's left now is just right above

**00:48:46** my head.

**00:48:47** Um, and then when that's done, I'll be happy.

**00:48:50** And ultimately this is still more better for me for more.

**00:48:54** What I want then to put a room in this studio, which was a thing that many

**00:48:58** people recommended and a thing that I considered and looked into, right?

**00:49:01** To get a soundproof room and put it in the studio.

**00:49:04** And I really didn't want to do that because I didn't like the idea and I still

**00:49:08** don't like the idea of like being in this little box because plus I can

**00:49:12** be gruesome in the summer.

**00:49:15** And I, and I really, you know, I, I left a small room to get a big studio.

**00:49:24** I don't want to get a big studio and then go into a small room inside of the big

**00:49:27** studio because even though I have these like curtains to my side or whatever, I

**00:49:32** still feel like I'm part of this bigger space and I'm just, I just don't really

**00:49:37** like the idea of it and, and I, you know, and I'm having had all the research done

**00:49:42** and everything, like I'm pretty happy with where we've gotten to.

**00:49:45** And we just have that one last thing to do.

**00:49:47** And then I think we're pretty set and then I'll be good to record from here.

**00:49:50** And then once I'm really comfortable with that, I can start being here all the

**00:49:54** time and it will be fantastic.

**00:49:56** Well, it's really exciting that you're there and recording this first episode.

**00:50:00** I'm so happy.

**00:50:01** It just feels like it's got that effect that, you know, I don't know how long this

**00:50:07** effect will last, but probably quite a while of like, I feel productive when I'm

**00:50:11** here, you know, like, because I have this mentality of like, and I always felt this

**00:50:17** way when I would do co-work and stuff like that, like if I've left the house to

**00:50:21** come to this place, I should just get the work done.

**00:50:25** Mm-hmm.

**00:50:25** Otherwise I might all be at home.

**00:50:27** If I'm not going to do the work, don't be here.

**00:50:29** Go home.

**00:50:30** Yes.

**00:50:30** So when I'm here, I'm like, I'm, I'm getting more work done.

**00:50:35** There is always like, um, this is a sort of Hawthorne effect where it's like, oh,

**00:50:39** just having done something differently and improves your productivity.

**00:50:42** Like that, that always is the case, especially in the situation you are in

**00:50:46** where you're paying the rent for this to be the office, which is supposed to be

**00:50:51** like the production core of the most valuable work that you do.

**00:50:56** Keeping that foremost in your mind, I think is, is really helpful.

**00:51:00** And the most important part of that is recognizing like, yeah, if you're not

**00:51:05** getting work done, get out of there, right?

**00:51:07** Just like accept that fact and just go and try to keep it like a holy

**00:51:12** place where you're, where you're doing your work.

**00:51:14** I think I'll be able to do that.

**00:51:15** Like, and I have a comfortable area here, but it's still to be worked in.

**00:51:22** Cause not all of my work needs to be at desks.

**00:51:25** Sometimes I'm just reading stuff and I would like somewhere comfortable to sit to

**00:51:29** read, but like being in this space just has a different feel to it.

**00:51:33** It doesn't feel like my home at all.

**00:51:36** And that was the whole point of getting this place in the, in the first place.

**00:51:40** It was like having somewhere out of home where I can come and get my work done

**00:51:44** and then go home and then there's no more work done.

**00:51:46** Hmm.

**00:51:47** When I initially decided this, we were like, the world is very different.

**00:51:53** And even though I was working at home, I was also leaving my home to do things,

**00:51:59** social things and whatever, not doing that now or so much.

**00:52:04** So I have that at home feeling like the working at home, living at home,

**00:52:10** completely at home feeling even more than I did when I decided I wanted an

**00:52:15** out of home studio.

**00:52:17** Yes.

**00:52:17** Right.

**00:52:18** So I am a very appreciative of having this place now.

**00:52:21** And I think is going to, it will continue to be of great use to us as time goes on,

**00:52:26** but we've just got to get the last little bits done and we'll be good.

**00:52:30** So I'm, but like super happy that we're here and we find, I've finally been

**00:52:36** able to record a podcast from this place.

**00:52:38** Congratulations on getting that done.

**00:52:40** I am extremely envious of your non-home place to work.

**00:52:44** That's really great that you have that.

**00:52:46** Well, whenever you want to break the seal and you're quarantined,

**00:52:49** I'll set up a desk for you.

**00:52:52** Nice try.

**00:52:53** I mean it.

**00:52:54** You ever want it?

**00:52:55** You can have it, you know?

**00:52:57** Yeah.

**00:52:57** No, we're not going to, we're not going to break the seal just yet.

**00:53:00** That's why I said whenever.

**00:53:03** It made me smile because just as this whole thing began, I was really trying

**00:53:07** to, trying to find another office outside of my house to work in.

**00:53:11** And obviously that, that got cut short.

**00:53:13** But one of the places that I was, I was looking at, they're like, Oh, we don't,

**00:53:18** we don't have any space available for you for what you need.

**00:53:21** I just got this email from them yesterday and they were like, Hey, you

**00:53:25** messaged us months ago about trying to find a space here.

**00:53:28** Well, we have anything you need.

**00:53:31** Right.

**00:53:32** And what was really great is like, I was talking to them about one space where I

**00:53:36** was like, Oh, this could work, but they wanted me to sign like a two year contract.

**00:53:41** And I was like, forget that.

**00:53:43** Like, are you crazy?

**00:53:44** No way.

**00:53:45** And this email that came from them was like, short term, long term, big, small,

**00:53:50** anything you need, we got a buddy.

**00:53:53** Like we could, we could do what you want.

**00:53:55** Knock down the wall between two spaces.

**00:53:57** We'll do it.

**00:53:58** You want to just read it for a week?

**00:53:59** No problem.

**00:54:00** Yeah.

**00:54:02** It was just such a funny email to get and, and as like, Oh, they have, they have

**00:54:07** got to be heard it cause I also imagine like my email must have been at the, like

**00:54:12** someone's going through their inbox for the past year, trying to find everyone

**00:54:17** who's ever contacted them about looking for a place and just messaging them.

**00:54:22** You know, and even for me, I was like, well, you know, because of our situation,

**00:54:26** like I can't, I can't break quarantine yet.

**00:54:28** I'd love to help you guys out and help me out at the same time, but I cannot help you.

**00:54:33** So, uh, you know, good luck filling those seats guys.

**00:56:20** Make your next move.

**00:56:21** Make your next website.

**00:56:22** So you published a little video.

**00:56:24** Will we call it a little video?

**00:56:26** It was, let me say why I'm calling it actually.

**00:56:29** Okay.

**00:56:30** It was shorter than the videos you've been doing recently.

**00:56:33** It was pretty timely because it was related to some news that was going on.

**00:56:37** And visually it was more typical gray style.

**00:56:41** So what is that?

**00:56:42** What is typical gray style?

**00:56:43** I mean, I don't know what that means.

**00:56:45** The old style.

**00:56:46** Ah, okay.

**00:56:47** Right.

**00:56:47** Well, like I think it's very fair to say that like your videos of late have been

**00:56:51** much more ambitious visually.

**00:56:54** This was more like the standard stick figure style.

**00:56:57** You know, there was no spinning spaceships or, uh, little animations that I don't

**00:57:03** know, am I saying this right?

**00:57:04** I don't know what I'm saying.

**00:57:05** I don't know what I hate when you ask me that question.

**00:57:07** Cause I know what I mean.

**00:57:08** I think everyone knows what I'm saying if they've seen it, but then I feel like I'm

**00:57:12** being critical of the work of your anime, which is not what I'm intending to do.

**00:57:16** You're not being critical at all.

**00:57:17** The reason I ask is because I just, I always think it's very interesting with

**00:57:21** any kind of media consumption is when you watch something, you have a response

**00:57:28** to it and it's often hard to articulate why you have that response.

**00:57:33** Right.

**00:57:34** And so I was asking not because I'm like, is Mike criticizing this different style?

**00:57:40** It's just more like, I wanted to see what are you picking up on?

**00:57:44** All right.

**00:57:45** I'm watching it now again.

**00:57:46** And I know what I, I know what it is now.

**00:57:48** Okay.

**00:57:48** What are you picking up on?

**00:57:49** Nothing's moving.

**00:57:51** Yes.

**00:57:51** Okay.

**00:57:51** That like, that is the key difference right there that you, that you like, this is one

**00:57:57** of those, you don't notice, but your brain does moments where it's like, it's hard to

**00:58:01** articulate unless you go back and you're really trying to pay attention.

**00:58:05** But that is the key difference.

**00:58:06** Nothing is moving.

**00:58:07** Everything is static slides.

**00:58:09** Or like the movement that I just saw was like, that could have been done in PowerPoint.

**00:58:14** Yes.

**00:58:14** Yeah.

**00:58:15** Yeah.

**00:58:15** That is a key difference.

**00:58:17** There's, there's no, um, I always forget what it's called.

**00:58:21** But there's a, there's a visual effect I really like that we did in the Pirates video

**00:58:25** where if you are panning the camera horizontally, like across a scene, you can

**00:58:33** have the, the distant background moves less than the foreground.

**00:58:38** No one ever really notices it, but it gives it a sense of depth of like, Oh, those,

**00:58:41** those trees are further away than the ship.

**00:58:46** And the stick figure is closer to the camera than the ship is.

**00:58:50** Right.

**00:58:51** But that kind of stuff's a real pain in the ass to do as you might imagine, you

**00:58:55** know, but, but yeah, so, you know, you're like, it's just interesting to me that

**00:58:59** like you, you pick up straight away.

**00:59:01** Like, wait, is this a little video or something about it feels different?

**00:59:05** And it's little stuff like that, that I think you're noticing that like, yeah,

**00:59:08** there's no motion in the video or there's very minimal motion in the video.

**00:59:13** And my voice is also a little bit different in the video because I didn't

**00:59:17** do a hundred takes and the writing style is slightly different.

**00:59:22** So there's a lot of things about that video that to me register as

**00:59:26** clearly very different.

**00:59:28** The, just like, you know, it's a, it's a paper texture video, right?

**00:59:32** It's just like the background is all the, the CGB grade paper texture,

**00:59:36** whatever you would call it, which again, there are just recently not many

**00:59:40** videos that you've put out, which have that visual style to them, which was

**00:59:44** the style when it was just you.

**00:59:47** And so like it is quite different in those ways, which is why I would say

**00:59:52** it's a little video and I can, and I understand exactly why because you are

**00:59:58** making a video about something that happened just a few weeks ago.

**01:00:02** And anyone that's listened to this show for long enough knows that it is

**01:00:05** incredibly rare for you to put something out like that with maybe the

**01:00:10** exception of the lockdown productivity video, but at the same time, you

**01:00:15** nearly killed yourself making that video.

**01:00:17** And I'm pretty confident that like, that wasn't what happened here.

**01:00:22** Like I'm sure you were very busy for a few days, but like, it's a

**01:00:25** quite a different thing.

**01:00:27** Yeah.

**01:00:27** Yeah.

**01:00:27** I mean, this, this, um, to put it in context here.

**01:00:30** So the little video that I put out is titled the Supreme Court Rules

**01:00:34** on Faithless Electors.

**01:00:36** And yes, this is another electoral college kind of video.

**01:00:40** And basically the way this happened is you know this Mike, cause you use

**01:00:45** like the YouTube studio, that's the behind the scenes app, but when you're

**01:00:48** managing your YouTube channel as like someone who owns a YouTube channel,

**01:00:52** you see comments coming in from all of the videos in one place.

**01:00:59** And this is actually quite useful as a creator because sometimes it allows

**01:01:02** you to catch, Oh, something's going on with this video in a way that

**01:01:06** you wouldn't notice otherwise.

**01:01:07** Oh, right.

**01:01:08** Like the algorithm has picked it up.

**01:01:09** So there's new activity on this video.

**01:01:11** Yeah.

**01:01:12** So like, Oh, there's a bunch of comments on an old video that I can see are coming

**01:01:15** in, why is that?

**01:01:16** And so I was just doing something in the YouTube backend and I saw that there

**01:01:20** were a bunch of new comments on the national popular vote interstate compact

**01:01:24** video that I'd made and all the comments were like, Oh, well, this plan is dead.

**01:01:28** This plan is killed now.

**01:01:30** It's, this is never going to happen.

**01:01:32** You know, boo-hoo sad faces.

**01:01:34** And so of course that immediately caught my attention.

**01:01:36** I was like, what's going on with this?

**01:01:38** And I looked it up and there, you find out your news from YouTube

**01:01:42** comments on your old videos.

**01:01:44** I mean, look, we can hear, here's the thing.

**01:01:47** Here's the thing.

**01:01:48** We can actually get to talking about the news in a second.

**01:01:52** But this is one of the many mechanisms by which when I constantly

**01:01:56** proselytize to people, Hey guys, you don't need to actively follow the news.

**01:02:02** Like news will find you whether you're trying to actively pursue it or not.

**01:02:07** Like you just don't think of all of the little sieves in your life.

**01:02:11** And this is totally one of those mechanisms of like, Oh, something

**01:02:15** must have happened in the world related to the electoral college.

**01:02:20** And now I need to figure it out.

**01:02:21** Cause I can see there's a bunch of comments on this nine month old

**01:02:24** video now, all of a sudden.

**01:02:26** So I looked it up and there was a recent Supreme court ruling having to do

**01:02:29** with the faithless electors.

**01:02:30** And so here's what happened.

**01:02:34** This was, this was an evening time and I was just Googling around and

**01:02:39** trying to figure out what it was.

**01:02:41** And I did come across a bunch of news stories that were reporting on this.

**01:02:45** And like the headlines were Supreme court bans faithless electors.

**01:02:51** You know, faithless electors, illegal says Supreme court, you

**01:02:55** know, this kind of stuff.

**01:02:57** And I was like, Oh, that's really quite surprising.

**01:02:59** That's, that's quite shocking that the Supreme court would step in on this

**01:03:03** issue in such a forceful way.

**01:03:06** And of course, when once you start digging through the details, it's not remotely

**01:03:10** that it's like, it's more subtle than the headlines are portraying.

**01:03:14** So I spent an evening trying to like, dig around and figure out what this was.

**01:03:18** And then I eventually got to the actual Supreme court.

**01:03:21** They put out like a PDF of here's the summary of our judgment that you can

**01:03:25** read through and it's surprisingly readable.

**01:03:27** So I was looking through that and it was, it was interesting.

**01:03:30** And I kind of thought, Oh, well, this was just an, an evening's idle

**01:03:34** curiosity explored of like, Oh, okay.

**01:03:38** Well now, now I know what the deal was, why this video was, was being more active.

**01:03:43** But as happens sometimes the next morning, I just woke up mad.

**01:03:48** Like I was still thinking about it.

**01:03:49** And the reason I was mad is I was, is I was mad at all the stupid headlines

**01:03:53** that I'd come across from the day before of like, is it that hard to write a

**01:03:58** headline that isn't explicitly wrong about what has actually occurred?

**01:04:04** Right?

**01:04:04** Like there's no ban.

**01:04:05** Nothing has been made illegal.

**01:04:07** There was just like a reaffirmation of 150 year old verdict in the Supreme court.

**01:04:13** Like the case was a total nothing.

**01:04:15** It was just like, yeah, we're reaffirming a state's rights issue in the US.

**01:04:19** Nothing had changed.

**01:04:21** The Supreme court just reminded everybody of something that

**01:04:23** already existed, right?

**01:04:25** Yeah.

**01:04:26** Yeah.

**01:04:26** And it's, I was even thinking like, I don't know why the Supreme court

**01:04:29** even took this case.

**01:04:31** Like, why did they, what was the deal here?

**01:04:33** Like, I don't understand the way it works is like the Supreme court obviously

**01:04:37** gets thousands and thousands and thousands of cases submitted to them every year.

**01:04:42** Part of the whole process is that the court picks which cases they're going to

**01:04:46** rule on and I mean, it's not unreasonable to assume that they pick cases because

**01:04:53** there's something in particular that they think was either wrong or is like

**01:04:59** really important to make sure that like, there's a verdict on this one way or another.

**01:05:04** So like Supreme court news watchers, you can make pretty good guesses that if,

**01:05:10** if say like a case where someone who has been convicted and is in prison, if their

**01:05:17** case has made it all the way to the Supreme court and the Supreme court has

**01:05:21** accepted that case, smart money is on the verdict is going to be overturned.

**01:05:26** Right?

**01:05:27** Like that's part of why they accepted the case.

**01:05:29** Right.

**01:05:29** So I don't even know why they accepted this case in the first place.

**01:05:32** Cause it was just such a boring nothing, but I woke up like angry at the news

**01:05:36** headlines I had read the previous day and it's like, why did they have to write

**01:05:41** it as though a thing was different?

**01:05:44** And so as happens sometimes when you wake up angry as like straight to the keyboard,

**01:05:49** type, type, type, type, type, type, type, type, like I'm just really annoyed about

**01:05:55** this and basically realized I had very quickly written most of what was a pretty

**01:06:03** decent quick little update script and then decided, you know what, I'm going to

**01:06:07** drop the other thing that I'm working on right now and let me just see if I can

**01:06:10** rush a quick and very intentionally light little video around this topic.

**01:06:18** And this is just one of these cases of the stars aligning.

**01:06:21** Like it's a topic I'm already incredibly well versed in.

**01:06:25** So I don't need to like re-research a bunch of stuff.

**01:06:29** Uh, the video script itself can, you know, the majority of it is just a recap of the

**01:06:34** situation so that you can understand what the verdict is with a little bit of me,

**01:06:39** like sticking the knife into the news about like these headlines are lying to

**01:06:43** you and then telling you like nothing has occurred here.

**01:06:47** But yeah, so it just sort of happened very quickly.

**01:06:50** And I think that's been on my mind for a while and goes all the way back to

**01:06:56** September and changing the business model is I was very aware that like when the

**01:07:02** channel was younger, I did feel a lot freer to occasionally make just shorter

**01:07:12** videos on whatever, like on a really small thing.

**01:07:15** Oh, right.

**01:07:16** Yeah.

**01:07:16** Cause it just as a refresher, it's the idea that like, if the Patreon was triggered

**01:07:21** on a per video basis, you felt like maybe you needed to have a real big point to

**01:07:27** each video.

**01:07:28** Yeah.

**01:07:28** So, so yeah, this is, this is exactly like one of the things that was on my

**01:07:33** mind is triggering it per video now constantly brought up the question of

**01:07:40** like, does this video count?

**01:07:42** Right.

**01:07:42** Or does this video not count?

**01:07:44** Oh yeah.

**01:07:44** Because you could choose, couldn't you?

**01:07:46** Yeah.

**01:07:47** Yeah.

**01:07:47** I was choosing like, if I published a video, was this going to count or was it

**01:07:52** going to not count?

**01:07:54** That's a lot to point yourself.

**01:07:56** Yeah.

**01:07:56** And it, and it was a thing that over the course of a couple of years, I

**01:08:00** recognize was genuinely becoming a real problem in the way that I was thinking

**01:08:04** about topics and like working on stuff.

**01:08:06** And so when I was making that decision to switch last September or October,

**01:08:12** whenever it was one of the things that I had in mind was what I was thinking

**01:08:17** of as light gray, right?

**01:08:20** Like, Hey, you know, it would be nice if I can make some light gray videos.

**01:08:24** Not everything needs to be like big and serious.

**01:08:28** I can intentionally try to just keep it on my mind of like, Hey man, you've got

**01:08:34** the option to just try and do something that's simpler and shorter sometimes.

**01:08:41** Now, of course, like there's always costs with doing any kinds of projects.

**01:08:45** So, you know, one of the things I've talked about a lot this year is the

**01:08:48** change to my workflow of like, Oh, I have things that are topic locked and I'm,

**01:08:51** I'm trying to really stick to that.

**01:08:53** And it's very helpful.

**01:08:55** And something like this breaks that rule a little bit of, Hey, we're going to drop

**01:09:00** everything for this week and just do this one quick thing, you know, like I don't

**01:09:06** want to do that very often.

**01:09:07** Cause I think that does have other consequences.

**01:09:10** But it's useful to keep in mind of like when the stars align that can make sense

**01:09:15** to do, and since changing the way my business works, this has been on my mind

**01:09:21** of like, just keep your eye on the horizon for if this case comes up, this is now

**01:09:26** an option that's available and you can just do, and it's not something you have

**01:09:31** to agonize about does this video count?

**01:09:35** And if it doesn't count, does it make sense to work on, you know?

**01:09:39** So I have to say, I'm really pleased with the way this has gone of, of just like,

**01:09:44** okay, I can make a little thing.

**01:09:46** I can put it up.

**01:09:47** It's totally fine.

**01:09:49** And it's another way in which I'm grateful that like through the support of my

**01:09:56** audience, I have options to make different sorts of stuff.

**01:10:01** And I'm always very careful to not say like, Hey, I'm going to be able to make

**01:10:06** more because that's not just the way my channel works, but I have the ability to

**01:10:14** like put out a smaller thing like this sometimes.

**01:10:17** And I think everybody is happier to like have the video than to not have the video.

**01:10:23** And it's nice to, as the creator, be able to think, Oh, there's just something

**01:10:29** smaller here that I can do.

**01:10:31** Right.

**01:10:31** It is very interesting looking at a bunch of my older stuff to realize how

**01:10:36** short some of the videos are the amount of stuff that I have, which is under two

**01:10:41** minutes from the older, older back catalog is surprisingly high.

**01:10:46** But yeah, so this I viewed as in some ways, the start again of this kind of video,

**01:10:54** smaller, simpler, and that can be okay.

**01:10:57** So I've, I've made like to try to help myself think about it.

**01:11:01** I've actually put it as like another playlist genre thing in my YouTube channel of like,

**01:11:06** Oh, Hey, there's the main videos and here are the light gray videos, you know, so maybe

**01:11:13** your expectations in watching these can be a little lower and that's fine.

**01:11:17** And you know, because there's, there's other things to watch here as well.

**01:11:21** And they don't have the same amount of pressure as like the main videos do.

**01:11:28** And that's also one of the things you might be picking up on is even in the video

**01:11:32** thumbnail, like it doesn't have the official little line and CGP gray logo on the side.

**01:11:38** It's just like, Oh, this is a regular thumbnail to try to visually indicate like

**01:11:43** this video is different from the others.

**01:11:46** It's a little bit of like an off sequence kind of video.

**01:11:49** I'm looking at that.

**01:11:50** Okay.

**01:11:51** So the logo on the left side, that's the key, right?

**01:11:54** Yeah.

**01:11:54** So the logo on the left side, I feel like I put those on serious videos in some, in

**01:12:00** some sense, because I can see like the video about your YouTube suspension, right.

**01:12:06** The, and then all the footnote videos and stuff like that.

**01:12:10** They don't have it.

**01:12:11** That's cool.

**01:12:11** That's a nice little branding trick.

**01:12:13** Yeah.

**01:12:13** Again, I don't think anybody consciously notices it, but it's something I just try

**01:12:18** to do to enforce like, here is this distinction.

**01:12:22** And so I just, just going through the back catalog and trying to collect up all of the,

**01:12:27** here's the random other videos and put them in one place and like, okay, great.

**01:12:31** Now this is a genre.

**01:12:32** We have official heavy serious, like gray explains many, many, many drafts, hundreds

**01:12:39** of hours of animation kind of videos.

**01:12:41** And then down at the bottom, it's like, Oh, here's the, here's the other stuff.

**01:12:44** Here's the light gray stuff.

**01:12:46** You know, enjoy.

**01:12:47** I hope you like it.

**01:12:48** Do you see this as a shift to your theme?

**01:12:52** Do you think that?

**01:12:53** No, no, I like the, what I think of this is.

**01:13:00** I mean, Mike, you know this as well, right?

**01:13:02** When, when you have a direct dependency on the audience for what you're making, it

**01:13:10** intrinsically changes the way that you think about things.

**01:13:14** And so I just really think that for my YouTube channel in particular, ultimately

**01:13:22** going to the per video thing, it made sense for a little while, but it grew

**01:13:28** into more of a problem than it was worth.

**01:13:31** And so switching to monthly got rid of that problem and now allowed me to, to go

**01:13:41** back to a thing that I used to do more frequently, but just died out as the

**01:13:47** problem of like, does this video count grew more and more in my mind?

**01:13:53** So I don't think it's, it's a new direction.

**01:13:57** It's a little bit of a return to optionality.

**01:14:00** I think is the, is the way that I would, I would put it.

**01:14:03** Okay.

**01:14:04** But yeah, it's also totally mind blowing from my perspective to have a video be

**01:14:08** conceived of and then uploaded in such a short period of time.

**01:14:13** It's like, wow, that's amazing.

**01:14:17** Talking about yearly themes.

**01:14:19** So I want to talk about yearly themes a little bit today, because I think I may

**01:14:23** have mentioned this on a previous episode.

**01:14:25** Yeah.

**01:14:25** You, you sneak peek this last time that there's going to be an update to your

**01:14:28** yearly theme.

**01:14:29** The update is I have a new one.

**01:14:31** Right.

**01:14:32** Your, your refinements.

**01:14:33** No, no more.

**01:14:34** Well, I'll get to that.

**01:14:35** So just as a quick aside, I thought that this is an

**01:14:38** a full on yearly themes episode, but in the sense, like, we're not going to go

**01:14:42** into the full backstory.

**01:14:44** I don't think you are going to have a new yearly theme today.

**01:14:47** No.

**01:14:48** If you are new to the show, you don't know what a yearly theme is.

**01:14:51** We set these typically at the beginning of every year and they are like our guides

**01:14:56** for the year might be a word or a phrase.

**01:14:58** And it kind of has a lot of meaning behind it.

**01:15:01** And there's a lot of offshoots from it and what that means.

**01:15:03** And then it will help us kind of shape that we want to achieve in a year.

**01:15:06** If you want more background than this, you can go and listen to episode 95 of the show,

**01:15:11** which was our 2020 yearly themes episode where we talk a lot about and set our themes.

**01:15:16** And then there's also a wonderful YouTube video that Gray made about themes and like

**01:15:20** whether they're yearly or quarterly or seasonal, but like the idea as to what a theme is.

**01:15:25** So you can go and get a lot of information from those if you want a bit more of a background

**01:15:29** to it.

**01:15:30** So what I want to do is I want to recap my theme because I'm not going to recap this theme anymore.

**01:15:38** The year of refinement is done.

**01:15:40** Okay.

**01:15:41** So this is the post-mortem on year of refinement.

**01:15:43** Yeah.

**01:15:44** Yeah.

**01:15:46** I hope that it will come back at some point in the future, but I think it will become very

**01:15:50** clear why the theme is over for me because frankly, I just feel like in a nutshell, I

**01:15:56** can't achieve what I wanted to achieve from when I set out this year for what I wanted

**01:16:02** this theme to be.

**01:16:03** No.

**01:16:03** And I thought about trying to adapt it and just like take that meaning and put it to

**01:16:08** other things.

**01:16:09** And I was thinking about that for a while, but ultimately I ended up landing on something

**01:16:14** which is quite different and made much more sense than me just trying to find ways to

**01:16:20** make refinement fit to the other things.

**01:16:22** Because frankly, I'm not in refinement at the moment.

**01:16:25** It's just not where I am and it's not what my focus is because I've abandoned so much

**01:16:30** of my life in the last few months.

**01:16:32** It's not refinement.

**01:16:33** Yeah.

**01:16:33** And even just the thing of trying to refit the theme, I feel like no, no, no.

**01:16:40** If you're trying to make it fit something new, like it's already a bad sign.

**01:16:44** Like it should feel like a natural fit.

**01:16:46** You shouldn't be trying to make it rework it.

**01:16:49** More of what I meant was, and this has happened for me in past years, I will have something

**01:16:53** come up that I think about or it's come my way.

**01:16:56** And I think to myself, would this fit in my yearly theme?

**01:17:00** And then I kind of look at my yearly theme and be like, okay, it fits if I think about it in

**01:17:05** these ways.

**01:17:06** And then great, I'll move forward with it because like now I feel like this does make sense for

**01:17:10** my yearly theme.

**01:17:12** So like I did that as like, I was like, okay, so stuff like membership, right?

**01:17:16** And more tax.

**01:17:17** Does that fit in the year of refinement?

**01:17:18** Let me think.

**01:17:19** Well, I could say and then very quickly, it was like, you know what, that doesn't.

**01:17:23** And if I'm going to really focus on this in the way that I want to, I need to put the year of

**01:17:28** refinement away.

**01:17:30** So because we won't review the year of refinement next year, when we do our 2021 yearly themes, I

**01:17:37** wanted to do that now because it will also, I think, give a little understanding as to why I

**01:17:42** think I have to put this theme to bed.

**01:17:44** So I had a few different areas that I wanted to focus on.

**01:17:48** So first was to do what I can to consider is to better myself in the ways that I was

**01:17:54** interested in.

**01:17:55** So understanding more on food, understanding more on culture.

**01:17:59** Well, the opportunity is that I wanted to give myself I can't do.

**01:18:04** So like, you know, like obviously I'm not eating at restaurants at all, which was part of it, but

**01:18:10** also was to take courses and stuff.

**01:18:12** Like I mentioned that wine was a thing that I was interested in.

**01:18:14** Well, I had a couple of courses booked, but like I'm not doing them.

**01:18:20** One of them has been moved to way later in the year, like and really the year of refinement, like a

**01:18:25** lot of it was focused around this very first point.

**01:18:28** So the fact that I can't really do any of that the way that I want to makes me feel like I liked

**01:18:34** this theme a lot and everything that it stood for for me, because it was a lot more focused on

**01:18:40** taking time this year for me, just for me.

**01:18:44** And being that as like a part thing that I wanted to work on was myself.

**01:18:49** I want to do this, but I'll do it when the world is in a different place.

**01:18:54** The other thing was hobbies.

**01:18:55** And the main hobby that I'd said that I was excited about and interested in was like pottery.

**01:19:00** And that requires going to places or getting a pottery wheel for your house.

**01:19:06** You can't put a pottery wheel in your home.

**01:19:08** It has to be like, well, you can, but then you'll ruin whatever room you put it in.

**01:19:14** People tend to put them in basements or in sheds.

**01:19:17** I haven't got any of those.

**01:19:19** I do have, it ended up by me, a wonderful little gift of like a like a hand clay thing.

**01:19:24** So I'm going to try that out.

**01:19:26** But what I really want to do with the pottery stuff is wheel based, right?

**01:19:31** Like to actually do things on a pottery wheel.

**01:19:34** And again, I know I enjoyed that and I know I want to do more of it.

**01:19:38** So when I can, I will go back to it, but that's not going to happen anytime soon.

**01:19:42** I have gotten kind of two things in my life now, which I do consider more of new interests.

**01:19:50** One is like over the last few weeks, we've been watching a lot of movies.

**01:19:53** We are typically TV show people for home viewing because we like to binge shows.

**01:19:58** But we decided, well, what if we just like quote unquote binge movies, pick a director, pick an actor, watch a bunch of this stuff.

**01:20:07** So we've been doing that, which is because I love movies, but just never really watch movies at home very often.

**01:20:14** And this has been like a good reason to to watch movies.

**01:20:17** It's because at home I like kind of dependable viewing.

**01:20:22** Right. So like you pick a thing and you start watching that thing like binging a TV show.

**01:20:26** And you know, like this is what that TV show is going to be for a while.

**01:20:29** And that's your show.

**01:20:30** And movies are like, well, it could be anything.

**01:20:33** And also like movie to movie.

**01:20:35** Do you have any idea what the quality is going to be like?

**01:20:37** You're going to like them, right?

**01:20:39** I mean, what I found is in picking certain directors or actors, if you like their work, there's typically a through line.

**01:20:47** Yeah, that's that's an interesting thing to do for this concept of binging movies, of picking a director, picking an actor, because like with many things in life,

**01:20:56** there's options that you think of as like the high variance option and the low variance option.

**01:21:01** And TV shows are the low variance option.

**01:21:04** Like, oh, yeah, you kind of know what you're going to get.

**01:21:07** There's just the question of a season changeover, you know, and especially like a writing team changeover.

**01:21:12** But like generally you're getting what you know.

**01:21:14** And then movies are the high variance outcome, which is why it can be hard to pick them.

**01:21:20** Like I think of our viewing habits and it is always the same thing, like aspirationally, you want to watch a movie and then you sort of fall back on the TV show.

**01:21:31** Like, I don't even know what kind of movie I want to watch, let alone like if any of these ones will be the right ones.

**01:21:37** Yeah. Yeah. And so it's like, oh, there's an hour of not picking a movie and then that is exactly on the office.

**01:21:44** It's like, you know, say I want to watch a movie.

**01:21:46** I'm like, what? And then like, I never know what to pick.

**01:21:49** Like I get real like paralysis of choice with home movie viewing.

**01:21:53** I can never know what to go for.

**01:21:55** And so I typically would just watch comedies because they feel like the safest option for me.

**01:22:02** So we've been like we started with like, we watched a bunch of Tarantino movies because I think it was just like I wanted to watch Reservoir Dogs.

**01:22:12** I'd never seen it. And I was like, well, let's just watch a bunch of these.

**01:22:15** Then I just was like, well, why don't we watch?

**01:22:18** We've watched like a bunch of Tarantino movies, which are kind of violent or like gangster-y.

**01:22:22** So it's like, you know what I want to watch?

**01:22:24** Why don't we watch The Departed, which is a movie that I really like.

**01:22:27** And I wanted to show it to Adina. And I was like, you know what?

**01:22:30** I love Leonardo DiCaprio. Let's watch a bunch of Leonardo DiCaprio movies.

**01:22:34** So that's kind of like where we're going at the moment.

**01:22:37** And then it's like my favorite director is Martin Scorsese.

**01:22:40** And he has directed a bunch of Leonardo DiCaprio movies.

**01:22:44** So once we're done with Leonardo DiCaprio movies, I think I don't want to move on to just watching a bunch of Scorsese movies.

**01:22:49** So I think this might be where we go for a while, just like following these chains.

**01:22:53** But it's like, well, we don't have to.

**01:22:56** All we have to do is which Leonardo DiCaprio movie are going to be watched today.

**01:23:01** And that's way easier than like which movie.

**01:23:04** Yeah, that's a million times easier.

**01:23:07** I'm always struck by the absurdity of the situation, which is like, OK, turn on Apple TV.

**01:23:13** Now I have all media produced by humans available for me to watch.

**01:23:19** And it's like and I kind of don't want to watch any of these things.

**01:23:25** It is an absurd position to be in.

**01:23:29** It's it's yeah, I don't know.

**01:23:32** So I have to say I'm giving two thumbs up to this algorithm of yours.

**01:23:37** I think this is a great idea to try to constrain it in some way by director or actor.

**01:23:42** I think that's a fantastic idea.

**01:23:44** And I like it because it gives you the ability to have a little bit of continuity

**01:23:51** in the comparison game of, oh, what is this actor like compared to these previous two movies?

**01:23:58** And like it gives you a different level to think about and enjoy what you're watching.

**01:24:03** So I really like this. This is a great idea.

**01:24:05** And I like it because I really do love movies and but I just find myself never watching them at home.

**01:24:12** So it's nice to be able to get into that a little bit more, you know, because typically, like, you know,

**01:24:17** can we will end and we'll talk about it a bit.

**01:24:19** And we don't do that after we watch like three TV shows.

**01:24:21** There's nothing to talk about typically, right?

**01:24:24** Like with more shows.

**01:24:25** But like a good movie will leave you thinking about something or wanting to talk about like,

**01:24:31** oh, I liked these choices that they made or I'm not sure what I thought about this.

**01:24:35** Or we also watch a bunch of Christian Bale.

**01:24:38** No, we start if we didn't start with Scorsese.

**01:24:40** We started with Christopher Nolan to know we started with Tarantino.

**01:24:44** Then we did Christopher.

**01:24:45** This is not important.

**01:24:49** And then the other thing that I've got people need to know, they must know.

**01:24:53** The other thing that I've really gotten into recently is Formula One.

**01:24:56** OK, so this is this is going to be your sport to follow.

**01:24:58** Yes, actually. We watched the Netflix documentary Drive to Survive.

**01:25:03** It's just you bend us.

**01:25:05** And both me and Edina really enjoyed it.

**01:25:08** So then we were like, well, let's give Formula One a go and we love it.

**01:25:11** And so we're just going to keep doing it.

**01:25:13** And it's a nice thing because it's something that we both got into at the same time.

**01:25:16** We've not really too much knowledge beforehand.

**01:25:19** So it's like something that it's not one or the other like saying like, oh, you should.

**01:25:24** I like this thing.

**01:25:24** I think you might like it, too.

**01:25:26** There's none of that involved.

**01:25:27** So yeah, it's really cool.

**01:25:28** And it's like in the sense for me of like there's a lot that happens around it,

**01:25:32** which I can choose to follow or not.

**01:25:34** And that makes it feel more like an interest than just watching something.

**01:25:38** You know, you can read the news about it.

**01:25:40** You can listen to podcasts about it.

**01:25:42** And there's YouTube.

**01:25:43** It's like it's a sport. Right.

**01:25:45** Like I feel like I'm trying to explain sport to people now.

**01:25:48** But I've never been a sport person.

**01:25:51** But this one's just in the kind of the intersection for me

**01:25:55** where for whatever reason, I'm enjoying it.

**01:25:57** So I feel like I've this is the part that I've actually had the most success in,

**01:26:02** which is introducing things which are refreshed or new for me

**01:26:07** that I would consider hobbies or interests.

**01:26:10** The next part that I wanted to do in the year of refinement

**01:26:13** is to refine my work focus, like making some small adjustments is what I said.

**01:26:17** Yeah, just just some tweaks, just some tweaks to the work.

**01:26:20** There are there just like little bit.

**01:26:21** Yeah, everything's going great.

**01:26:22** Just like, oh, just a little tightening, little adjustments.

**01:26:25** That's yeah, that's what this year is going to be for your business.

**01:26:28** There has been no small adjustments.

**01:26:30** Every adjustment is massive.

**01:26:31** So a small adjustment just can't cut right now.

**01:26:34** Right. Yeah.

**01:26:35** What I'm doing of where I am.

**01:26:36** And then the last part was to kind of refine what I'm known for.

**01:26:41** And that was kind of in through working on new projects

**01:26:43** and looking at different areas of that stuff that I cover.

**01:26:47** And to show that I do have Austin Evans, the test drivers is part of that

**01:26:51** and was part of the idea, because it's talking about different types

**01:26:55** of computing platforms, different types of devices from different types

**01:26:58** of manufacturers to what I usually cover.

**01:27:01** But it's stuff that I care about, but don't usually get to talk about.

**01:27:05** There's still more I want to do in that area.

**01:27:08** And I think this will be something that I'll come back to more in the future.

**01:27:10** I like where I've gotten to with this.

**01:27:13** But basically, I cannot right now just focus on me.

**01:27:19** Right. It's not about what I am known for.

**01:27:22** That's not that can't be my focus right now.

**01:27:25** It was going to be, but it can't be now.

**01:27:27** I have to look at things much more broadly at the moment.

**01:27:31** So ultimately, the year of refinement

**01:27:35** is just not the right theme for now.

**01:27:38** Too much has changed around me.

**01:27:40** I don't feel like I'm the same person that I was six months ago.

**01:27:44** Right. And nor do I feel like

**01:27:47** I can permit myself to just fuss on these internal things.

**01:27:53** Fuss is a terrible word there, but that's perfect.

**01:27:55** Yeah, you did have a sort of fussy theme for this year.

**01:28:00** And that was by design.

**01:28:02** Yeah. And that's totally fine.

**01:28:04** Like, but fuss is just it could not be more misaligned

**01:28:10** with the reality of the previous six months.

**01:28:12** Yeah. Like, oh, I'm going to try some wine.

**01:28:17** I'm going to go to a pottery class.

**01:28:21** That was where I was in my life, because I'd worked really hard for years

**01:28:28** and things were nice and stable.

**01:28:30** Yeah. Now it's time to relax and focus on some of the enjoyable

**01:28:35** frivolities of life. Right.

**01:28:37** Nope. I mean, not only does it not feel right,

**01:28:42** it's also just not what I want to prioritize.

**01:28:45** So I have a brand new yearly theme. Oh, wow.

**01:28:49** This is the first on Cortex. Yeah.

**01:28:50** The mid-year switch. So I'm very excited.

**01:28:52** Yeah, because I have in the past, I added some stuff in.

**01:28:57** I have retired some stuff, but I've never gone like, all right,

**01:29:01** that one's done. Here's a new one.

**01:29:03** And my plan is that this would just run to the end of this year

**01:29:06** and then I'll pick a new theme for 2021, which will probably be more in line

**01:29:11** with this one than refinement, because I don't expect the world

**01:29:14** to have changed that much in the next six months.

**01:29:19** But who the hell knows anymore?

**01:29:21** Right. Anyway, so six months is a long time now.

**01:29:24** It's both a short and long amount of time.

**01:29:29** This episode of Cortex is brought to you by ExpressVPN.

**01:29:32** It's fair to say that we all want to browse the Internet

**01:29:34** without having the rest of the world know what we're doing, right?

**01:29:38** That's what we want. So we're using Cognito Windows sometimes.

**01:29:41** Maybe you've got something you want to keep just to yourself.

**01:29:43** You don't want the world knowing about it.

**01:29:45** Did you know that even in incognito mode, your online activity

**01:29:48** can still be traced, even if you clear your browser history?

**01:29:51** Doesn't matter where you get your Internet from,

**01:29:53** because your ISP can see every single website that you have visited.

**01:29:57** That's why even when at home, it's a great idea to use ExpressVPN.

**01:30:01** I use ExpressVPN and I think that you should too.

**01:30:05** ExpressVPN is an app that reroutes your Internet connection

**01:30:07** through their secure servers, so your ISP can't see the sites that you visit.

**01:30:12** It's available on all of your devices, your phone, your computer,

**01:30:15** even your smart TV. So just no excuse to not be using it,

**01:30:18** to not give it a try.

**01:30:19** I use ExpressVPN and I'm super happy with how fast it works.

**01:30:23** I'm super happy with how easy it is to connect it.

**01:30:25** I just tap a button. It lives in the menu bar on my Mac.

**01:30:28** I have the iOS app installed whenever I want to turn it on.

**01:30:31** Super quick, easy to do.

**01:30:54** Our thanks to ExpressVPN for their support of this show and Relay FM.

**01:30:58** My yearly theme for the rest of 2020 is called the year of shift.

**01:31:04** Hmm. This name was inspired by my co-founder, Stephen Hackett.

**01:31:09** He is of the gray mindset of giving project names to all projects.

**01:31:14** And when we started working on the membership stuff

**01:31:19** to change over to introduce the membership bonus content for shows like this one,

**01:31:23** he called it membership.

**01:31:25** Oh, that's good.

**01:31:26** I thought it was a very clever name.

**01:31:28** It was a funny name.

**01:31:28** And then the word shift just kept bouncing around in my brain.

**01:31:33** So I have a few points that I'm focusing on now all around shifting.

**01:31:38** First is shifting business model for me and my company.

**01:31:41** So this is in membership focus.

**01:31:44** Right. So creating this whole new platform for us to offer more membership content.

**01:31:49** That's one part.

**01:31:50** And then also continuing to move the sales away from me,

**01:31:55** which is something that I was doing more slowly before.

**01:31:58** But now I think is a thing that I want to continue with more gusto

**01:32:02** so I can continue working on content more, which is the other big part.

**01:32:08** So I'll just move straight into that, which is for shifting my focus.

**01:32:12** So I want my focus now to be more on caring about content

**01:32:17** creation than running the business.

**01:32:20** Because that's where I mean, I spoke about this in our last episode quite a lot,

**01:32:24** so I don't want to rehash a lot of it.

**01:32:25** But I want to make sure that the content that I'm making is so good now

**01:32:30** that people will happily pay for more of it.

**01:32:35** Like that's something that I want to keep doing.

**01:32:37** And so like that means working hard on making sure that the membership stuff is

**01:32:41** good, but also that the shows themselves are good.

**01:32:45** So people enjoy, they want to keep listening and they're like, you know what?

**01:32:49** I would like more of that.

**01:32:50** So that is like a focus that I want to continue doing.

**01:32:53** It's a model that I want to follow.

**01:32:55** You know, I want my model now to be making the stuff as good as possible

**01:33:01** for the people that are listening rather than how do I keep growing

**01:33:05** the shows to increase our rates?

**01:33:07** Right, right.

**01:33:08** So it's the focus being more on what's here than what it could be.

**01:33:14** Lots of content creators will do their best to make their content as good as it

**01:33:20** can be in the hopes that it will grow their audience.

**01:33:26** And we want to grow our audiences for a few reasons.

**01:33:28** One of them is because if your content is advertising focused,

**01:33:32** your ads are worth more money if your audience is larger.

**01:33:35** Right. Right.

**01:33:36** And that drives a type of thinking.

**01:33:40** And it's not saying that that makes shows less or more enjoyable,

**01:33:44** but it's just a way of thinking.

**01:33:46** I want to make stuff that so good that people will share it

**01:33:50** or I want to make stuff that's going to be a big splash.

**01:33:53** Right. But now I think I'm more in the focus of like, how do I create content

**01:33:59** which is in and of itself interesting for the people that already care?

**01:34:05** And I, as of right now, do not really know what that means

**01:34:11** or how different those things are.

**01:34:14** But it's more acknowledging the change in my thinking

**01:34:18** that I want to make this stuff as good as it can possibly be

**01:34:23** for the love of making the thing, which when you are trying to start

**01:34:28** and grow a business, you can lose sight of a little bit because you are in growth.

**01:34:33** Like that's where you are.

**01:34:34** Your mind is in like I need to get this thing to a point

**01:34:38** where it can be sustainable.

**01:34:42** And I've done that, but it just never really changed my thinking.

**01:34:47** Just like this was the way we did it.

**01:34:48** This is what I do. This is how it's done.

**01:34:50** And what I want to do now

**01:34:54** and what I am doing now is taking a step back

**01:34:58** and thinking like, am I making the best stuff I can possibly make?

**01:35:05** And that's what I'm kind of shifting my attention towards.

**01:35:09** So this this is it's quite hard to nail this part down.

**01:35:14** This is a very new way of thinking.

**01:35:17** Yeah, but like I just think you're going through a little bit

**01:35:20** of the early stages of finding your brain

**01:35:24** and considering what does it mean to have a membership program?

**01:35:29** Yes, that's exactly it. Yeah.

**01:35:31** Yeah, this this is like I'm here with you, man.

**01:35:35** It's like, you know, this shift is

**01:35:39** it's different in the way that you think about things in a lot of intangible

**01:35:44** and difficult to explain ways.

**01:35:46** But I think you did really you have articulated well, one of them, which is

**01:35:50** that if you if you're running a business, you have all of these different models.

**01:35:55** And of course, with all business models, like growth in general is a good thing.

**01:36:03** But some models are more tied to the necessity of growth than others.

**01:36:09** And advertising is much more strongly correlated with

**01:36:15** continual and constant growth than membership programs are.

**01:36:19** And so I think you're just your brain is just starting to feel out the edges of like,

**01:36:24** oh, what do these different things mean?

**01:36:26** Like now I have a business that that's balancing these two aspects

**01:36:30** instead of just having a business that's advertising dependent.

**01:36:34** What does that mean for the kind of content that I'm producing

**01:36:37** or the way that I think about shows?

**01:36:40** And like that's something that you have to figure out for yourself.

**01:36:42** But it does just change the way you think about stuff to in this shift.

**01:36:50** Be much more focusing on.

**01:36:54** The membership side of it and the like the direct relationship with the audience

**01:36:59** than the advertising side of it.

**01:37:01** And then similarly, I also want to make sure that I'm shifting my attention

**01:37:06** on shows correctly, which shows need the most effort, which shows require it

**01:37:13** and making sure that I am serving all of those properly.

**01:37:17** Mm hmm. So that's like another part of this.

**01:37:21** Also, like in shifting my finances, like thinking about where my money is spent.

**01:37:25** Mm hmm. Like, I think this is just a good time to do that.

**01:37:28** Mm hmm. It's time risk for everybody. Right.

**01:37:31** And it's just making me think, OK, now that I'm spending money in different places,

**01:37:35** because I'm not traveling, stuff like that.

**01:37:38** I'm just making sure that I have different sets of savings.

**01:37:42** I'm making sure that like just thinking more about where that's going now.

**01:37:46** Right. Like it's just a time to reset that, which I think is useful

**01:37:49** for everybody every now and then.

**01:37:51** I'm also shifting product creation for Cortex brand.

**01:37:54** So this has been a long time coming.

**01:37:57** We will have more to say on this in the future.

**01:37:59** But we've been working hard on what we've always spoken about,

**01:38:03** which was a version two of the theme system journal.

**01:38:05** Mm hmm. There is still some version one for sale, hopefully quite soon.

**01:38:11** But then that will be the last stock of the version one of the book.

**01:38:16** So we've been making tweaks for the journal and I'm now going to be much more

**01:38:21** involved in the day to day of how these things are actually produced and made.

**01:38:25** So that's been a big project, a very big project that I want to follow up on

**01:38:29** in the future. And the last part of the year of shift is to.

**01:38:34** So if I was going to bring one thing of the year of refinement into this,

**01:38:39** it will be a little bit about thinking about me in certain ways

**01:38:43** and the way that I brought it over into the year of shift is to shift my mental

**01:38:49** energy. So still trying to find time for myself somewhere in all of this, right?

**01:38:55** Which I still want to be able to make sure that I'm doing.

**01:38:58** But the place that I've landed on with the thing that I want to do the most now

**01:39:03** is in learning different technology things.

**01:39:06** So playing with apps and systems because I love to do that.

**01:39:11** And there's some stuff out there that I really want to dig into a little bit more

**01:39:15** that I just haven't been putting off for a while.

**01:39:18** Like what? Do you have a I'm sort of curious about what you the specifics of what you

**01:39:22** mean by this, if you can if you can say at this point in time, Microsoft Word.

**01:39:27** OK, right. But that's why I've been thinking about that.

**01:39:30** And then looking at stuff like notion, right?

**01:39:32** Like, why do people use it?

**01:39:34** Like, I mean, I want to know and the app drafts.

**01:39:39** I want to look into that a little bit more again.

**01:39:41** And look, I don't want to get into this now.

**01:39:45** I don't know if I'm ever going to want to get into this.

**01:39:49** But do I ever want to think about like, like like app development?

**01:39:54** Now, I don't want to do it, right?

**01:39:56** But I think I might want to at least just try.

**01:40:02** And this is probably not going to be this year.

**01:40:06** But with the stuff that Apple is doing around Swift and Swift UI, I kind of feel

**01:40:10** like if I was ever going to try, it would be kind of around now where there is a

**01:40:16** little bit of a reset going on.

**01:40:19** And, you know, I've had some like very basic ideas and I've seen a lot of the

**01:40:25** things that Swift and Swift UI can do.

**01:40:27** And I see when people say like, oh, like this is a basic project and it doesn't

**01:40:32** require that much code.

**01:40:33** And I'm looking at those things and like the ideas that I've had, it would fit in

**01:40:39** these, what's looked like to be simple applications.

**01:40:44** So there's kind of a thought where I'm like, well, if I'm ever going to try, maybe

**01:40:49** it's sooner rather than later.

**01:40:52** Now, I don't know if that's now.

**01:40:53** I don't know if that's in six months, a year or never, but it has just been in

**01:40:59** the back of my mind a little bit more.

**01:41:01** But I have other things that I want to get to before that.

**01:41:04** But these are the types of things where like, and again, like, you know, I think

**01:41:08** I was saying on the last episode that like, I felt iOS 13 kind of passed me by.

**01:41:13** Like I've really been digging into iOS 14 a lot.

**01:41:16** I'm just like really trying to understand it way more than I did with iOS 13,

**01:41:20** because that's what I love to do.

**01:41:22** And I actually benefit from knowing this stuff.

**01:41:24** I should know this stuff in detail.

**01:41:27** Yes.

**01:41:27** Being a domain expert in these sorts of things is a core competency that is

**01:41:31** valuable to you across many different properties.

**01:41:34** Yeah.

**01:41:35** So, you know, really just making sure that I'm spending that time, which is

**01:41:39** useful, but also stuff that I enjoy.

**01:41:41** So that's kind of a thing that I've been thinking about and looking at.

**01:41:45** There's also like a bunch of really weird new email products that exist.

**01:41:48** And I want to dig into those because why not?

**01:41:51** So like, this is like a thing that I want to do.

**01:41:53** Like when I have time, I want to spend that time learning in different ways.

**01:42:00** And that was part of what the year of refinement included.

**01:42:04** But what I've decided is if I'm going to spend that time, I want it to be things

**01:42:08** that I care about, but things that still do matter for my work, because if I can

**01:42:13** do that, you know what, I might make the shows better and that's what I want to do.

**01:42:18** Yeah.

**01:42:19** Yeah.

**01:42:19** That makes sense.

**01:42:20** That shift in focus of, oh, I'm not learning about the fancy or finer stuff

**01:42:27** at the edges, right?

**01:42:29** Like you want to, you want to spend more time on the stuff that's more core to you.

**01:42:34** That really does make a lot of sense this year as opposed to the previous theme.

**01:42:40** And yeah, I would also say if there's anyone listening who they're thinking

**01:42:43** about shifting their themes and they're thinking about computer programming,

**01:42:48** it's like, this is clearly another time to get started in that sort of thing.

**01:42:53** Like, like you said, maybe not this year, maybe next year, who knows?

**01:42:56** But like, it does feel very clearly that we're all on the edge of another major

**01:43:02** transition and like, this isn't a bad time to be considering that sort of thing.

**01:43:07** If it's on your horizon at all of just like, look into the

**01:43:09** technology in more detail.

**01:43:11** I think, uh, your shift theme is a good one.

**01:43:14** I think this is a good, I don't know, like.

**01:43:18** Adaptation in some ways of the refinement theme.

**01:43:21** Yeah.

**01:43:21** Like it's, it's less of a hard break than I might have expected, but I think that's

**01:43:26** very natural and there's, there's a way in which themes flow into each other.

**01:43:31** And I think this is a very necessary shift to happen right now.

**01:43:35** And I think this is a, this is a good decision.

**01:43:37** Yeah.

**01:43:37** I think the thing about the year of shift, which is different to the year of

**01:43:43** refinement is this is touching on every single part of my business in a way

**01:43:48** that year of refinement didn't like that.

**01:43:51** You know, I would be like, Oh, you know, if maybe I'll refine this or find that.

**01:43:54** But like the, the difference now in the second half of 2020 is I am making

**01:44:00** significant changes to every part of my business, right?

**01:44:04** All of it.

**01:44:05** Yeah.

**01:44:06** And that wasn't the case.

**01:44:07** So, you know, I've made more change in the last three months than I probably have in

**01:44:14** the last 12.

**01:44:16** Everything that I'm doing is undergoing some kind of change.

**01:44:20** And a lot of that change is starting from me.

**01:44:24** Yes, there are outside forces, but ultimately like I'm not having these things

**01:44:30** just happen, like I'm not letting the world just.

**01:44:35** Shake me up and then whatever it lands on, it's just where I'm going to go.

**01:44:41** Like I'm trying to take some element of control in it.

**01:44:43** This is where I'm going to guide it.

**01:44:45** And so that's the way that I'm dealing with this, right?

**01:44:48** Like just where we are in June, June, where we are in July of 2020.

**01:44:56** Right.

**01:44:57** Like, and so I've decided that like, all right, we're going to draw a line in the

**01:45:01** sand and I'm going to shift everything around.

**01:45:04** And that's where I'm going to push forward for the rest of the year.

**01:45:07** I feel like that's normally where we're at on the show, but we need to talk about

**01:45:10** getmoretex.com.

**01:45:12** Ah, yes, we do.

**01:45:13** Don't we getmoretex.com getmoretex.com.

**01:45:18** You bought a lot of domains.

**01:45:19** I bought a lot of domains.

**01:45:21** I bought a lot of domains.

**01:45:23** Not only did I buy a bunch of domains because we were talking, then the Cortex

**01:45:28** Animated, HMPetet put together a wonderful Cortex Animated, which included a bunch of

**01:45:33** URLs in that, which I then had to go and buy.

**01:45:36** Of course.

**01:45:37** So I have, I think maybe eight or nine getmoretex.com URLs.

**01:45:43** So find the one that works for you, I suppose, but go to getmoretex.com.

**01:45:48** If you are a member because you signed up at getmoretex.com, there's more

**01:45:53** text happening right now.

**01:45:55** See you in the more text, Mike.

**01:45:58** You're trying to come up with like a bunch of new catch phrases.

**01:46:04** Yeah, I am.
