# Cortex - 122: State of the Apps 2022
**00:00:00** Ready to go?

**00:00:00** I'm ready to go.

**00:00:01** State of the apps, 2022.

**00:00:04** Bum bum bum!

**00:00:05** Oh, okay!

**00:00:07** That's a good level of drama.

**00:00:09** I was last night, so I was thinking about the show last night,

**00:00:13** and I was like,

**00:00:14** feel a bit of pressure coming into this now.

**00:00:16** Yeah, me too.

**00:00:17** We do 12 episodes a year, right?

**00:00:19** And now two of those episodes,

**00:00:21** which is a quite significant percentage,

**00:00:23** which happen back to back, which I also don't like,

**00:00:26** I feel like there's a lot of importance on them, right?

**00:00:29** So state of the apps, and then I'm sorry to keep mentioning it,

**00:00:31** but yearly themes next time.

**00:00:33** I don't know, I feel like there's like a lot of pressure

**00:00:35** coming into these episodes now.

**00:00:37** You set these big traditions.

**00:00:38** Yeah, well, I refuse for there to actually be pressure on this episode.

**00:00:43** I was mainly doing the bum bum bum because it's finally here,

**00:00:46** and the last wall of defense before the theme episode.

**00:00:49** Truth.

**00:00:50** Like we've now breached it.

**00:00:51** We're in the end game now.

**00:00:52** Yeah, it's the end game now.

**00:00:54** So state of the apps.

**00:00:55** We've been doing this for a number of years now,

**00:00:57** and it was originally inspired by a blog post that you wrote

**00:01:00** many years ago in the same name.

**00:01:02** It's like, you know, if you kind of look in like a state of the nation,

**00:01:05** that kind of thing, what are the apps and services that we are using right now?

**00:01:10** What are the decisions that we've made over the last year

**00:01:12** that have led us to them if we've made changes,

**00:01:15** or why are we sticking with certain apps and services?

**00:01:18** And also what would we like to see change in the years ahead?

**00:01:22** We have a selection of categories that we go through

**00:01:24** from productivity to communication,

**00:01:27** and we have a really great lightning round at the end where we talk about

**00:01:30** all the little fun apps that we've been using in the last year

**00:01:32** that otherwise don't fit into those categories.

**00:01:35** One of the things we like to do in this episode as well

**00:01:37** is to share our home screens with each other,

**00:01:39** which I think is what we'll start with today.

**00:01:42** And then we can start diving into some of the apps,

**00:01:44** but maybe there's some interesting insights into each other

**00:01:48** that we can glean from our home screens.

**00:01:50** Who do you want to go first? Me or you?

**00:01:53** Yes. Well, actually, hold on a second.

**00:01:54** I need to reposition my backup recording microphone,

**00:01:59** which was on my desk, because it just dropped,

**00:02:02** and it dropped in such a way- I was trying to ignore that sound,

**00:02:05** personally. I didn't want to pay attention to the noise that had occurred.

**00:02:09** Right. But my backup microphone dropped in such a way

**00:02:14** that it perfectly hit my keyboard to stop the main recording on my computer.

**00:02:20** Do we have to start again?

**00:02:22** No, no. We're good. We're good.

**00:02:25** But you don't have a recording.

**00:02:26** Do you have a recording of me? You've got a local recording, so we're good.

**00:02:30** No, I don't have a local recording of you.

**00:02:32** You have the local recording of you. I have a Zoom recording of you.

**00:02:36** Yeah, but I have the backup recording of me talking.

**00:02:38** Oh, I probably shouldn't be waving around this local microphone.

**00:02:41** Oh, I should put this-

**00:02:44** I just said all this stuff about this episode's important to me.

**00:02:49** There's pressure to it.

**00:02:50** And you're fucking throwing microphones around

**00:02:53** to stop in your recording.

**00:02:54** Right. Well, no, but it's like this is an important life lesson,

**00:02:57** which is to click off the app that is recording so that I can't have accidental keyboard inputs.

**00:03:03** All right. Where are you recording now?

**00:03:06** I'm recording into QuickTime on the Mac, and I have a Zoom microphone on the desk

**00:03:12** as the backup recorder. So we're good. We're good, Mike. Don't worry about it.

**00:03:14** But you are recording again?

**00:03:16** Yes. I'm looking at it being recorded right now. I can see the little levels going,

**00:03:19** so we're all set.

**00:03:20** Why do you need to do this to me?

**00:03:22** I'm trying to get in a good mental space here.

**00:03:25** And you're fucking pushing the equipment around.

**00:03:27** I don't know how many more times we need to do this.

**00:03:30** This is still happening.

**00:03:35** Well, look, I'm trying to do the reverse. You're trying to be serious.

**00:03:38** I'm trying to lower the stakes.

**00:03:40** Right. So this is perfect as far as I'm concerned.

**00:03:43** So some excellent stakes lowering.

**00:03:47** So we're all set, Mike. Don't worry.

**00:03:48** So now I will ask again, who's going to go first with sharing their home screen?

**00:03:55** You want to do home screen sharing? I'm happy to go first.

**00:03:58** I actually think I want that. I think I need that.

**00:04:00** I just realized I don't have iMessage installed on the computer that I was going to do that.

**00:04:04** I don't even know how that's a possibility. I don't even... How do you not...

**00:04:07** How... Can you uninstall iMessage?

**00:04:10** Oh, and I'm just not...

**00:04:11** I'm just not signed in. We've had this conversation before.

**00:04:13** I don't want to have this conversation again. And as I'm saying these words,

**00:04:17** I'm remembering having said this before.

**00:04:21** Mike, I'm on the writing computer. Like, what's so hard to understand?

**00:04:25** Okay. I have airdropped myself the photos.

**00:04:28** I will send you all of the photos of all of my screens.

**00:04:31** We're going to start left to right.

**00:04:34** What is the name for that screen all the way on the left?

**00:04:37** I think it's still called the today view.

**00:04:40** I think it's still called that.

**00:04:42** I feel like that poor today view is...

**00:04:44** It's not long for this world.

**00:04:45** You think it's not long for this world?

**00:04:47** They'll change it up again. They've changed what that screen does like 17 times in the

**00:04:51** last six years. Like, that will change again. Because currently at that moment,

**00:04:55** it's basically just where widgets go. And they, I think, would prefer you to put widgets on the

**00:04:59** home screens.

**00:05:00** Right. Okay. So there we go. I think I've sent you all four in order from...

**00:05:05** Wow. There's some stuff I do understand here.

**00:05:09** Okay. Yeah. Well, so some of the stuff may seem confusing because we're also dealing with now

**00:05:14** we're in the world of focus modes and screens that can disappear and reappear.

**00:05:22** So we need to talk about that, like the focus mode stuff. And I'd thought maybe we would talk

**00:05:26** about it today, but I don't know if we're going to have time with everything else.

**00:05:30** So I make a promise to the Cortexons, we will talk about iOS 15 and focus modes at some point,

**00:05:36** if not today, because I do think it's important, but it might be too much for this episode,

**00:05:43** I think, unless you disagree with me.

**00:05:44** Yeah. I bet money on us talking about focus modes this time. And also with your intro,

**00:05:51** we have many things to discuss, but one of the things we have to discuss before the end is

**00:05:54** resolving our travel bet from last year. So we have to get to that at some point as well.

**00:05:58** Oh, I've got that in there. Don't you worry. The travel bet's in there.

**00:06:01** All right. So your home screens. So we have the today view, we just have a Calzones widget.

**00:06:05** It's the only one there. I'm wondering why does that widget not find its way onto a home screen?

**00:06:11** Why does it live there? That Calzones widget is the old school one. As far as I know,

**00:06:17** Calzones is the app by underscore. Oh, of course it can't live on the home screen.

**00:06:22** Right. It can't, right. So he made this app, I think basically at your request years ago about

**00:06:28** not having a good app for tracking different time zones. And I still prefer Calzones for

**00:06:36** planning meetings across time zones. Has a great UI. The app itself has a great

**00:06:40** UI to work out with. Yeah. Like the killer feature of Calzones for me is that when I

**00:06:44** look at the widget, okay, great. Now I know what time it is in all of these different places,

**00:06:48** but much more importantly, the app itself allows me to just scroll back and forth to see like when

**00:06:56** it's 1pm in London, what time is it everywhere else? And like I'm in a position where often

**00:07:03** enough I'm trying to coordinate moving meetings slightly across time zones. And that kind of

**00:07:09** thing is just, it is so, so helpful to not do the mental math of the time zones and to just be able

**00:07:16** to look, be like, okay, if we move it two hours this way, you know, what does that mean for the

**00:07:20** three participants in this call? So I really like Calzones and that app is old. I'm not sure if

**00:07:29** underscore is still maintaining it or not, but it is one of the old style widgets. If it's available,

**00:07:34** he's maintaining it, but I don't, that would be my assumption, but I don't know what the future

**00:07:39** holds for it because he's a very busy man. He's missed a widget. Yeah. No, he's, he's the widget

**00:07:44** wizard now. He puts the Smith in widgetsmith. Yes, he does. Very successful with widgetsmith,

**00:07:50** his most loved app child at this point. So that's why Calzones lives on my today view,

**00:07:56** because that is the only place where I can put the widget because it is one of the old style

**00:08:00** widgets for Apple. And I just, while in widgetsmith, he does have a time zones thing. When you tap on

**00:08:07** it, it takes you into widgetsmith and it doesn't have the same UI as Calzones does. So that's why

**00:08:13** Calzones is the last remaining holdout on my today view for old style widgets, but I still use it

**00:08:21** quite a lot. I don't like to ask for things of friends in public such, but I will say I would

**00:08:30** love it if widgetsmith had the same time zone moving thing as Calzones does. Yeah. I mean,

**00:08:37** Mike, how hard can development be, right? He just has to just copy and paste some code.

**00:08:41** You've already done it once, you know, how can it be? Very hard. I'm sorry, Dave, we love you.

**00:08:49** It just selects the text that is code and you hit, you know, Apple C and then you go over to your

**00:08:55** other app and you type Apple V and it's done. What more could there possibly be? It's funny to

**00:09:00** me that you call it Apple. Oh God. Yeah. That's command. Yeah. No, it is. It is command. I think

**00:09:06** that is a holdover from back in university. I had to use one of the old Apple systems where they used

**00:09:10** to, they used to use Apple as the little command icon. It was like, this system is so dumb. I hate

**00:09:15** it. I hate these apples everywhere. And I think somehow it got into my head that like the little

**00:09:19** commands are called Apple still, but it makes you sound like one of those people that call Apple

**00:09:23** Mac, you know, they call the company Mac. That's what that sort of makes you sound like when you

**00:09:27** say stuff like that. Mac, they make the iPhone. Yes, that's that is what they make. So I'm noticing

**00:09:33** here, I'm expecting this is a focus mode thing that maybe it's not actually good. There's just

**00:09:37** not really a lot of apps on your home screens. There's just a lot of widgets. I am really

**00:09:41** confused about this set of screens. The information that you're showing is weird to me, which makes me

**00:09:49** think you're in a focus mode right now, because I've got a bunch of widgets. So we've got screen

**00:09:53** one, timer, e-car batteries and OmniFocus. That makes sense to me, right? Is knowing you as a person

**00:09:58** and like the things that you like on your devices, like those widgets, I actually that makes a lot of

**00:10:03** sense. And I can imagine that like, now that we're far removed from widgets, you're pretty happy that

**00:10:08** like you don't have to put those random folders on the home screen anymore. And you can just put all

**00:10:12** the information that you want, right? I bet you like that. Yes, I do. I do like widgets. I like

**00:10:18** seeing the information on the home screen. I feel like I have a lot of conflicts about widgets,

**00:10:23** but overall, I do think it's an improvement. It's way better than just having dumb app icons on the

**00:10:28** home screen. Yeah, I just noticed you're a big 5g boy. Look at you. Do you get lots of speed? Do you

**00:10:34** do you work at the speed of light now? Yes. Oh, I don't have 5g. I never wasn't my whole life going

**00:10:40** to change because of 5g. There was a big presentation about 5g is the best G. My plan

**00:10:45** with my providers, I like my plan. Like I like what I get for it for the money. And so they won't

**00:10:50** give me 5g unless I change my plan. I'm like, well, I'm not changing my plan. I don't want 5g,

**00:10:55** you know, it's like, I don't need it. I can just stay with what I got. Thanks. All right. So then

**00:11:00** you got the carrot on one screen and a bigger carrot on another and another. Oh my goodness.

**00:11:05** There's three carrot widgets. Four. There's four carrot widgets. Wow. You love weather as much as

**00:11:14** you love 5g. They're everywhere. Okay. Okay. Okay. So look, let me try to explain this because this

**00:11:19** again is a byproduct of the weird focus mode stuff. I'm glad you're giggling at five carrot widgets.

**00:11:25** The first home screen is functionally the thing that I'm looking at 99% of the time. I like the

**00:11:32** time tracking up at top up. I like the time tracking up at the, oh my God. I like the time

**00:11:38** tracking. Just knock the microphone over and start again, Gray, you know. I like the time tracking up

**00:11:44** at the top. So to have an overview of what's going on, that's great with Time-Ree. The current

**00:11:50** weather batteries widget, love it. And then at the bottom I have OmniFocus, although there's some

**00:11:56** interesting things to say about OmniFocus later. This is basically the information dashboard of

**00:12:02** the things that I actually care about. And then as has been the case for years and years, when I

**00:12:06** want to open a specific app, I just, I'm in the habit of just searching for it. That's what I do.

**00:12:10** And I have my three little shortcuts at the bottom, one of which is to open the camera.

**00:12:14** One of which is my little replacement for Launch Center Pro from years ago, where I just have some

**00:12:21** common shortcuts for various things. So that launches a shortcut, is it? Yeah. The little

**00:12:26** rocket ship is the homage to Launch Center Pro. I don't remember exactly how those things work.

**00:12:30** Does that open shortcuts or does it just pop open a UI for you on the screen for you to tap?

**00:12:34** I know. The way I have it set up is it opens up a list of like, here's the five things that I can

**00:12:39** tap on and I can launch any of those. Does it open shortcuts to do that or did they come down

**00:12:43** like a notification? It comes down like it's a notification and the notification has a bunch

**00:12:49** of options in it. It's like, it's nicer than Launch Center Pro could have been, right? Like,

**00:12:55** I know there's no way that they could have done what shortcuts can do, but it's just,

**00:12:59** this is the way it should be. Yeah, I completely agree. It's the way that it should be. I just,

**00:13:04** since it does come down from the top, it's one of those things like, oh, I have to reach my finger

**00:13:08** all the way to the top of the phone. Right. And I kind of wish it came out of the icon. Yeah,

**00:13:14** that would be real good. That would be real good. They should do that. Yeah. So I just have some like

**00:13:19** frequently used things in there. And then the little hourglass icon is my most used time tracking

**00:13:25** timer, which is just for, I call it loading. And it's basically when I've finished doing some task

**00:13:31** and I haven't yet fully decided what's the next thing that I'm going to do, I just hit that as

**00:13:36** like, oh, I'm loading up. What's the next thing that I'm going to do? Like it's my way of tracking

**00:13:40** in between time. So that's why I just have it there. Cause I just want it to be like dead easy

**00:13:45** to just hit of like, yeah, that's the number one timer. What does the camera one do? The camera one

**00:13:49** opens the camera. Why does it, you want visual consistency in the doc there? I want visual

**00:13:53** consistency. Like I can't have an icon. Okay. Okay. No, no, no. That's the camera icon. Okay,

**00:13:59** but when the other two were shortcuts, icons, it's extremely important to maintain visual consistency.

**00:14:05** You know what? I agree with what you've done here. It would look really weird to have the standard

**00:14:11** camera icon next to it unless like, because it just would look strange. Right. Otherwise,

**00:14:17** unless you, you custom made icons that looked similar to the camera icon for the rocket ship

**00:14:22** and the hourglass. You know what I mean? Like they were black on the inside. So they matched

**00:14:27** the camera icon. Yeah. There is one real downside to doing it though, which is I'm going to send you

**00:14:32** a screenshot, which is when I hit that camera icon, you get the notification, but here's the thing.

**00:14:39** I do get the notification, which I don't mind. It loads the camera basically instantly. Like it

**00:14:45** doesn't go through shortcuts like it used to. It loads the camera instantly. The camera is ready to

**00:14:51** go. But then the notification comes down that says you ran a shortcut that opened cameras. And

**00:14:59** when that notification comes down, the camera no longer works for a second. Oh,

**00:15:05** it like walks out the view. Right. Oh my God. That's the worst. That is the worst.

**00:15:13** It's it is very frustrating. Just get someone to make you a rocket ship and an hourglass that

**00:15:19** visually look like the camera and then you can change them up, man. Wait, what do you mean? What

**00:15:24** is your suggested solution here? All right. So move the actual camera icon to the dock and make

**00:15:31** custom shortcuts. Oh, right. So make a rocket ship that's black on the inside instead of white. And

**00:15:39** an hourglass that's black on the inside instead of white thematically. They look the same. Do that.

**00:15:44** Oh, that's really intriguing. Look at me. I'm improving lives today. You are improving lives

**00:15:49** today. I'm actually just going to call on someone in the Cortex audience to do that. Hey,

**00:15:53** someone. No, you're going to get a thousand of them. Don't do that. But then I can just pick the

**00:15:58** best. Okay. Okay. Leave it in the Cortex subreddit. But that is a great idea, Mike. That is some real

**00:16:05** like galaxy brain stuff there. Like wait, just invert the whole thing. That's perfect. I really

**00:16:12** like that. I just finished the cappuccino. So I'm at like peak recommendation. My brain is on 100%

**00:16:18** functionality. That's great. I'm glad I have you in this great capacity to improve my life. It's

**00:16:22** because I consider today to be an important day. I don't push my microphone over, you know?

**00:16:26** So there's one more move on. There's just something funny about like just the way that data is

**00:16:30** displayed in your time re widget. It says Cortex three times, Cortex, Cortex, preparation, Cortex.

**00:16:35** And I know you've got like projects and tags, right? I get why that's happening. But it's just

**00:16:39** very funny to me. Cortex, Cortex, preparation, Cortex. Yeah. This is a holdover from, I think

**00:16:45** this is the thing that everyone goes through when they start time tracking is that you start being

**00:16:51** overly precise with what you want to track. And so I used to have like five different ways that

**00:16:57** I tracked Cortex. It was like, you know, Cortex preparation, Cortex recording time, Cortex editing.

**00:17:04** And I think I had like Cortex admin slash chats. And this is just what happens when people time

**00:17:10** track. Like you start overly precise, then you go, what the hell am I doing? Like, why do I actually

**00:17:16** care about this level of detail in Cortex? So I still do just out of muscle memory, have the only

**00:17:23** distinction between like Cortex preparation and Cortex everything else. But yeah, so like in the

**00:17:29** backend, there's all these five different ways to track Cortex and with a ton of other projects,

**00:17:33** it's the same thing, but it doesn't matter. I only ever just look at it at the whole like,

**00:17:37** how much time does Cortex take up in my life level? This is why I have like, so I have projects

**00:17:43** and tags and my tags are only shows. So I have like show prep and podcast recording and podcast

**00:17:51** editing their projects and then they are tagged with the relevant show. That's that's all I do.

**00:17:54** Right. Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah. Time tracking is a whole other thing that I really should go

**00:17:59** into it and really clean it up. I think this is a good time to do that. Like I just have a lot of

**00:18:05** weird legacy stuff in there. You know why we've never done this? Why? Because there's no competitor

**00:18:11** to toggle. So there's never been a reason to start over. Right. Like, like the great to-do list

**00:18:18** migration. You just, you tidy up, nuke your entire life and begin again. Because toggle,

**00:18:24** because toggle has an API, it means we can use one apps, like the very wonderful Timery.

**00:18:29** So like there isn't really a need to go in and clean up the data. Like if Timery had their own

**00:18:35** service, which I think they should look at one day, but that's like a whole different thing.

**00:18:39** Right. I'm not recommending that of them, but I wouldn't mind it at the same time. Then you could

**00:18:44** go in and like, all right, now I'm going to go in and I'm going to tidy up as I'm moving from one

**00:18:49** to the other. But because we, when we moved from the terrible toggle app to Timery or like a set of

**00:18:55** like hastily made shortcuts to Timery, we didn't need to change anything because we just logged in

**00:18:59** with the old API. So like all the data is the same. So as you say, it's not like if you change notes

**00:19:05** app or if you change to-do app and you're doing like a manual migration, you're like, you start

**00:19:10** looking at it and like, why do I have these two projects? They could be one project and you move

**00:19:14** all stuff together. Yeah, that's a good point. All right. So that's screen one. So then on screen

**00:19:18** two, there's more weather. Okay. So here's the thing to explain. The idea with the focus modes

**00:19:23** is that you're able to have different screens for different things that you're doing. And so this

**00:19:30** second screen, if you notice, it has a real theme. If you're looking at all of the apps on the bottom.

**00:19:35** I can see it. Yeah. It's very thematic to I'm shooting a video. Yes, exactly. So more Texans

**00:19:42** will know that I took a trip out to Cherokee, North Carolina. And like one of the things that

**00:19:49** I was just thinking about with my phone is, Oh, I can just set up a screen that can be the default

**00:19:55** screen. If I know that I'm going to be out all day, and then this just has everything that I could

**00:20:01** possibly want on it. And if you are outside filming, the weather really matters. So I have

**00:20:07** carrot at the top, show me like the map of like our clouds coming, which I actually find more useful

**00:20:12** than the like the little rain alert thing. I can see like what time, you know, is like the blue

**00:20:18** hour or the golden hour for filming. And at the top, I have the hours for like, what's the weather

**00:20:23** going to look like? And then at the bottom, I just have a bunch of apps that are related to filming

**00:20:27** of like, here's the camera, here's Filmic Pro, all the DJI stuff, GoPro, and two really little fun

**00:20:34** apps, which are basically like lightning round apps, but they are Sunseeker and Moonseeker,

**00:20:38** which are like AR apps, which will show you, you can use them to look around and see where

**00:20:43** will the sun be at a particular time or like where will the moon be at a particular time,

**00:20:48** they work really great. So this is the just, Oh, I can use this as my home screen if I know that

**00:20:55** I'm just going to spend the day trying to film something. So I really don't ever look at this,

**00:21:01** most of the time it's just hidden. But for going through the home screens, I was like, Oh, I might

**00:21:05** as well just show all of the home screens that exist. And so that's what this one is for it.

**00:21:10** Like it serves a functional purpose, but it is not like a home screen on my phone, unless it's very

**00:21:17** particular circumstances. Okay, I didn't know we were doing this. All right. So you have this set

**00:21:23** up as a typically will only appear under certain focus modes, right? But you've included it for

**00:21:29** this image sharing. Yeah. Well, I thought like this makes sense, right? If we're going through

**00:21:33** right, we have to talk about, I didn't think what are the different things. So that's why I knew

**00:21:38** we're going to talk about focus modes because I was going to talk about focus modes going through

**00:21:42** this. All right. All right. That's good. This is good. Cause now I've just taken another screen

**00:21:45** show cause I'm working on, I haven't finished this like a screen, but I'm working on one. So when I,

**00:21:49** when I send you my note, I'll send you that one too. This is what I thought this was, which is why

**00:21:54** I was surprised it was in the list. But I guess most of the time what you say, this isn't available

**00:21:59** to you. You're in like a certain focus mode for shooting video. And then this will pop up and is

**00:22:04** this your main home screen when you do that? Yeah. What I, what I actually have done, what I think

**00:22:09** just works best is I just, I do that trick that you taught me where you hold down on the little

**00:22:14** dots that indicate the different home screens. And I use that to just turn off the home screen

**00:22:20** at the start. And so then this becomes like the main home screen. So you're not using a focus mode

**00:22:25** for that then. I am not explicitly using a focus mode for this one. No. You're just taking advantage

**00:22:30** of this feature that was added because of focus modes. Yes. That's exactly right. So like this

**00:22:36** does technically live as like the screen that's off to the side a lot, but I just never, ever

**00:22:43** swipe right on my device. Like I just don't ever do it. I'm only swiping over to the today view to

**00:22:49** sometimes open cal zones. I'm looking at the one that has the time tracking and OmniFocus in the

**00:22:54** batteries. And I just never swipe over under any normal circumstances. So if I just disable this

**00:22:59** first home screen, then this one that's like video shooting mode is the one that pops up as like,

**00:23:05** now this is your home screen. See, I do think I want to have a bigger discussion about focus

**00:23:09** modes later. Cause I still haven't really fully understood the way that I want to use it. It's

**00:23:15** actually something I want to work on over the next few weeks. But this is a good intro to it.

**00:23:20** No, but like let's talk about it now. Like we are talking about it. We are. I'm just saying like,

**00:23:25** I think it will become apparent to you when I share with you what I've got is I'm still working

**00:23:29** out how I want to use it. So like right now, all right, we're doing it right now. I have a regular

**00:23:33** mode, right? I have a recording focus mode, which all it does is just turns off all my notifications.

**00:23:39** It's like a, just like a beefed up do not disturb. And it just allows messages from Adina and slack

**00:23:46** messages from Kerry, our vice president of sales. She got promotion. And so like that,

**00:23:52** cause they're really, when I'm recording, I, if Adina needs me, then she can get to me.

**00:23:56** And if Kerry needs me, sometimes it can be like for an Adam about to record. So I kind of want

**00:24:01** those messages and it just shuts everything off. And I, what I love the most now is that syncs

**00:24:06** across all my devices when it's turned on. I think that's great. So I don't get notifications

**00:24:10** on anything. And then I also have a fitness one. So when I'm working out, it turns off notifications

**00:24:15** from absolutely everybody. And I have it automatically turn on during certain workout

**00:24:22** types. I used shortcuts to do this because I don't want it to turn on whenever the Apple

**00:24:27** watch thinks I'm working out, because sometimes that's when I'm walking around and then I don't

**00:24:32** need, I don't want it to turn on then, but shortcuts allows you to set a personal automation

**00:24:39** and choose the workout types that you will activate the focus mode for. The issue is

**00:24:44** shortcuts send you notifications when it does it, because it just loves to send you notifications

**00:24:48** about everything. But that way it's like only when I'm doing the types of workouts where I consider

**00:24:53** that I'm working out is when it will activate itself. And then when the workout stops, it turns

**00:25:00** off that focus mode and goes back to my regular focus mode. So that's, that's all I've set up

**00:25:05** right now. But what I'll show you in a bit is I want to set up a travel one, but I haven't fully

**00:25:09** done it yet. Like I want to dig into it more, but I just, I haven't had the time to really sit down

**00:25:15** and be like, what do I want all of these different home screens to look like and under what

**00:25:19** circumstances and you know, what people and what apps like I haven't really, this is what I'm

**00:25:24** saying. I feel like I want to do more with it, but I haven't yet done that. That's why I think

**00:25:29** it might come up again in the future. And also I was thinking you would have done a lot with it,

**00:25:33** but it seems like maybe you have it. Yeah. Well, so it's interesting to me to hear that this

**00:25:38** is your experience. Cause I, I've basically had the exact same experience with the focus mode stuff

**00:25:44** of I've used it. I like it way better than the old system, which was terrible. And I complained

**00:25:52** about multiple times for being buggy and not working, but yes, it's like, I don't, there's

**00:25:57** one thing I can definitely blame it on, but there's another thing, which is just, it's been

**00:26:02** such a weird year that it's, it's almost felt like, I don't know, like I don't have it solid in

**00:26:10** my mind of what do I want all of the various modes for either. It's also surprisingly complicated

**00:26:17** for a feature that Apple has made. I think to its advantage in a way, because you can really get

**00:26:23** granular, but setting one up is a lot of work. Yeah. I agree. Like I'm very glad that they did

**00:26:30** it. Obviously for this, for this kind of like notification stuff, I want a ton of options,

**00:26:35** but it does make thinking about it very strange. Even some of the things like I've had a hard time

**00:26:43** recontextualizing. It's like, okay, so the do not disturb while driving is now a focus mode. And I

**00:26:50** have a bunch of options for this. Like what do I want that to mean? And obviously I mostly haven't

**00:26:56** been doing a bunch of driving, but when I was in America, I was again. And that was, that was again,

**00:27:01** one of these moments of like, I need to think through what I want this to be. It's just been

**00:27:06** very funny. I feel like the focus mode stuff is almost like a project for next year after the

**00:27:13** themes episode. I've just been very aware of, I haven't dug into it too much. I could imagine

**00:27:21** this being a thing where like the themes help inform the focus mode because it's setting up

**00:27:29** how I want my device to be. Yeah. I like that. See, this is what I was getting at when I was

**00:27:33** saying, I think we're going to talk about this later is because I, I feel like I've just started

**00:27:39** and I'm hearing like, like our friends, David Sparx, Federico Vittigio, they're like really into it

**00:27:44** and they're using it a lot. And like they have like, I know Federico is doing this. He's always

**00:27:49** in a focus mode of some kind. And I find that really interesting. So like, I want to spend

**00:27:55** more time with it, but I feel like I haven't been able to really understand what I want.

**00:28:01** And so, but, and I think it's because I am in this moment right now where I'm working out what I want

**00:28:07** from work in general. And as is obvious, like from everything we talk about on our show,

**00:28:14** our devices are extensions of the way that we work. And so they mirror that. So if I'm not sure,

**00:28:21** my devices aren't going to be sure either. And also like in the last few months, the devices that

**00:28:26** I'm using, especially in the last year, and it's all changed so much, like something I wanted to

**00:28:30** talk about as we get into the apps is I'm really back on the Mac for basically all work now. And

**00:28:38** so what I'm looking for with the apps that I'm using is different to before. Now, I only really

**00:28:43** want to get into something if it's truly cross platform. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. I completely agree.

**00:28:49** So I have had that same experience of like the last half year has been a very strange in between

**00:28:57** time. And that has made thinking about the focus mode surprisingly difficult. And yeah. So it's

**00:29:04** very interesting to hear that you've had the same response. And like, I ultimately want to be doing

**00:29:10** the same thing, which is my phone should be set up in such a way so that I am constantly in a focus

**00:29:16** mode of some kind, but I haven't done that at all. What I've actually just done is I've, I basically

**00:29:23** have only two focus modes that I'm really using. The first one I call core and that's to protect

**00:29:31** like the core working hours in the morning. That is trying to replicate what I used to be doing

**00:29:37** where I tried to lock down the phone in a whole bunch of ways of like before 2pm, I don't want to

**00:29:43** hear like anything from anyone and just like lock down the device as much as I could. What's great

**00:29:49** for you is just how easy it is to set up a focus mode that does that. Yeah. It's really very, it's

**00:29:54** like the default, which is really interesting. Yeah, it is. It is interesting. And I do like

**00:29:59** the way that it works. I've also not run into these weird problems of like blocking critical

**00:30:04** apps. Like it used to have so many problems with Safari and now those don't exist anymore,

**00:30:07** which is fantastic. I love that it syncs across devices. That's really great. So I have like

**00:30:12** core turns on the minute the sleep focus ends is the way I have it set up. But then that just sort

**00:30:19** of turns off at the end of the day. And ultimately I do want to, I want to have that thing of like

**00:30:23** deliberately moving from mode to mode. But just because of this being in this in between time,

**00:30:29** I somehow have like had a hard time being very precise about like,

**00:30:34** what do I want my phone to actually be like on weekend Wednesday? I don't know.

**00:30:38** Right. Cause in theory, you should have a weekend Wednesday focus mode that like on

**00:30:42** Oh yeah, totally.

**00:30:43** Just sets your devices to be like, all right, no slack, no, none of this. It's all like

**00:30:49** entertainment applications and you know, all that kind of stuff. Like in theory,

**00:30:52** that's what you want. But yeah, you gotta, you gotta really sit down and work with it. And I

**00:30:57** actually think it's an interesting feature in that way of like, as long as they continue to,

**00:31:01** to make sure that it's a going concern, which I think they were cause it's pretty,

**00:31:06** it's a pretty important part of the system because they wrapped it up, disturbed into it as well.

**00:31:10** Right. That I think it's something that you will grow with as you're, as your, as our lives change

**00:31:16** and our work changes, be like, I think I need my devices to work this way now. And so we can have

**00:31:23** better ways of customizing and tweaking them. So I think there's a lot of promise there,

**00:31:28** but it's, I think it's something that's going to take a little while to realize fully.

**00:31:32** The only thing I don't love about it is I don't love that the notifications still go to that slide

**00:31:39** down lock screen. And it's just, it's a habit I've been trying to break myself of. I used to slide

**00:31:45** down that screen a bunch. And now I know like, Oh, when I'm in the core mode, the notifications are

**00:31:51** still hiding there. So this has been a kind of right of deliberate training of just try to never

**00:31:59** use that. Like try never to slide down the screen. Cause you'll just see the notifications there. I do

**00:32:05** like the way that when you were in the focus mode, they sort of minimize them. So it doesn't show as

**00:32:09** like a ton of icons. It shows as like a brief little description that's way better, but I still

**00:32:15** wish there was a way to completely hide them. I think you can. So if you go into the focus

**00:32:21** mode and you go to lock screen, there's a toggle for silence notifications, which says show on lock

**00:32:28** screen. And I think you can turn that off and it will get rid of them. Yeah. So I have the show on

**00:32:34** lock screen turned off. Oh, when you pull up, they still come up. Okay. Yeah. But when you pull down,

**00:32:40** right, they still show up there. And it's just like, it's a funny thing. I never really

**00:32:45** tuned into the fact that I have the habit of doing that to check the day and date. And so then

**00:32:52** you still like see, Oh, here are the notifications. Like I wish you could properly hide them from

**00:32:56** there. But honestly, like the system is so improved from the old system. That is a relatively

**00:33:01** minor complaint. But so I created this like core working focus mode. And then I have one other,

**00:33:09** which I really do like, and this is going to be the screenshot that probably confuses you the most.

**00:33:15** Which is the third screen over. Yeah. I don't get this one at all. Carrots, widget Smith,

**00:33:22** reminders, and the widget Smith one Eastbourne is receding. I don't know what this is. I have no

**00:33:28** idea what this means. Mike Eastbourne is receding. Like what, I don't understand what's unclear about

**00:33:34** this astrology. It says 1256 1850 132 725. I'm assuming that's sunrise and sunset.

**00:33:43** No, it's not sunrise and sunset. It's the tides. That's what that. Okay.

**00:33:50** You in tune with the tides? Great. No, no. Okay. So the only other focus mode that I set up

**00:33:57** is I made a holiday focus mode. You got a boat now. No, I do not have a boat.

**00:34:04** That's great. Selling the high seas of Eastbourne.

**00:34:10** So my wife and I took our first trip on our own somewhere. Uh, and we went to Eastbourne,

**00:34:17** which is by the sea. And so while we were on holiday, when we're there, the, like the tide

**00:34:23** coming in and out really matters about like what you can do. Like, can you go out to the beach or

**00:34:28** can you not go out to the beach? It's one of those beaches where it's like a really long in and out

**00:34:34** based on what the tide was. And I just had this funny thing where when we got there, we asked the

**00:34:39** guy at reception at our hotel, like, Oh, when, when does the tide come in and out? And he goes,

**00:34:44** Oh, I've never been able to figure that out. It's like, dude, you work at the reception of a hotel

**00:34:51** on the sea front. Like, shouldn't you have a tide clock on the wall? Or it feels like this is

**00:34:57** something surely all the guests must ask you, but I guess not. So while we were on our first holiday

**00:35:03** together, I put this as a widget on my home screen because it's like, I wanted to know when

**00:35:08** was the tide going to be out and when was the tide going to be in, but I've left it there,

**00:35:13** not because I care about knowing if Eastbourne is currently receding or not, but just as an actual

**00:35:20** reminder of, because you can't label the screens, like this is the screen that should appear when

**00:35:28** the phone is in holiday mode. And so I set up holiday mode so that it can finally do the thing

**00:35:35** that I was never able to do before, which is on holiday, only people I have labeled as family

**00:35:41** should be able to send me messages of any kind and everything else should be silenced.

**00:35:46** You could use widget Smith to just create a text widget that says holiday and put that there,

**00:35:51** but maybe you prefer Eastbourne receding.

**00:35:53** Yeah, that's like an extra step. No, I'll just, I have this there just to remind me of what it is

**00:36:00** and I'll just swap it out. So you're going to be like on holiday in the south of France and you'll

**00:36:05** be like, oh, Eastbourne is receding. That's just going to be. No, well then if I need to know

**00:36:08** something about where I am in France, like then I'll swap out a different more useful widget for

**00:36:13** that one. So again, like this home screen is always there. It's just always your third home screen.

**00:36:18** So no, this one doesn't appear most of the time on the phone. This only appears if I put it into

**00:36:24** holiday mode. That's the way this one works. But you enabled it for these screenshots. Gotcha.

**00:36:29** Yeah. So I just wanted to show you all the different things. And then also this is such a

**00:36:32** like such a dumb little thing, but I feel like it comes up on holiday a bunch is I do have the

**00:36:37** reminders widget there because I feel like constantly on when you're on vacation, you remember

**00:36:42** that like you need to get something from the local boots or like there's always like these weird

**00:36:47** little things that pop up. It's like, I don't want to use OmniFocus that's way too heavyweight

**00:36:51** for this. So I did just want to have like, Oh, here's the like errands list.

**00:36:56** You don't want to see the work tasks. Yes, exactly.

**00:36:59** You keep saying holiday, I'm going to call it vacation. We'll just do a nice little swap there.

**00:37:03** So when you're on vacation, that's not the way that should work at all.

**00:37:05** I know, but it is the way it's working as though that we could do about it. When you're on vacation,

**00:37:10** you don't want to see like, Oh, when I'm back from my wonderful vacation, I've got all this stuff to

**00:37:14** do. So you just put it in reminders. That's a good idea.

**00:37:18** Yeah. So I just, I just have it there. It's nice and easy to be like, Oh, we need to get an extra

**00:37:21** thing of toothpaste, you know, or we need to pick up some aspirin or something like that.

**00:37:25** Like just those kinds of little one off things that happen that are also when you're mentally

**00:37:30** in holiday mode are real easy to forget of like, Oh yeah, we want it. We needed to do that before

**00:37:35** the pharmacy closed or especially when you're completely not used to taking trips. So it's like,

**00:37:41** you never have much like my wash bag is empty. It's like, hang on. It's supposed to be stuff in

**00:37:45** here. Nope. It's all gone. You used it when you couldn't buy deodorant during lockdown.

**00:37:51** Deodorant out of the wash bag and use that. So this is my screen for that mode. And

**00:37:56** yeah, makes sense. Again, I do really like that with the focus modes of like, this was

**00:38:01** constantly the problem before of being on vacation and not wanting to get any messages from anyone

**00:38:09** but my wife. And it was just always a real frustration that I had to have the phone like

**00:38:13** completely open to everyone or totally shut down. Those were the only options. So I'm really,

**00:38:18** really grateful to the focus mode team for enabling this kind of thing, because it really

**00:38:22** did make the trip so much nicer to know, Oh yes, my wife can message me in the morning because we

**00:38:28** might be a part and then we're trying to figure out where to meet up. But I don't have to worry

**00:38:32** about getting random messages about work that are just going to derail your thoughts when they

**00:38:37** shouldn't otherwise. So that is currently how I'm using the focus modes. But I will just say

**00:38:42** the one other thing that has put me off slightly is ideally I want to have way more of these custom

**00:38:50** screens, but I feel like Apple system for adding widgets and moving around apps. I feel like I'm

**00:38:59** constantly building some crazy Jenga tower. Yeah. That if I make any mistake, like it totally

**00:39:06** messes up everything else that I've been working on. It's really frustrating and was genuinely

**00:39:12** off-putting. And we'll destroy the next screen that you weren't doing anything to. And like now

**00:39:17** the widgets are over there. Like, yeah, they need to work on making this a better experience. It's

**00:39:23** felt like it's needed for a while, but now, especially with the widgets and that you're

**00:39:28** encouraged to make more of them. It's like, Oh my God. Yeah. And that's why I say like a Jenga tower,

**00:39:33** because like if it was just hard on the screen that I'm working on, that would be fine. But the

**00:39:38** fact that if I want to put in a big widget, I can knock three home screens worth of stuff completely

**00:39:44** out of alignment is infuriating. And it really makes me not want to work on these individual

**00:39:50** screens. I remember I was trying to set up a home screen for like, Oh, this is the way my phone

**00:39:55** should work when I'm in admin mode. And I did something and I messed up a bunch of my screens.

**00:40:00** I was like, F this, like, I'm just going to leave it as I've got these three screens. They're good

**00:40:05** enough. The end, I will work on this later when I know more clearly what it is that I want to do.

**00:40:10** But yeah, I would definitely put that on my wish list for the next version of iOS is please give

**00:40:17** us a better way to design these home screens and to move around widgets and apps because the current

**00:40:22** way is so unbelievably infuriating. And then your final screen is just a folder that says

**00:40:30** shortcuts. I'm very confused about this one. Okay. So you may remember that when you search

**00:40:37** for things using the default Apple pull down search menu, they prioritize apps over shortcuts.

**00:40:45** So things that live in the shortcuts app are relatively low on the list when Apple is showing

**00:40:50** you what you're searching for. So anything that I want to have a shortcut that I'm going to frequently

**00:40:56** run, which is very often timers, I make it into a shortcut on the home screen. Right. And now the

**00:41:04** phone counts it like an app. So it shows up way higher on the list when I search for stuff.

**00:41:10** So that whole folder is just full of things that are like, these are shortcuts in the shortcut app

**00:41:16** that I run frequently, but I've made them exist on the home screen so that they show up higher on

**00:41:23** the list when I search for it using spotlight. So that is the only reason this folder exists.

**00:41:29** I normally just have it hidden, but that's just like a little trick for getting the shortcuts to

**00:41:33** show up higher, which I do find it frustrating. It's like, Hey, Apple, you know, I run this shortcut

**00:41:38** multiple times a day. Maybe you should put it at the top of the search results when I search for

**00:41:43** it, but they don't, it'll still always be below a bunch of like weird junk that Siri has found for

**00:41:48** me on the internet that I don't care about. But if it exists as a fake app, then it can and will

**00:41:53** often be at the top. So that's why I do this. So that's everything I've shown you mine, Mike,

**00:41:59** you need to show me yours. Oh boy. So I'm sending you two now, I'm sending you one image,

**00:42:03** which is all one big image, which is my home screen as it is. And then I see your iPad. Oh,

**00:42:08** God, it's your iPad. Oh no, it is not your iPad on screen. That's what I was like, Jesus Christ.

**00:42:13** Four iPhone home screens like put next to each other, right? So you've got the visual consistency.

**00:42:18** Look how fancy you've been going to do this for yours. It will be in the show notes so that people

**00:42:22** just see it in one long image. So you can kind of just see everything in situ. And then I've sent

**00:42:27** you a second one, which we'll talk about afterwards, which is a focus mode, home screen that I'm

**00:42:31** building that I'm not done with yet. Okay. All right. So you use the today screen much more than

**00:42:37** I do. So you've got a bunch of shortcuts over here. Yeah, that's where all my kind of, that's why I

**00:42:40** just have a bunch of shortcuts widgets there. They launched my most used shortcuts. And I've set that

**00:42:46** up manually because I just know the stuff that I use the most and things you move in and out of

**00:42:50** there as necessary. That's actually a good idea though. I hadn't thought of maybe also just putting

**00:42:56** some shortcuts there. That's really interesting. I might steal that. Because they run just immediately

**00:43:01** when you tap the thing. You know, it's not like other widgets where it opens the app, right? The

**00:43:06** shortcuts widget is different to other widgets. So I tap any of those blocks and it fires off that

**00:43:11** specific shortcut. That's the widget. That's just a folder of things that you have selected. Is that

**00:43:15** how that works? Yeah. Okay. Cool. So I create folders. Like I have a Mac folder now as well.

**00:43:22** Mac focused shortcuts, which we might talk about in a bit. So like, you know, I have like a couple

**00:43:25** of widget folders in the shortcuts app. And then I just sell like the ones that I want. I have one,

**00:43:30** which is like a general one, which is that one on the top. Then I have one, which is of a bunch of

**00:43:34** time tracking actions, which you see at the bottom there underneath it, which is a smaller, smaller

**00:43:38** selection. Hmm. I have just added that as a widget to my own phone to remind me to play around with

**00:43:45** that later. I think that's a really good idea. Okay. And so on your main home screen, you have

**00:43:51** a bunch of apps and then what's it? Fantastic. Cal at the top. Yeah. That's a stack. Carrot

**00:43:56** weather lives under fantastic. Cal. Ah, okay. How many copies of carrot weather do you have on your

**00:44:00** phone? Just one, believe it or not. Just one. Only one. Oh, how do you know what the weather's like,

**00:44:08** Mike? He's the forecast one that like the forecast one's really great because that's the widget that

**00:44:13** changes like it in the morning, it shows you a whole day, like today's weather in the evening,

**00:44:19** it shows you the next week's weather like, and if it's raining, it shows you the rain. Like it's

**00:44:24** such a great widget. I just use that one widget in carrot weather and it lets me know what the

**00:44:30** important weather thing is. I don't need to think about it. Yeah. No, that is great. And that's,

**00:44:34** that's the one that I'm using as well on my home screen. Like it's, it's carrot weather. I do have

**00:44:40** one major complaint about you this year, but it is an amazing app and like just that predictive

**00:44:45** widget is so nice. Like if I feel like it really does, it does hit that magical, just show me what

**00:44:51** I want to know at any moment. Like it hits that sweet spot really well. Okay. So that exists in

**00:44:55** a stack with fantastic. How, how, how good do you find iOS is it's switching between the two of those?

**00:45:03** I feel like it's pretty good. I feel like most of the time I get what I want, but I know they're

**00:45:08** there. So it's very easy for me. Like I mindlessly swipe them to open them because

**00:45:13** fantastic. The way I open my calendar is from that widget. Like I removed the fantastic app

**00:45:19** icon off my phone, right? Cause that made sense to me. And I, I open my calendar a lot and I don't

**00:45:25** feel like I'm endlessly swiping, you know, so it's either it's there most of the time when I want it,

**00:45:30** or it's just a swipe tap. And it's just like not a thing that I even think about.

**00:45:34** Hmm. I should try, I should try those stacks more. I don't have any stacks on my phone,

**00:45:38** but I think, I think maybe I should give that more of a try.

**00:45:40** I've created a bunch of like logical stacks. So the timer re-widgets on the bottom, right?

**00:45:46** Underneath that is a shortcut, which is called plus track time, which you'll also see on the

**00:45:52** today view. And what that does is it's a shortcut that allows me to manually add tracked time. Like

**00:45:59** if I've been working on something and didn't set a timer up for it, because I don't do what you've

**00:46:03** done. I don't know if you still do this, but I'm always got a timer going. Sometimes I'm like

**00:46:08** working on something like, Oh, I didn't set a timer for this. So I just add 15 minutes to a project,

**00:46:13** you know? Oh, interesting. I didn't know that was a thing that you could do in time, Marie.

**00:46:17** You have to, you can do it with shortcuts. You have to build a shortcut to do it, right? And they

**00:46:21** have a thing where you can like add a chunk of time. And I just do like, you know, I have a

**00:46:26** shortcut, which is basically what is the current time, uh, reduced by 15 minutes, basically,

**00:46:32** at the start date and then add from start date to now in the time.

**00:46:36** We shortcut thing. Hmm. That's interesting. I also, I have to say, I, I quite like aesthetically,

**00:46:42** the way you have the widget on the bottom, right. And the apps going around it,

**00:46:46** I think that's a good look. It looks pretty good, right? I do like that. And it's the

**00:46:50** time Marie one is there because it's what I interact with for the most is either opening

**00:46:56** or looking at time Marie or doing that time tracking thing. Um, when it comes to like tapping

**00:47:01** on a widget, and I like having it there. And I also, I aesthetically like the apps kind of like

**00:47:06** wrapping around them. Yeah. Yeah. It's Apple does not give you a lot of options for the way you

**00:47:12** want to have things look. And I feel like, Oh, that does look good though. I like that. I might

**00:47:16** copy that style for a different home screen when I, when I eventually decide to put in all the time

**00:47:21** to, uh, sort them all out and I'm willing to spend an entire day carefully constructing a Jenga tower.

**00:47:27** I might want to steal that as a, as a layout. So that's really nice. So yeah, I feel like

**00:47:33** this is relatively unchanged in terms of the apps that you normally use.

**00:47:38** Yeah. I think the things that might be different is like craft, maybe craft. Yeah. We'll come to

**00:47:43** craft later on. I want to talk about that, but the apps themselves are very similar and so is

**00:47:48** the layout. Some of the stuff that I noticed changes. I think train beacon is new. That is a

**00:47:53** stack of two widgets, uh, that I have on top of each other that tell me the train times between

**00:47:59** the station that I use for home and the station I use for the studio. Oh, okay. Really love that app.

**00:48:05** Like, and so basically it's just telling me when my next trains are for the locations that I'm

**00:48:10** going between all the time. And then the third page is where I'm trying some stuff out. When we

**00:48:15** were doing our fundraising for St. Jude, we had a wonderful group of people in the relay discord

**00:48:22** created a widget that tracked the fundraising. It was really awesome. So I had that on that

**00:48:27** third page. That is pretty sweet. And so then I just had that going. And then when the fundraiser

**00:48:32** was over, I wanted to like basically use that third page as, let me try out some widgets. So

**00:48:38** I've got fitness. I actually really liked the fitness widget. I think it's laid out really

**00:48:42** nicely. That medium one, it gives me all the information I would want. Then I've got a timer

**00:48:47** one. That's all of the stuff I've tracked this week. And then a craft widget as well,

**00:48:52** which I'm just trying out. So there's just some stuff that I'm playing around with. That's what

**00:48:55** I use that third screen for. Okay. So that's a craft widget. I was, I was wondering about

**00:48:59** the cortex brand one. I was like, yeah, that doesn't look familiar to me at all. That's the

**00:49:02** four most recently changed documents or notes in craft. Ah, okay. Okay. And you can tap each of

**00:49:09** those and launch them, but the titles of those notes are full of secrets. So they've been blocked.

**00:49:14** Yes. That's why they've been pixelated. Of course, since this is of course the place where we're

**00:49:18** talking about the apps, I do have a public quest for timer. Which is I wish that this week thing

**00:49:23** could instead be the last seven days. Like I don't actually really care about this week. I really

**00:49:30** care about what the last seven days were. I feel like that widget would be significantly more

**00:49:35** useful to me if I could do it that way instead. Cause it's like a rolling thing rather than a

**00:49:39** fixed thing. Yeah. And it's, it's like, it's weird when it wrote, when the week starts and now my day

**00:49:44** and the week timer are exactly the same. Like I just, I don't really understand how I would ever

**00:49:49** want to think about it in terms of a week. You can change it, gray. I just looked and you can do it.

**00:49:55** No way. Really. Yep. There's an option for last number of days. Oh my God. This is magic. Okay,

**00:50:02** great. Look how quick they added that. This is what makes Joe such a good developer creator of

**00:50:06** time Marie. As we're saying it, the app is changing. Now, if you, if you can do settings on widgets,

**00:50:11** right? So you, you long press on the widget, edit widget, and one of the options is duration. And

**00:50:16** there's a bunch of durations there in the bottom. One of those is last number of days. And you just

**00:50:20** put the little number of days in. Wait a second. Where the hell are you seeing the durations? I

**00:50:24** don't see that at all. The time period is this week or today. I don't have this option in my app. I

**00:50:29** don't know. Are you on summary report? You have different options than me. You want the most

**00:50:33** recent version of the app. Are you on some kind of beta? Do you have a fancy beta? I am on a beta,

**00:50:38** but I don't know what the shipping version of the app is. Well, I can tell you right now,

**00:50:43** the shipping version of the app does not have that you have sneaky beta access.

**00:50:49** There we go. I can, I can show you right now. I don't have that, but you know what?

**00:50:52** It's coming. Great. I'm thrilled about that. Yeah. Okay. Sorry. Are we using the same widget though?

**00:51:01** Like I don't know if it's the same widget. Yeah. We're using, we're using the same widget. All right.

**00:51:06** Sorry, Joe. I keep doing this. I forget. You're spoiling. You're spoiling, uh, his, his surprises

**00:51:13** for what's going to come, but okay. That's great. Okay. Good, good to know it's, it's going to be

**00:51:17** there. Fantastic. I love it. Oh man. Well, there you go. It's coming. Timery is best. Go get

**00:51:22** Timery. Timery is the best. I'm going to talk about in a bit. I feel like I shouldn't keep doing

**00:51:26** what I keep doing here, but we're going to talk about Timering again in a bit. All right. So do

**00:51:29** you have any more, there are, I think you could have more questions about this, about the apps

**00:51:33** on the screens, but I'm going to talk about them. So there's no point getting to them. Yeah. Well,

**00:51:37** I am also just wondering about the like trialing out the activity app. Like that's quite interesting

**00:51:42** to me. It feels like a different sort of mic. I was just wondering if you have anything to say

**00:51:46** about that. Um, I don't really want to get into it too much, but I am a much more fitness oriented

**00:51:51** person than I've ever been in my adult life. I know. Okay. Mike Hurley is in the best shape of

**00:51:56** his life right now, but that's the end of that. Okay. All right. Maybe we'll talk about that next

**00:52:01** time. Maybe the thing is, I feel like over the years I've spoken a lot about different fitness

**00:52:07** things that I've wanted to do and try, and then I do them for a while and I stop and then I get

**00:52:12** embarrassed because I spoke about them. You know what I mean? Yeah, I get that, but I think that's,

**00:52:18** that's fine. Like, that's not some unique experience you're having there. I think that's,

**00:52:25** that's a, that's a very common experience. Like, I'm taking my health more seriously.

**00:52:30** If you want to feel better, like I have fallen off the wagon from the swamp of uncertainty time,

**00:52:38** and then I landed in America. Like I fell off the wagon of health so hard. Like you cannot believe

**00:52:44** how hard I fell off that wagon. Like that's, that's fine. Like this is, this is what happens. I always

**00:52:50** say like what matters is you get back on the wagon. So like, I'm just, I'm happy to see the activity

**00:52:56** app there. And if you say that you're in the best shape of your life, like that's great. Like,

**00:53:00** I'm very happy about that. I'm feeling very good. I don't, I don't have RSI anymore. Nice. I haven't

**00:53:06** had an RSI pain or back pain in like three months. Like I'm doing more frequent exercises. I'm going

**00:53:11** to guess that you're physically stronger than, okay. Yes. There we go. Right. Okay. So you're

**00:53:16** doing strength exercises. I can bench now, boy. Oh wow. That's very exciting. I'm very happy to

**00:53:22** hear that. So yeah, that's, this has to been a thing in my life, uh, over the last few months.

**00:53:28** And the fitness widget is on my home screen as a constant reminder for me. And it's why I wear an

**00:53:35** Apple watch every day now. And I've been wearing an Apple watch every day since like September.

**00:53:39** And it's been, I think before then actually maybe like July or August. And that was like the start

**00:53:43** of it. And now more frequent exercises and pushing myself in new ways and stuff like that. So

**00:53:49** it's been a big change in my life and I'm feeling pretty good about it. And, uh, yeah.

**00:53:53** Do you leave on the Apple, um, the like coaching stuff that the watch does where it kind of pings

**00:54:00** you throughout the day? Yeah. Like how much of, how much of Apple notifying you about your health?

**00:54:04** Do you leave on? I didn't know about any of that. So I have the trends thing turned on,

**00:54:10** if that's what you're talking about, but yeah, in, okay, in the watch, there's a setting,

**00:54:14** which I think they call like coaching, but it just, uh, it tries to harass you. If you look like

**00:54:20** you're being lazy on a particular day. I was just wondering if you, if you leave that stuff on or if

**00:54:24** you don't leave that stuff on, I have no idea what you're talking about in the watch app under

**00:54:28** activity. There's a thing called daily coaching. Oh my gosh. I had notifications off. I just pressed

**00:54:34** allow notifications and a hundred settings appeared. Yeah, there you go. All right. I'm going to turn

**00:54:40** all these on. I've didn't, I had no idea any of these existed. This was from when I was wearing

**00:54:45** an Apple watch and didn't care about fitness. So one day leave me alone. Uh, but now, all right,

**00:54:52** I'm going to leave these on and see, see what that's all about for a bit. Oh my God. That's so

**00:54:55** funny. It was like, I was like, I have no idea what you're talking about. There's no options here. And

**00:54:59** then if I catch like bang in the hundred. All right. So they're all on. I'll see what that's like.

**00:55:04** I would recommend turning off the stand reminders because they're just

**00:55:08** pointlessly annoying in my take of it. But like the daily coaching ones are sort of interesting.

**00:55:13** It's also interesting that when I first fell off the wagon, the, the Apple watch was like trying

**00:55:18** to be real encouraging like, Oh, it seems like you haven't worked out in seven days. Like maybe you

**00:55:23** want to, Oh, you haven't done anything in two. Oh, your activity is way down. And then after a month,

**00:55:29** it was like the Apple watch just gave up and stopped. Well, cause you got the new trend now,

**00:55:34** right? Even worse. And the trend is you don't do it. So

**00:55:40** yeah, it was like, Oh, Apple watch. I didn't like it when you bothered me, but somehow I like it

**00:55:45** even less when you just gave up and stopped harassing me into go exercise dude. Um, but yes,

**00:55:53** anyway, I think they are, they are annoying, but I think that they are usefully annoying. Like that's

**00:56:00** kind of their purpose. So anyway, there you go. You have some options of notifications to play

**00:56:04** around with. And I said, then I sent you another one, just a singular home screen. This is the,

**00:56:10** Oh, right. Travel focus mode home screen that I'm working on. I've not used it yet. And I'm trying

**00:56:16** to see if this is something that I would like. And so this includes a bunch of widgets. I've got a

**00:56:22** Tripsy widget and a flighty widget, uh, batteries and notes and those notes ones. It's a stack of

**00:56:28** things that I'm going to use. It includes like an Apple note that has my passport information

**00:56:32** about it. And it also will have is an Apple note for the relevant trip that I'm on and the like

**00:56:39** PDFs of trip information that I keep in an Apple note, just so I've got them locally downloaded.

**00:56:46** That's also an interesting idea with a note that's a particular folder. I like that for travel. That's

**00:56:52** a, that's a really good idea. So like the notes widget, you can choose like his, just, just have

**00:56:57** it be this note. And it just gives you quick access to that. I think this is another idea of

**00:57:01** yours that I am going to steal because when I was traveling, I thought like, Oh, the only thing that

**00:57:07** I really need is flighty. So I swapped out, I think I swapped out OmniFocus for flighty and had that

**00:57:14** listed, but something for like, I'm traveling right now, particularly with that notes folder of like,

**00:57:20** here's all the, I had just various instructions for here's how you need to properly reenter the

**00:57:26** UK and like the paperwork and stuff like, yeah, that, that, that feels like it's useful to have

**00:57:31** a different mode where I can just have quick access to that kind of thing. And this one is like

**00:57:36** active travel. I'm, I still want to set up like a vacation one as well. So like this is, yeah, I'm

**00:57:41** on the move. Oh yeah, no, I totally get it. That's a, that is a different mode from I'm at the

**00:57:48** location and chilling out is, is, is different from I'm on the move, which is also why I see it

**00:57:54** almost feels like aspirational or inspiring there to have the Hawaiian airlines app icon in the

**00:58:01** bottom by just like something pleasant to think about. Basically, this is the spots where that

**00:58:06** will swap out depending on where I'm going, like the airlines that I'm using. And so they're just

**00:58:11** like two airline apps that I have installed. And so I put them on there. I've got British Airways

**00:58:15** and Hawaiian airlines. And then it's like wallet, which is, you know, you gotta have the wallet,

**00:58:19** Google maps, Instagram, camera messages, Slack, and then make regular doc. That feels pretty,

**00:58:25** pretty set for me. Like I kind of, I think I kind of like it and I will be trying it out soon

**00:58:29** enough. We've taken a trip soon, so I'll let you know how that works. Yeah. I'm literally,

**00:58:34** literally adding United airlines and a few of my other travel apps to a screen to remind me that

**00:58:40** this is a thing that I want to set up in the future. I really liked this idea. So I am going

**00:58:44** to copy this from you. What is Tripsy again? That's the one where you plan the itinerary for

**00:58:50** the trip. Is that correct? What that app is for? Yeah. We spoke about it before and you said you

**00:58:54** liked it, but the one thing it didn't have that you wanted was a map of all the things that you

**00:58:57** want to go to on. And they have since added a map option. So you can view all of the things that

**00:59:03** you want to do on the map. Yeah. No, but you know, my map girl, Meg Frost added what I wanted. Oh,

**00:59:09** yes. I forgot about that. Apple maps, the most interesting and exciting app on the phone. And

**00:59:17** I'm not even joking about that. I love Apple maps. And so, yes, now I have, now I have hundreds of

**00:59:23** dots all over the world that I've added to Apple maps and Apple maps keeps bugging me. They go,

**00:59:28** Hey, you seem to have added a lot of locations. Are you okay with us using this in our database

**00:59:33** to improve maps? I'm like, no, these are all my secrets. State of the maps. State of the maps.

**01:01:43** We will start with productivity and obviously the most important productivity app is your

**01:01:49** Todo app or your task management app. And I have gone through a huge change this year that I have

**01:01:56** neglected and that I have resisted talking about until now. I wanted to wait and talk about it now

**01:02:02** and I have moved from OmniFocus back to Todoist. Interesting. Yeah. Because I listened to last

**01:02:08** year's show and you were, I think moving from Todoist into OmniFocus at that point in time.

**01:02:13** And so I was a few months in. Now you have moved back. And now I have moved back.

**01:02:17** So I moved back to Todoist about six months ago. And I've been very happy since I had a couple of

**01:02:23** things that changed for me. One is I felt like OmniFocus was too complicated for what I was doing.

**01:02:31** I think that I ended up in a situation where I was having to add too much metadata to a task

**01:02:38** for the system that I was using. And really all I needed was very simple, just a list of projects,

**01:02:44** is some buckets. I don't need projects and tags. I thought I might like all of that, but then

**01:02:49** ultimately it wasn't what I wanted. You know, it's like, oh, I had all these tags and I'll create

**01:02:53** all these perspectives and they can show to me at different times. And I can have these like

**01:02:58** overviews or I never used it. What I use and all I ever use is a list of tasks like chronologically.

**01:03:07** All of my tasks just on a, what am I doing over the next seven days or whatever. And what I have

**01:03:14** always enjoyed about Todoist is their view of this is endless. So it shows you easily the next few

**01:03:21** days, but you can just keep scrolling forever and continue to get that on like a, like a list calendar

**01:03:27** kind of view of all of your tasks. And really that's all I want. I also really missed the natural

**01:03:34** language entry everywhere. You know, like that's why I have that on the iPhone. I have that on the

**01:03:39** Mac and I could just add the tasks in natural language. I think I kind of like that I can add

**01:03:44** tasks into the application, just into the application. Like for me on the iPhone, especially,

**01:03:50** I had to end up creating a shortcut to just add a task simply to OmniFocus, like adding a task in

**01:03:56** the OmniFocus app is a real to do in a, not in the way that that is a thing you don't want to do.

**01:04:02** It's always a real to do. Why did I pick the exact wrong phrase to use? My brain is so stupid.

**01:04:09** And I honestly, I find Todoist's UI so much more consistent on the platforms that I use. Like we

**01:04:14** spoke about this at the time that the OmniFocus Mac app feels like it's made a different company.

**01:04:20** Yeah. And I've kind of been leaning back towards simplicity. So they are the reasons that I went

**01:04:27** to Todoist, but there is another reason I moved from OmniFocus. So OmniFocus currently have a new

**01:04:35** version of the application in beta and I've been playing around with it. And yes, it's in beta,

**01:04:40** but ultimately I think OmniFocus are moving in some directions that I don't think of for me

**01:04:44** from like a visual perspective and a layout perspective of the app that over the entire

**01:04:52** period of the beta process, I think they are making some decisions that are not what Mike wants.

**01:04:59** And so I think that ultimately I'm not going to be happy with the new version of OmniFocus.

**01:05:05** And so I've decided, I decided pretty early on to be like, I'm going to remove myself from

**01:05:11** something that's going to happen to me before it happens to me. Yeah. Yeah. UI changes can be

**01:05:18** even subtle ones, real devastating sometimes. To get a bit nerdy about it, Omni have decided

**01:05:24** to make the next version of OmniFocus completely out of SwiftUI. Like they are using SwiftUI

**01:05:28** for this. Right. And I'm not convinced that SwiftUI is ready for an application as complicated as

**01:05:35** OmniFocus. Interesting. And there are parts of admittedly the beta, right? They're still

**01:05:40** working it. I would say it has gotten a lot better over the period of time, but I feel like sometimes

**01:05:45** like I tap things and they just don't do what I want or tap targets are way too small for the way

**01:05:51** that I use the application, which is mostly looking at a list of tasks. It feels like it's not really

**01:05:58** best in that view anymore. So what I'm sure it will do once they get it to a point where they're

**01:06:04** happy with it, it will bring a level of unification to the app's user interface across all the

**01:06:08** platforms. It's kind of the point of SwiftUI, but I just, I don't think it's for me. And now I'm

**01:06:17** much happier back on Todoist again. I tried OmniFocus, I tried to complicate my system to give me more

**01:06:23** data to therefore potentially make me more productive. It didn't do that. And I felt like

**01:06:29** ultimately I was working with something that was looking for more from me than I was willing to

**01:06:36** give it. Where Todoist is much more simple for me and also from a user interface perspective,

**01:06:42** I prefer it and I especially prefer it to where I think OmniFocus might be moving towards.

**01:06:48** That's interesting, you know, because I'm not a fancy beta boy like you are. So I'm not on the

**01:06:54** OmniFocus beta. Just looking at screenshots, it doesn't look that different, but this is one of

**01:06:59** those things where I think screenshots don't give you any sense of how does it feel to actually use.

**01:07:05** So I'm just on the regular OmniFocus for my data.

**01:07:09** They've had it in beta for a long time. And I think it's because they know that what they're

**01:07:12** doing is like a big, big job. And I'm not, what I'm, I'm really want people to, to listen to what

**01:07:18** I'm saying here in that I am using an unreleased version of the application, right? I'm not saying

**01:07:24** that the app is going to be bad. What I'm saying is the decisions that they are making, I don't

**01:07:30** think are what I want from the app. And so I've decided to like cut my losses, but you know,

**01:07:36** I know that they have a very wide and open beta process so they can get feedback from people.

**01:07:42** And so they've made a bunch of tweaks to the application, but just like the main view of the

**01:07:46** app that I like is what I described in Todoist, which is here is a list of tasks on a like

**01:07:52** chronological view. In the new version of OmniFocus, the way it is shown, it just,

**01:07:59** it looks more like now here's one project of tasks. And that's not what I want. I want things

**01:08:06** divided up with date more. And I like to see like my tags there. And when you have, when I was using

**01:08:12** OmniFocus, I was using multiple tags and then tags go over multiple lines. And it's like, it,

**01:08:17** it looks too busy and it's not broken up in the way that I wanted. And maybe that works for some

**01:08:22** people. I don't think it works for me. And I think that just that view, which is important to me,

**01:08:27** I think is going to have changed too much. And I don't know, I don't know if that's right for me

**01:08:32** going forward. Yeah, no, that makes sense. And I do think visually the one problem that OmniFocus

**01:08:38** has always had is just too busy. Like I do think I called it before like redundant information

**01:08:47** syndrome of like, they show you the same thing like three times. It's, it's always been a problem

**01:08:53** that the app has had visually. And so I can see that if they've changed the way some things look,

**01:08:59** like if you use tags a bunch, the way they display those tags, if it's just not the way

**01:09:04** that you were thinking about them can be a real problem. So I totally get it. Like it makes sense.

**01:09:09** And if Todoist is working better with the way that your brain thinks about things,

**01:09:13** which is like, you want an infinite list scrolling off into the future, then, then go for it. I feel

**01:09:18** like this for you is a little bit like that time that I tried running and I gave it a real go. And

**01:09:22** then it's like, no, I can put this aside. And I know that I will never go back to this. Like I

**01:09:27** tried it once and I never have to worry again. I think that is exactly it. You were saying stuff

**01:09:34** and it sounded really interesting and I was like, all right, let me try it. And I tried it and I was

**01:09:37** like, I don't work this way. Yeah. And now you know, like you never have to wonder about OmniFocus

**01:09:42** again. Like it is totally not for you. You're still OmniFocus, right? All big OmniFocus all the time.

**01:09:48** Yeah. I am. I think this is what's so funny, Mike.

**01:09:57** That sounded very sure. You sounded so sure then.

**01:10:00** Well, it's been, I don't know if you're aware, Mike, but it's been a funny time,

**01:10:05** roughly, let's say the last 18 months or so. Yeah. And just one thing I am aware of is I have just,

**01:10:16** just to be clear, what I'm about to say is not good. I have totally fallen out of the habit of

**01:10:22** actually using a to-do app. Oh boy. Yeah. I just, I think it's-

**01:10:27** Are we about to cancel the show? It's done now?

**01:10:32** Yeah. No, this is the end of everything. No, I think it's just a byproduct of life being very

**01:10:41** compressed in a way. So yeah, it's not a thing that I was intentionally doing, but I think if

**01:10:48** you were tracking like, how often am I actually using OmniFocus or any to-do app to like tick off

**01:11:03** things as I'm going versus doing the thing where I'm like retrospectively cleaning up what I have

**01:11:10** done, like that has definitely been on a downward trend for the last 18 months or so. And then

**01:11:17** particularly over like the last, I would say three to four months, like my to-do app usage has been

**01:11:26** near zero in an actual effective way. Part of that is because I've just recently taken a bunch

**01:11:32** of time off of work. So like, I don't really need to use a to-do app, but even still, it's just an

**01:11:37** interesting, I think byproduct of the times. I don't expect that this is a long-term trend,

**01:11:43** but I would say never has OmniFocuses hold on me been less than at this very moment. I'm very aware

**01:11:52** that like I need to get back into this, but I have wondered if this is a, maybe if this is a good time

**01:11:59** to reevaluate the tools that I use. I think this is the perfect time. Yeah. So maybe-

**01:12:05** You're never going to do it unless you do it now.

**01:12:07** Maybe this is a good time. Like I think after Christmas, I'll maybe take a look at like all of

**01:12:14** the various options and see what's out there because I just, my OmniFocus task list is like

**01:12:21** not actually representative of anything in the state of my life. Like that's always one of the

**01:12:26** tricky things with to-do apps is keeping them in parallel with where are you really? What are you

**01:12:32** actually doing? And so yeah, this is just something that I do need to change is, oh, I've

**01:12:37** fallen out of this habit, which is like a core habit for keeping life going. And I need to pick

**01:12:44** this back up, but yeah, I think I need to wait for this funny transition time to be over in order to

**01:12:50** do that. So yeah, that's why I kind of look at this as, I don't know, it's a very strange time to be

**01:12:56** doing state of the apps is like, I do feel like I'm at the end of this weird transition time,

**01:13:03** or it'll really be over like after Christmas. And then I just, I think I am going to be doing

**01:13:09** like a bunch of reevaluation of several things. And like, I don't expect that I will switch away

**01:13:16** from OmniFocus, but I'm just aware that like this is a good time to do another survey of the landscape

**01:13:22** of what's out there. And I still say that the concept of defer dates is for me, the absolute

**01:13:29** killer feature of OmniFocus. And I just don't really see anything else that does that. But

**01:13:34** if people do have other apps that they like that are aware of that concept, I might be interested

**01:13:39** in just seeing in the subreddit, like, Oh, what's out there? And I'll take a look at everything in

**01:13:43** a couple months. So I still technically use OmniFocus to track my projects, but it's not very

**01:13:49** active in my life. And in a weird way, I have actually just been using reminders for some of

**01:13:55** the time sensitive stuff that I have to remember, mainly because I don't like natural language input,

**01:14:01** but it is so easy to tell Siri to remind you about something at a particular time. And so that's

**01:14:09** like this weird fallback I've been using for some critical things where it's like, Oh, I absolutely

**01:14:14** have to do this tomorrow. And then I'll just speak out loud to the ether and tell Siri to remind me

**01:14:20** about this thing at a particular time tomorrow. But yes, I need to get back into to do apps pretty

**01:14:25** seriously, because this is not a great habit to have fallen into. Yeah, that's interesting. I can

**01:14:31** see why it's happened, right? Because you say you've been away for a bit. And also it is a time

**01:14:36** of the year when you might think about things a little bit differently. Right? Yeah. And it's

**01:14:40** also been, I think, a byproduct of several really intense video projects in a row, where when

**01:14:46** something feels like it is consuming 100% of your life, it feels almost weirdly superfluous to put

**01:14:54** a bunch of tasks in a task manager, because it's like, this is the only thing I'm thinking about.

**01:14:59** Like I can't possibly forget any of the things that I'm working on. Like this is the only thing

**01:15:03** in my life. So I think that's partly also what has been the contributing factor is really intense

**01:15:10** projects. And then also just a break from working on stuff and has left me and I like, oh,

**01:15:18** I should probably just nuke my whole OmniFocus database, because it doesn't represent reality

**01:15:22** and start over. But if I'm going to do that, then that also makes sense as a time to look

**01:15:27** around and see what's available. So I'll put that on my to do list to check out to do apps.

**01:15:32** I'm very keen to hear this, how this goes. I want to follow up on this, because if there's other

**01:15:40** Hey, look, if there's other cool to do apps out there, I want to know about them.

**01:15:43** Yeah, for sure. Last year or so has been a note taking quest for you. I'm assuming, you know,

**01:15:50** Obsidian is the note taking app, right? Like Obsidian forever, Obsidian, Obsidian, we love it.

**01:15:58** Notes. What are they, Mike? No one knows. Nobody knows what notes are. Yeah. So obviously I've

**01:16:06** talked about Obsidian a lot. I think the actual big deal thing here is not about notes,

**01:16:13** but it is that Obsidian has slowly, slowly taken over and become not just the notes app,

**01:16:23** but it has also become my writing app. So it has dethroned Ulysses as the app that I am currently

**01:16:32** writing all of my scripts in. We were talking about UI changes. This is one of those things

**01:16:37** where last year Ulysses made a like relatively small UI change, but it just totally killed the

**01:16:45** way that I use the app. And I just, I just found it really, really frustrating. And the more I was

**01:16:51** using Obsidian to take notes, the more I kept thinking, well, I can also just sort of write

**01:16:58** the scripts in here as well. And while it is not perfect as a writing app, there are a bunch of

**01:17:05** things that I would want it to do differently. It does work better for me than Ulysses does after

**01:17:12** their change to hide a bunch of information from you. I will say you're jumping ahead,

**01:17:17** writing as a category later on. I will ask you questions about this then. Okay. Right now we're

**01:17:22** talking about notes. We have a very strict order around here. Oh, okay. I'm so sorry. I didn't,

**01:17:27** I didn't realize I didn't mean to be jumping ahead. You're ruining the chapters, right?

**01:17:32** We're in notes now. You set this order. I didn't set this order. I have nothing to do with these

**01:17:38** show notes that we're going through. I have, I have typed nothing here. No, no. You set this order

**01:17:42** when you created the blog post. What? Like six years ago? I'm not beholden to past me in any way.

**01:17:47** I don't care what order he set for things. Well, then you're beholden to current me.

**01:17:51** We're talking about writing later right now. Okay. We'll talk about writing later. That's fine.

**01:17:57** So I will just say, yes, notes. What are they? No one knows. I still don't know what notes are.

**01:18:02** Obsidian is definitely the app that I use for notes. I'll also say that I've been really

**01:18:09** impressed this year with just Apple's notes app. I've been just using it a surprising amount.

**01:18:17** It's not anything in particular. I just feel like they have added slowly, slowly, a bunch of little

**01:18:22** features that have all added up to I'm using the notes app a lot more. I particularly just,

**01:18:30** such a killer feature, but I love being able to tap the pencil on the screen and it brings up a

**01:18:36** note and you can just start writing on that. It's really, really nice. And when I was teaching my mom

**01:18:43** magic, uh, when I was there visiting her, it's like I constantly had the notes app out. And so

**01:18:48** I would like draw little diagrams of like, Oh, here's how this works. And I wrote up a bunch of

**01:18:55** notes for her about how different parts of the game work. It's like, and I just, I never even

**01:19:00** thought twice about it. Like I will just 100% use the actual notes app to do this. So it's very

**01:19:06** interesting, but notes has been, it's not completely yet, but it is very clearly

**01:19:13** cannibalizing my good notes app that I used to use. I'm so confused. What goes into good notes

**01:19:21** or notes that doesn't go into obsidian? Look, Mike, don't start asking questions. You don't

**01:19:27** want the answers. Don't start asking questions that your feeble mind can understand. Yeah. If

**01:19:33** we're going to start talking about subtle constant again, then I rescind my question.

**01:19:37** We're not going to do that. Like, look, don't worry about what goes where. Okay. Like I have a

**01:19:41** whole squirrely system that makes sense to me. That's great though. Yeah. I'm happy.

**01:19:46** But so I'll just say like, I have been aware that the number of times I opened the good notes app

**01:19:53** over the last year has really started to fall off. And Apple's notes app is just slowly taking over

**01:20:00** that. And this trip to America, particularly when I was teaching my mom how to play magic,

**01:20:06** like I was just very aware that notes as the go to place to handwrite stuff and to draw diagrams

**01:20:14** and to make documents for her was just the no brainer winner all of the time there. So it just

**01:20:19** feels good. The tools are fantastic and they're nice and simple, but they have exactly what you

**01:20:24** need. Like the drawing stuff is really good. I love apps that integrate that though. So I use

**01:20:29** craft, right? Craft I've been using for everything really. It's a cortex brand. So I was using this

**01:20:35** in notion last time. And I spoke about looking at craft as an option, right? And I'm really

**01:20:41** happy about my choice. But like one of the things they do is like, you can draw stuff in craft,

**01:20:46** you know, using the Apple pencil and they use Apple's tools, which is a thing that developers

**01:20:50** can use as an API for, I think it's called pencil kit. So you get all of the benefit of that

**01:20:57** inside whatever app you want. And then the drawings live in line with the other things

**01:21:02** within the document, the note that I've got going on. And like, that's what I really like craft for

**01:21:06** it. It's so good at like multimedia stuff, images and text and drawings and all that stuff really

**01:21:13** lives together inside of a note very nicely, which is really good for me is like, you know,

**01:21:18** I'm working on product design stuff, like I have sketches and then I have photos and I have text

**01:21:23** and all that kind of stuff. One thing I really wanted from them was tables. And they've added

**01:21:28** very, very, very basic tables. I want stuff that can do calculations and all that kind of stuff.

**01:21:34** And they're not doing any of that yet. It's very basic, but at least is allowing me to display

**01:21:40** some information in the way I want, which is in a table. But I want them to continue pushing on that

**01:21:46** craft feels great everywhere. Like it's on iOS, it's on the Mac, you know, they use it's a

**01:21:51** catalyst app, but it's one of the best catalyst apps that I've ever used. It just feels good on

**01:21:56** the Mac. And it means that they keep the whole set of apps in lockstep from a feature perspective,

**01:22:02** which is so rare. But that's what the benefit of using this kind of technology is. Obviously,

**01:22:07** I like their widget, right? Like I showed you that I have that widget on my iPad as well. It's just

**01:22:11** like a real easy way to jump into some recently used notes. And as a reminder for people, all of

**01:22:16** my notes for everything else go in Apple's notes. So these are personal notes, show preparation

**01:22:22** notes, you know, like I mentioned earlier, like stuff like trip confirmation emails, PDFs go in

**01:22:28** there, like I have hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of notes that Apple notes have. I think

**01:22:31** it's awesome. And the notes app would do great for all of the stuff that I use craft for too,

**01:22:37** for Cortex brand. But what I've wanted to do with a lot of stuff related to Cortex brand is keep

**01:22:43** things related to our company in their own applications. So they're siloed away. Like it

**01:22:49** is a thing I wished I would have done with all of my relay FM related notes as well. But it's too

**01:22:54** late now. It's too integrated, you know, but like, like it would have been nice for me to have a

**01:22:59** specific app where all of my show preparation lived that was different to where my personal

**01:23:04** notes lived. But it's right now it's kind of like all intertwined. And I don't want to undo it

**01:23:08** because I'm very used to the way the system works. And I've not found anything that works exactly the

**01:23:12** way that I want, which is what notes does, you know, like the way that the share extension works

**01:23:17** and all that kind of stuff. It just it's perfect for me, like for the adding links to it and stuff

**01:23:22** like that. I really like the way it works for that. And I've played around maybe turning it

**01:23:27** into a different craft because craft have like these workspaces. So I could have like two

**01:23:31** workspaces. I might do this in the future, like have a relay FM workspace and a Cortex brand

**01:23:37** workspace. And they lives independently from each other, but inside of the same app, which is an

**01:23:42** interesting way of doing it. Like, and I tried creating folders in notes and putting all the

**01:23:46** Cortex brand stuff in there, but I don't like that. So that's where I'm kind of split across these two

**01:23:52** apps right now. But I do really like how I've got them set up. Yeah. Like I'm always a big fan of

**01:23:58** siloing things if you can in different apps. Like I do think there is a real psychological benefit

**01:24:03** for that. And also I obviously I could understand why Cortex brand is a feels like a very different

**01:24:09** kind of thing from everything else. So it does, it does make sense to have its own, its own place

**01:24:13** to live. The notes app for a while was just a total joke. And then it really seems like Apple woke up

**01:24:20** one day and went, Oh, we should really keep improving this. And even just recently I accidentally

**01:24:25** discovered, Oh, they've added tags now. So if you do like that, if you add a hashtag and put that in,

**01:24:31** like it just shows up in the sidebar. It's like, Oh wow, that's great. They've added another way

**01:24:34** that you can sort through or organize all of your notes. So like the team has just done a really

**01:24:40** good job and just like keep making it a little better. It's one of the best apps. It's one of

**01:24:45** the best apps that Apple makes like without a shadow of a doubt. It's so good and they keep

**01:24:50** making it better. And it's so funny because it was a joke for so many years. It was a joke, you know,

**01:24:55** when it was just like the font was Marker felt, you know, and it looked like a legal pad.

**01:24:59** It was like, it was just a joke, you know, cause like this, the rest of iOS was changing,

**01:25:04** but notes didn't change. And then one year they were like, Oh, we redid it. And now it's

**01:25:08** incredible. And like since then they've only continued to add more features to it. And like,

**01:25:13** you know, people want things from it, but I think some of the stuff that people want are

**01:25:16** like too much. You know, like people want like, what about backlinks? It's like, uh, I don't know,

**01:25:21** man, that might be a bit soon for that. You know, like all the stuff that you get in these apps,

**01:25:25** like notion and craft and Rome and all that where you could tie all the stuff together.

**01:25:29** But I think that it's such a good app, what it does again, especially if you're pairing

**01:25:34** it with an iPad and Apple pencil. Yeah. And even the, like, why I find the handwritten

**01:25:39** notes stuff just so surprisingly useful is like, God damn, is there text recognition for

**01:25:43** handwriting so much better than I would ever expect it to be. Yeah. I am still consistently

**01:25:49** shocked that it does a great job recognizing what words I have written in my super duper sloppy

**01:25:58** cursive handwriting. Like that just, that just seems like a miracle to me that it's able to do

**01:26:03** it. And that's why it's like, boy, it has gotten real good over the years. And that's without even

**01:26:09** talking about quick note, which is not really a feature that I've used very much, but the ability

**01:26:14** to pull up a note from wherever you are in the system and it's integrated in an interesting way

**01:26:19** to grab links and add them to it. And you know, I can see how that's really great for some people,

**01:26:22** but it's, it's not really for, for my use cases. It's so, it's so funny. I kept thinking that I had

**01:26:28** no use for quick notes at all. I was like, there's no, I just have no place for this in my life.

**01:26:33** But I did realize suddenly it's like, Oh, I have one place where this is absolutely perfect

**01:26:39** is when playing magic, I'm designing my own decks. So I'm like picking the cards that I want. And I

**01:26:46** kept realizing like during games, I would constantly think, Oh, I need to have one extra

**01:26:50** copy of this, or I have one too many copies of that. And I, but I would forget by the end of

**01:26:56** the game, what it was that I wanted to change. And then I realized, Oh, this is exactly what

**01:27:00** quick notes is for. Like I don't care to have this exist in my real system. I can just pull it up

**01:27:06** while I'm in the game without having to close it out. And the good thing is that it knows, right?

**01:27:11** So every time you enable quick note, it knows that you're in, I've got the magic app open. So it will

**01:27:16** show you the note that you were working when you last had the magic app open. It's very clever.

**01:27:19** It's really great to be able to just pull that up and swipe up and be like, okay, you know,

**01:27:25** one less swamp, like, and then just at the end of the game, look at what my little notes were

**01:27:29** and make those changes. Even for me where I thought, Oh, I have no use for this feature.

**01:27:33** It's like, Oh, actually though, in the right circumstances, it is very useful calendars.

**01:27:40** I have a bunch of stuff here, which is, I wasn't expecting it. Yeah. I'm, I'm absolutely shocked

**01:27:46** that you have a bunch of stuff in because from my perspective, it's like calendars. Well,

**01:27:50** there's only one answer. Fantastic. Cal is amazing. I agree. What, what more could there be to say

**01:27:55** about calendars? But apparently Mike has a lot to say about calendars. So Fantastic. Cal is the

**01:28:00** calendar app, right? It's excellent. Fantastic on every platform. I love it. One of the things that

**01:28:05** I've really loved that they added this year is if you have a event that has a zoom meeting or

**01:28:13** Webex meeting or whatever attached to it on the Mac, it shows a little icon next to the menu bar

**01:28:18** when that event's coming up and you can just click it and then it will join the meeting. Oh,

**01:28:23** interesting. I didn't know about that one. That's so cool. Like you click the icon and it gives you

**01:28:27** a join meeting button, you press it and it will open that relevant application and join the meeting

**01:28:31** with the information attached to it. So good. Right? Like nice. That is something that we're

**01:28:35** doing all the time. It's a great addition. I mentioned doodle last year. It's an app that

**01:28:40** I'm still using, which is a way to collect. So like you want to make it the meeting and you were

**01:28:44** doing a bunch of people. So like I have frequent calls now on a monthly basis with about eight or

**01:28:50** nine people. This is a way that I can say, here's a bunch of potential times. Vote. And people can

**01:28:57** vote on the time that works best for them. And then we can go ahead and book the meeting.

**01:29:02** An app that does a similar thing, but slightly differently that I've been using is called

**01:29:07** Calendly. It's a service and an application. You give it credentials to your calendar

**01:29:13** and then you can do a couple of different things. Like one of the ways that I've used it is I can

**01:29:18** say, give a time range. So on these days and these days, between this time and this time,

**01:29:24** people can just book meetings into my diary. I can set how long these meetings are by default.

**01:29:32** And I've integrated it with Zoom. So we'll automatically create a Zoom call for that meeting

**01:29:38** when the meeting is arranged. The calendar sync is two way. So if I put something in manually

**01:29:44** during that time, it won't let people book that time. Okay. So this is, this is like a remote

**01:29:50** office hours app. That's what, that's what this is kind of like. Okay. I don't know what that means.

**01:29:56** So like I'm just thinking in college, right? With professors and things like,

**01:30:00** I understand what you're saying now. Yes. I get you now. Yes. I have office hours

**01:30:05** from 3 PM till 6 PM. People use Calendly exactly for that. Like I've been doing it because,

**01:30:11** you know, I mentioned last time and what I'm doing all this stuff for is, uh, I run a podcast

**01:30:16** mentorship group and we've been working on a group project together. So everyone's creating

**01:30:22** an episode of like a show. It's just kind of like as a way to practice skills and we're publishing

**01:30:27** it. Okay. I'll put a link in the show notes to it. If people want to check it out, it's,

**01:30:30** we're working on a subject right now about people making episodes about personal heroes. And it's

**01:30:35** just a way to kind of like, uh, get some practice. And one of the things I wanted to do was I wanted

**01:30:40** to do like a little intro with everybody that's producing an episode. So we'd record a thing for

**01:30:45** a couple of minutes. I asked them a set of standard questions as a way to introduce them to

**01:30:49** the audience. And so to do that, I needed to set up 15 minute calls of eight people.

**01:30:55** And I thought about how horrible it would be to individually arrange those meetings. Yeah.

**01:31:01** That's so I was like, there must be a service out there that can do this for me. And then I found

**01:31:05** Calendly. So I just give it a time range and say, here is the link. Go for it. And then people could

**01:31:13** just, we're just booking it in on their own. And I just really liked that as a system. So I have

**01:31:18** this now and like, you know, I've had some other meetings that I've needed to set up recently.

**01:31:22** And I'm like, Oh, I could use Calendly for that. You know, just as a way to say, here's some time,

**01:31:26** go for it. Fantastic. How has this kind of feature built into it, but it doesn't work in exactly the

**01:31:32** same way. And I've had some friends that have tried to use it and it, and it messed up for them.

**01:31:36** But I really like Calendly for this. And I love the way that it like integrates with zoom and

**01:31:41** stuff. I think that's super clever. And so then like in my zoom account, there's then just a bunch

**01:31:45** of meetings for each one and I can just click start on each of them. So I think it's super cool

**01:31:49** as a service. If this is the kind of thing that you need. Yeah. That's a, that's a pretty sweet

**01:31:54** tool. Like I love stuff like that. Like it's like a scalpel for exactly the problem that you have.

**01:31:59** That sounds like a really great thing to have in the arsenal, which is another one of these is called

**01:32:03** else when, else when, okay. Else when it does two things. One is so discord has this ability to

**01:32:11** give it a like relative time. So it can create this string, this like code string that you can

**01:32:18** paste into a text box that will show individual users a time and date in their own time zone.

**01:32:24** So say you were saying, Hey, I'm going to do a stream and it's going to be at X and that time

**01:32:32** for you, say it's like 12 o'clock in the afternoon in London. But then if someone in America would

**01:32:37** open it and they'd see it in their time zone, right? Okay. These strings are really complicated,

**01:32:42** but else when allows you to select on a calendar, select the time, choose the format and you want,

**01:32:47** do you want it to say the day of the week? Do you want to just say the time? And then you copy the

**01:32:51** code and paste it into discord. And then people look at it and they see it in their own time zone.

**01:32:55** Just really useful for if you are in discord. That's a really specific tool, incredibly specific,

**01:33:01** but helpful for me. The other thing that it does that I use more, which is a feature that I asked

**01:33:06** for, and they very graciously put it in is if I'm streaming, I publish a tweet, like I'm going to be

**01:33:11** streaming on this time. And I like to have a bunch of time zones in the tweet because I wish

**01:33:15** Twitter had this feature that discord have, but they don't have that feature. So I'm going to

**01:33:19** say like, I have like UK three times zones for America and central Europe. Right. And what this

**01:33:26** app does is it allows me to choose a time and then it will, I can copy out a pre-format and thing of

**01:33:31** like each of the flags that I use and the times. And you can choose time zones. You can choose

**01:33:36** whatever time zones you want and it will format them this way. So then if you're sharing something,

**01:33:40** it can be like, it's going to be this time. Here's a bunch of time zones. Wonderful. So else when

**01:33:45** does those two things, does them really well, really easy. That's nice. Scalpel like issue,

**01:33:50** right? Again, like I have these two things that I need and this app just does them. I use it.

**01:33:55** Yeah, that's, that's great. It's like, this is feels else when particularly feels to me like a very

**01:34:01** UNIX terminally application. If like, if this is just a string that does one thing that converts

**01:34:07** some numbers into some other words and that's great. It's just part of the workflow. It's just

**01:34:13** great. It's just part of the workflow. This was also made by the same people who set up a little

**01:34:19** development group in the real AFM members discord who created the widget that I was talking about

**01:34:24** earlier on when we were doing the fundraising. Okay. That makes sense. So it's the same gang

**01:34:29** and they're a really incredibly talented group and they produce things at quite a pace. And so

**01:34:36** because this was an issue we were having in discord of like trying to show things at this time. And,

**01:34:41** oh, by the way that discord has this feature of this time code thing, whatever they call it,

**01:34:46** but it's hard to work out. So they made an app for it. And then I said, Hey, this app would be

**01:34:52** great for this thing that I do. And so they added that into your shaping the world, Mike,

**01:34:57** one app feature request at a time. I guess I'm like an influencer for apps. I don't know.

**01:35:03** Yeah. You're an app influencer. I think that's legit. You put that on your business card,

**01:35:07** app fluencer app fluencer rolls right off the tongue. Very lovely sounding

**01:35:14** time and project management, time management, time tracking. Is this the time tracking section? Yeah.

**01:35:21** I decided to kind of I've messed around with the categories a little bit more and gave us like a

**01:35:25** specific place to talk about time tracking now. And there's a lot to say about time Marie this

**01:35:32** year. The big thing is that it is on the Mac, which is fan freaking, like I am so happy it's

**01:35:40** on the Mac. I was so sad and disappointed when time Marie wasn't available on the first Apple

**01:35:48** Silicon Macs. Cause you could have the iOS version available, but it was because the developer was

**01:35:52** working on a fully fledged Mac app, which I've had the pleasure of also testing out through its time

**01:35:58** period before the Mac had test flights. It was like a whole mess of like manually installing

**01:36:04** these new versions of the app every time. But it is a, it's another app kind of like a talk about

**01:36:09** craft earlier where it's, it's using catalyst technology. So there's like it's part Mac part

**01:36:13** iOS, but feels really good and it's available, but there's two things that I love about it.

**01:36:19** Like you can get all of the stuff that you want. It's just like the iOS app. You've got all the

**01:36:22** functionality that you need right there, but it has one thing, which is very Mac like, which I love,

**01:36:28** which is the menu bar. So in the menu bar, you can set up time Marie currently at the moment.

**01:36:34** It shows me when we're running timer, but you can start and stop timers there. And it also has,

**01:36:39** if you have a bunch of saved timers, you can just activate them right from the menu bar without

**01:36:43** opening the app. And my favorite is recent timers. So I have like basically what's like a week's worth

**01:36:49** of timers right here for me. So I can just go in and I use the same time as frequently.

**01:36:54** So just going in and selecting a recent timer and having it go, like I absolutely love it.

**01:36:59** It's so useful for me and just makes starting and stopping my time is just so simple. It's fantastic.

**01:37:05** Yeah. The menu bar is very cool. I actually don't use it though, because I'm trying to keep

**01:37:11** everything consistent. And so I'm, I'm running time Marie entirely through shortcuts is now

**01:37:18** available because of Monterey. Right. Exactly. Like shortcuts on the Mac is amazing. I'm using

**01:37:24** the shortcuts menu bar for me is very frequently just completely filled with various time tracking

**01:37:31** things. Well, I just want to, I want to put an asterisk on what you said. Shortcuts on the Mac,

**01:37:36** the app is not so great. Having shortcuts on the Mac really great. Yes. I do. I am very aware that

**01:37:44** it's like, Oh, the best place to work with shortcuts should be on the Mac, but I do not work

**01:37:51** with shortcuts on the Mac. I make my shortcuts on my iPad because editing and working with stuff is

**01:37:59** real glitchy. I have 100% faith in that team that they will get this right. Like I'm talking about

**01:38:06** this in a couple of my other shows. They should have called this a beta and I don't know why they

**01:38:09** didn't. And it would have resolved so much of the, the, the, the concern around the quality of the

**01:38:14** application right now. It was a big undertaking. They move again, they moved this to Swift UI.

**01:38:19** Yeah. They moved the whole shortcuts out. They redesigned the whole thing and it needs more work

**01:38:23** on the Mac, but ultimately it doesn't matter to me so much because all I really want is to be able

**01:38:29** to activate my shortcuts, which I can now do. And I love it. Yeah. I don't worry about shortcuts

**01:38:36** being glitchy. I have the same feeling like actually think in the long run, this is very good

**01:38:41** because I suspect that shortcuts is pushing forward Swift UI and then Swift UI can help

**01:38:50** shortcuts be even better. And we're just in, we're just in the early awkward phase where

**01:38:57** shortcuts is a stupidly powerful app. So it is 100% pushing up against all of the limits of what

**01:39:04** Swift UI can do. But also because, uh, again, I'm, I'm still so happy about Apple's stewardship of

**01:39:12** shortcuts. It's like, because they've built it so core into everything they're doing,

**01:39:17** I expect that it's very easy internally for the shortcuts team to be able to point out

**01:39:23** limitations in Swift UI. And then that gets the Swift UI framework improved for everyone. So

**01:39:29** I have confidence that this is the start of a virtuous circle, even if it means right now,

**01:39:34** it's not great to actually edit my shortcuts on the Mac. So I just don't do it. I worse,

**01:39:38** I still work on the iPad when I work on those things. Yeah. And that's fine because the real

**01:39:42** benefit is having access to the power of shortcuts on the Mac. Like that's the great part of it all

**01:39:48** for me. And yeah, the promise of in the future, me being able to automate more of the things that I

**01:39:55** do on my Mac with shortcuts, like as something that I'm dipping my toe into a little bit more

**01:40:00** now, like some of this, the things I do on my Mac, let's just get shortcuts to do them for me

**01:40:04** instead. Like things that are Mac related things. And they added a bunch of shortcut options for

**01:40:10** things that really can only be done on the Mac. So I think that's super cool. Yeah, it's, it's

**01:40:15** really nice. I spent some time converting over all of my shortcuts because there's one feature

**01:40:19** I was really glad that they added was the ability to check what device you're on in shortcuts. Yeah.

**01:40:27** And so a lot of like, I have a basic template now for like, what does a new shortcut look like? And

**01:40:31** one of the, I'm just copying and pasting this across everyone that I use. It's like, check which

**01:40:36** device you're on. And then it runs like an if Mac do this, if phone do this. So I'm really happy to

**01:40:43** be able to universalize a bunch of my shortcuts. So I don't have to make two different shortcuts.

**01:40:50** I can just underneath an if then statement, bury the different options for what I want it to do on

**01:40:54** the Mac or on the phone or on the iPad. Like I'm so glad they added that. And also say running

**01:41:00** shortcuts on the Mac has been very solid for me. Like whenever I run a timer, like it starts the

**01:41:05** timer, the few things that I'm doing, like it works great. It's just working with the app itself

**01:41:10** is totally glitchy. So the way that I am running all of my time tracking stuff right now is I'm

**01:41:17** still though mostly actually running it on the phone and very frequently using Siri to do it by

**01:41:24** just speaking out loud. Cause that is another thing that the focus modes fixed is weirdly like

**01:41:30** Siri would refuse to run shortcuts in the old system when you put on like do not disturb. It

**01:41:34** was very bizarre. Right. As like Siri won't talk to me if I don't want notifications,

**01:41:40** but whatever. Anyway, that's all fixed. But the system that I have for time tracking right now

**01:41:46** is I'm using. Timery and shortcuts in combination with an app I had just started to use last year,

**01:41:54** which is called just timers. And the reason I'm using that app is because it's the timer app that

**01:42:01** has the best integration with shortcuts I have found of anything out there like do, which is a

**01:42:09** great app has surprisingly little that you can actually do in terms of timers and shortcuts.

**01:42:15** Like I check in every once in a while to see like, is the developer added this, but they,

**01:42:19** they just haven't. And so I really like with all of my various timers or my time tracking to be able

**01:42:27** to set a countdown timer of several different lengths to set off just a gentle little alert

**01:42:37** to like check in in a sense of like, Hey, are you still doing this? Or Hey, this might be a good time

**01:42:45** to stop what you're doing right now. Can I ask a question? I can't see if I'm understanding what

**01:42:49** you're doing here. So you have a shortcut that you run that say writing timer and when that

**01:42:55** runs timer restarts running, but then just timers gets activated to be like in 20 minutes. Bug him.

**01:43:02** Yes, that's what's happening. That's a really interesting way to build a system like that.

**01:43:09** I think that's, that's actually really cool. Cause I can imagine it's like as well also reminds

**01:43:15** you to get back on task if you veered off. Yeah. So that's, it's for both uses. So like

**01:43:23** my writing timer, when I flip that, like that starts counting down at an hour and 20 minutes

**01:43:29** and it just like pings me that the timer is up. And I know from long experience, like that is the

**01:43:35** exact right amount of time where I should now just get up and get a coffee, take a few minutes off,

**01:43:41** like, and then start the timer again. That if like I keep sitting there, the marginal value of each

**01:43:47** additional minute goes down real fast. So when the writing session is done, I start another one,

**01:43:52** which just says break. And that starts like a seven minute timer that like pings me at the end

**01:43:58** of the seven minutes to be like, Hey, you should be going back to writing now if you haven't done

**01:44:05** this automatically. But the real killer feature and like why shortcuts integration is very important

**01:44:10** is so like say I've done my writing block, I go and get my coffee and it's only five minutes and

**01:44:17** I go back to the desk and I flip the writing timer again. What has to happen now is like

**01:44:24** all of the running timers need to stop, which would mean that seven minute timer.

**01:44:30** And then also start like countdown from an hour and 20 minutes again, because what you don't want

**01:44:36** to have happen is two minutes into writing, you get a notification that says, Hey, your break is

**01:44:42** up. And it's like, no, no, by starting the writing timer, everything should reset. So I have a lot of

**01:44:49** time tracking timers that need to give that instruction to an app of like reset all running

**01:44:56** timers, start a new timer now. And I have some like funny exceptions to that, like running the

**01:45:02** laundry as a timer of like, Oh, you want to take the laundry out and put it in the dryer. Like

**01:45:07** if this three hour timer is running, don't ever reset that one because that's a different sort of

**01:45:12** time. Right. So like I need to be able to give reasonably complicated instructions to a timer

**01:45:19** app about which timers get reset when, and the only app that I have found up to the job of doing

**01:45:27** that is just timers. And it's also important to me that while I could do this with alarms, alarms

**01:45:34** are way too heavyweight. Like alarms are very interruptive and I don't want that kind of thing.

**01:45:41** Like I just want something very much like we use do for of like a gentle reminder. But if I'm in

**01:45:48** the middle of writing a sentence and like, this is a really great moment, I can totally blow past

**01:45:53** that alert and it's not a problem. Whereas an alarm is like way more interruptive. The only thing

**01:45:59** that I find frustrating is that just timers doesn't synchronize across devices. And so like,

**01:46:06** I can't get it to work on the Mac or like the timers don't synchronize between devices. And

**01:46:14** like that's the final piece that I really want because also like you, a huge amount of my work

**01:46:21** is now just switched back to the Mac. Like the Mac is now the default machine. And I would use

**01:46:28** shortcuts on the Mac more for timers if it wasn't for this particular fact of like the timers don't

**01:46:34** sync between the app in different locations. So I'm still using my phone as the default place

**01:46:41** for time tracking nearly 100% of the time, because that's the place where I can count on.

**01:46:46** My countdown timers are always accurately representing what the current situation is.

**01:46:51** So I love just timers. Like it's, it's great. It does exactly what I want it to do. The only

**01:46:56** thing that kills me is it doesn't sync across devices. So I'm hoping either that can get added

**01:47:01** or like another app can add that as a feature. But like what I need in terms of shortcut support

**01:47:07** for a timer app is reasonably complicated to make this work. But aside from that,

**01:47:14** I'm really happy with the way this works for like time tracking shortcuts, like communicating

**01:47:20** between all of the different parts. And ultimately I also want to tie this in more

**01:47:25** tightly with the focus modes, which I'm not doing right now, but like that's the last piece that I

**01:47:31** feel like will be pretty solid across all of the devices, like doing everything I want every time

**01:47:37** I set a timer running. There was a couple of things that I'm more than I meant to mention

**01:47:42** with timer-y, but I forgot. Okay. One is that they've added reports to the app now,

**01:47:47** which is really great. So there's like a whole reporting section of the application

**01:47:51** where you can go in and see like over a certain time period, the things that you've done, and you

**01:47:56** can set like this year, last year, this month, and you have a lot of options. This is one of like,

**01:48:02** just it's basically for me taking away another reason for me to need to log into the toggle

**01:48:06** website. Like I can see what I've been doing over a set period of time. So I really like that that's

**01:48:11** in the app now as well as just the widgets. Like it's much more broadly functioned in the app.

**01:48:16** And the extra large widget type that's been added to the iPad. Oh yeah, that is great. That's so

**01:48:24** cool. It's really great. Cause what Joe did was just basically take four of the medium widgets and

**01:48:29** just put them in a grid. And it's like, it's so great. Cause it's just like, it's just feels like

**01:48:33** a command center for timing. Like I got everything I need in there. All of my time trackers are running.

**01:48:38** It's awesome. There's also project management as part of this and been using Trello, right? We spoke

**01:48:44** about it last time using Trello over the last year, like me and Adina use it a lot. We use it for like

**01:48:49** managing projects with the studio and with our company here in the UK and like home stuff as well.

**01:48:56** I'm not sure. We're not sure if we're looking for something else. It's starting to like

**01:49:01** get a bit frustrating to use in certain ways. We might be looking for a different tool for this.

**01:49:07** And it's kind of like managing long-term projects with potentially to do's and

**01:49:12** assign them to people. I think we might start looking for a like collaborative to do app

**01:49:21** rather than something like a Kanban. I'm not sure. Yeah. I mean, I said this last time,

**01:49:27** I still always feel this way that like Kanban boards are interesting. Trello seems like it's

**01:49:33** the best in class among these things, but every time I have tried it, I just, I eventually fall

**01:49:38** off it and feel like this isn't really the right solution for what I'm trying to do. This is how

**01:49:43** Adina's failing right now. So I don't know. It's like, it's a weird, I feel like it's just a weird

**01:49:48** intersection of sometimes both too complicated and too simple. Yeah, that's exactly it. Yep. Nailed it.

**01:49:56** That is the issue we are having completely. So we might start looking for something else with,

**01:50:02** we're playing around and we're going to see like what could potentially work better for what we're

**01:50:06** doing, but we're not sure what that's going to be yet. Like at the moment, we don't even really know

**01:50:11** what type of application, right? So it's a bit before we can even start looking at the options,

**01:50:16** but that's in there. Maybe next year I'll have something different to say for this category.

**01:50:21** I mean, don't you want to join the Notion Nation? You can also have Kanban boards

**01:50:25** there. Okay, so this is one of the things I did want to touch on was that you were really going

**01:50:32** big on Notion for Grey Industries last time. Is that still going on? It's not that I have gone

**01:50:39** in big on Notion. It's my assistant has gone in big on Notion. And I guess we can describe that as,

**01:50:46** that is part of the project of managing me is what's actually occurring in Notion is that she

**01:50:53** is managing me in various ways through Notion. And while I still don't love the tool, I'd like,

**01:51:00** there's something about the way navigation occurs in Notion that I just find very odd.

**01:51:06** I cannot pin it down. It's not an app that I would use, but luckily it doesn't really matter because

**01:51:13** it's the app that she is using. And I would give it a big thumbs up. Like it's working really well

**01:51:19** for Grey Industries as a business tool. Like it's very easy for her to lay out a bunch of information

**01:51:27** and ultimately it's very easy for me to look at what has been laid out in various ways. So

**01:51:34** there's a bunch of boring, like internal company stuff that is done through Notion. We do like a

**01:51:39** monthly administration call and that is running through a bunch of projects and like current state

**01:51:47** of things in Notion. And so it's very useful to be able to go through that. There's such a dumb

**01:51:52** little feature of Notion, but I think it's actually quite critical, which is when you are looking at

**01:51:58** something in Notion, it puts a little user icon next to the line that the person is looking at.

**01:52:04** It's kind of like how in Google docs you can see where someone is typing, but it is, it's surprisingly,

**01:52:09** like it's very, very responsive. And more importantly, it doesn't jump around like the little icon will

**01:52:16** slide up to whatever the person is looking at. And I'm just very aware that like when two people

**01:52:22** are looking at a document and talking about a thing, that little user icon is very critical

**01:52:27** sometimes to know like, wait, which part of this are we both talking about? Like just the way that

**01:52:33** it's displayed, I think is fantastic. So we're using it for that. And then we're also using it

**01:52:38** as part of like the fact checking team for going through scripts. Like scripts are broken down into

**01:52:44** a giant table of all facts that are stated in a video. And then we have two people who are

**01:52:50** working through all of those facts. So I would say Notion has been a really big win in terms of

**01:52:57** project management. Like I'm still not doing the actual videos themselves as projects in Notion.

**01:53:05** Like I am still the keeper of the different steps that the project is going through, but Notion is a

**01:53:11** great collaborative database that is very flexible. So again, while I personally don't

**01:53:19** love it, I can still really recommend it as a tool for like anyone who's doing anything

**01:53:24** collaborative with someone else. Like Notion is a great tool to investigate and see if it works for

**01:53:28** you. I will give another recommendation for Kraft because Kraft does most of this stuff.

**01:53:33** You see Kraft as a Notion competitor. Is that the way you would describe it?

**01:53:37** Interesting.

**01:53:37** 100% it is. And what I'll say about what Kraft has that Notion doesn't is a good feeling user

**01:53:44** experience. I think part of the problem that you're seeing with Notion is it's mostly web views.

**01:53:50** And so when you're moving around, it feels like that and Kraft doesn't feel like that.

**01:53:54** I don't think it's as fully featured in some areas as Notion, but I think that they're moving there

**01:53:59** for sure. Like that's the area they're moving towards like further and further.

**01:54:04** So like all the stuff that you're mentioning, like I have a version of those types of things

**01:54:08** in Kraft for Cortex brand, like it's where our admin goes and all that kind of stuff.

**01:54:12** And it has a lot of the features. So I think as time goes on, I believe Kraft will continue to be

**01:54:18** something to keep an eye on for this stuff.

**01:54:21** Does Kraft have a web view?

**01:54:22** Yes, they're building it. It's in beta right now. But it is something that they're working on.

**01:54:28** I have enabled for Cortex brand, I can show you at some point.

**01:54:31** Okay, just in case my assistant is listening right now, do not worry. I have no intention

**01:54:35** of forcing you to move away from Notion. I'm just asking out of curiosity and for the benefits

**01:54:42** and for the benefit of any listeners who are wondering. But it's also important for

**01:54:46** great industries that Notion is cross platform. Like that just has to be a requirement. That's

**01:54:50** why I was wondering about if Kraft has a web view. But I also, don't worry, I have no

**01:54:54** intention of forcing it. Like you can use the tool that you think is best and you think that

**01:54:58** that's Notion. So don't worry. Nothing's going to happen here. I'm just curious.

**01:55:02** Yeah, this is a very focused podcast right now. We're talking to one person.

**01:55:08** Yeah, and I don't even know if she's listening or not. So we might be talking to zero people.

**01:55:12** You know what, Gray? We'll find out.

**01:55:14** Yeah, we will find out.

**01:55:17** This episode of Cortex is brought to you by LinkedIn jobs. These days, small business owners

**01:55:22** are busier than ever. And spending time searching for the right candidates can feel like you're just

**01:55:27** taking time away from growing your business. That's why LinkedIn jobs has made it easier to

**01:55:32** find the people that you want to talk to faster and for free. Hiring is daunting. It's a big

**01:55:40** process. Like you're getting ready to bring somebody into your business. It can take a lot

**01:55:44** to get you to that point. Once you've actually decided that you want to hire someone, you want

**01:55:49** to get that person and you want to find the right person. So you don't want to spend weeks and weeks

**01:55:54** looking for someone because you don't have that time to spend. And then when you do go through

**01:55:59** that process, you don't want to have made the wrong decision because you didn't have the right

**01:56:03** applicants. I have been in this space before. Maybe at some point soon, I'm going to be back

**01:56:08** here again. And I'm going to turn to LinkedIn jobs when I do because they really make it so simple.

**01:56:14** You can create a free job post in minutes on LinkedIn jobs to reach your network and beyond

**01:56:19** to the world's largest professional network of over 770 million people. Focus on candidates

**01:56:26** with just the right skills and experience and use screening questions to get your role

**01:56:31** in front of only the most qualified. Then use the simple tools on LinkedIn jobs to quickly filter

**01:56:36** and prioritize who you'd like to interview and hire. It's why small businesses rate LinkedIn jobs

**01:56:42** number one in delivering quality hires versus the leading competitors. LinkedIn jobs helps you find

**01:56:48** the candidates you want to talk to faster. Did you know every week nearly 40 million job seekers

**01:56:54** visit LinkedIn post your job for free at linkedin.com slash cortex as linkedin.com slash cortex to post

**01:57:02** your job for free. Times of conditions apply. Thanks to LinkedIn jobs for the support of this

**01:57:06** show and relay FM. Communication. Communication. Considering you're not opening your to do app,

**01:57:14** I'm assuming you're not opening your email app. Email. I don't even know what it is. Okay. Here's

**01:57:20** the only thing I will say in this section. I really hope that Apple internally is working on their

**01:57:27** mail app in the same way that they worked on their notes app. I'm still using Apple mail for when I

**01:57:33** do stuff in mail. It's fine, I guess. But boy, does it feel like it hasn't been touched in 10 years.

**01:57:42** And I think there's a lot of great stuff that Apple could do with that. And I just, I hope they

**01:57:47** have some secret notes like project for the default mail app because that thing is okay, but it is old

**01:57:55** and creaky. And just the way that I do email, which is as infrequently as humanly possible,

**01:58:02** I don't have a lot to gain from investigating a bunch of alternatives. So I am just going to stick

**01:58:07** with the default email app and hope it gets updated nicely at some point in the future. But

**01:58:13** quite frankly, even if it doesn't, I don't really care. Like I just don't use it enough for that to

**01:58:19** critically matter. I don't know about you, but for sure Slack has just consumed all of my actual

**01:58:27** important communication and has left email largely like a weird, I don't quite want to say ghost town,

**01:58:36** but the email feels a lot like the real post mail does to me, which is like it's 95% junk I don't

**01:58:44** care about. And 5% terrifyingly critical pieces of information. So I like my dislike of email has

**01:58:52** only increased over time. I want to talk about these two things and just lay out the apps that

**01:59:00** I'm using. And then I want to talk about a wider thing, which is similar to what you were saying.

**01:59:05** So I don't want to touch on it because I want to just lay the groundwork. So for email, I'm using

**01:59:09** three different apps at the moment. So there's a reason. There's a reason. Yeah, yeah, no, no,

**01:59:14** I believe you. Spark is where continues to be where all of my personal email goes and when

**01:59:20** we relay FM email goes, the application is fine. It's okay. It does the job as far as an email app

**01:59:29** on iOS and Mac OS can go. It's about as good as all of them, which I will echo as I always say,

**01:59:35** there is no good email app. They're all varying levels of okay to bad because in my opinion,

**01:59:42** there's only ever been one good email app and doesn't exist anymore. Mailbox, the one that

**01:59:48** went out for mailbox. It's the best email I've ever made. It had a feature that I love that I

**01:59:53** cannot believe nobody has ever copied, which was the ability to manually reorder email in an

**02:00:01** email. Genius. For some reason, nobody else ever wants to make it. And I do not know why.

**02:00:09** Sparks killer feature though, is its collaboration. That's why I use it and love it for that. The

**02:00:16** ability to be able to collaborate with people on email, assign them email, have conversations in

**02:00:20** line that the person you're sending the email to doesn't see all that kind of stuff is so, so good.

**02:00:26** And I'm all in on it and don't imagine anything taking me away from it because that feature is

**02:00:31** so critical to how I work. Yeah. Again, with Cortex brand, I wanted to separate the email out and not

**02:00:39** have it coming with my other email. So I'm using on iOS, just the Gmail app. I don't like it

**02:00:46** particularly, but it's doing the job because most of the email that I'm dealing with is on the Mac

**02:00:51** where I'm using an app, which is difficult to, I don't know how to pronounce this name. I think

**02:00:58** it's Mime stream M-I-M-E S-T-R-E-M. Not greatly named. It is a Gmail app native for the Mac.

**02:01:06** That is truly excellent. As far as email apps go for the Mac, it has every feature done really well,

**02:01:15** tons of options. It is a great app. They are, I believe, working on an iOS version,

**02:01:22** which will make me a very happy man because this is actually a very good email app. It has all of

**02:01:29** the features that you want and tons of customization. And it just looks like the Apple's mail app.

**02:01:35** Really Mime stream is made by someone who used to work at Apple on mail. Oh, interesting. Okay.

**02:01:44** So this person, their name is Neil Givari. And in the about I worked on Apple mail for seven

**02:01:50** and a half years and it shows because this is very fully featured. I have never seen an app

**02:01:58** updated as often as this one, like multiple updates a week with fixes, new features,

**02:02:06** all that kind of stuff. It's great. It's really, really great. I just had to look it up because

**02:02:11** this was ringing a bell in my head because Mime is an acronym that stands for multi-purpose internet

**02:02:19** mail extensions. So it is an internet standard that extends the form of email messages to support

**02:02:25** text in character sets other than ASCII. I wished he would rename it. I don't like the name. It

**02:02:31** doesn't mean anything to me. I think this is like, it means something to nerds who know something

**02:02:37** about email. And it's like, I get it, but I would also suggest a renaming because it's not easy to say.

**02:02:45** I have made the suggestion before I make it for free. I will say it again. Call your app my mail.

**02:02:50** Yeah. I don't know what stream is. I don't know why we're, what are we streaming? There's no stream.

**02:02:58** So anyway, it's a great app. The only, it's the only thing I can complain about is the name.

**02:03:03** They're doing a very good job. Yeah. I was going to say, yeah. The only thing to complain about

**02:03:08** is the name that is like a plus work on an app. And like their product roadmap, you know, they

**02:03:13** have that they're working on an iOS app. Like I just, I like, please, please, you know, please.

**02:03:22** It's great. It's a great Mac app. And that's what I use. It's Gmail only, which would, if they did

**02:03:28** bring out an iOS app, I wouldn't be able to use it for all my email, but I would be able to replace

**02:03:32** the Gmail app. And it just, you know, it doesn't really good job. It integrates with all Gmail

**02:03:36** stuff. So it has like promotions, updates, social folders in it. And it does something that I really

**02:03:43** love, which is a feature I wish to all email apps have. When you send an email, like you're in the

**02:03:47** email list, you send an email, it doesn't open the next email. It just, that's it. You know,

**02:03:53** archive an email doesn't open the next one on market was read. And that, cause that is a feature

**02:03:57** that you can set because this app, like all good email apps has lots of options that you can set

**02:04:05** because email is a very particular thing that people like to do in some ways. So big recommendation

**02:04:10** for Mime stream. That's such a great little detail though. Like I hate that when, when you

**02:04:14** delete something and then it just opens up and marks his red, then it's like, Oh, please, please

**02:04:19** no, don't do that. Like, yeah, those, those little details really matter. And of course there's other

**02:04:24** people out there who would be driven crazy by not opening the next message automatically,

**02:04:27** but that's, that's why you need stuff like that to be an option. So then to continue what we're

**02:04:32** talking about Slack, which is now owned by Salesforce. That doesn't mean anything, but that changed since

**02:04:37** we last spoke about it. Other types of communication discord. So discord we use for members,

**02:04:42** but there's also business related in that for me and air table, which is like a sales database,

**02:04:47** but I kind of consider it as a collaboration communication thing. Here's the overall thing

**02:04:52** that I want to talk about, which is the fragmentation of business communication.

**02:04:57** Yeah. So Slack was, we said this many times, right? Slack's whole thing is,

**02:05:00** Hey, we're replacing email. Here's the thing. You can't do that. Right? Yeah.

**02:05:06** Slack is trying their best to make this happen by like, Hey, now you can integrate with another

**02:05:12** company Slack and you can have these shared channels. It's a great idea, but that's not how

**02:05:17** like, if someone's, if I'm contacting somebody for the first time or they're contacting me for

**02:05:22** the first time, they're not just going to appear in my Slack, right? There has to be an introduction.

**02:05:28** So you can't ever truly get rid of email because Slack just doesn't work that way. And I also really

**02:05:35** don't want Slack to work that way. I don't want people randomly appearing. I actually don't really

**02:05:40** ever want to do the let's join our slacks together thing. I don't like that either. Really is a thing.

**02:05:47** Yeah. So, and the, but the thing is though, what Slack has shown me is that instant messaging,

**02:05:54** I much prefer to email. I liked the tone. I liked that it's quick. I liked that you can have a

**02:05:59** conversation and it's happening in a moment. Right. And then the moment is gone rather than like,

**02:06:05** I email you, maybe you'll email me back today. Maybe it'll be tomorrow. Maybe one is instant.

**02:06:10** And then the next one takes seven days. Like that, like asynchronous communication is so strange.

**02:06:16** When you are so used to now, even more so doing all of your other business,

**02:06:20** your internal business is all done in an instant message and your external business is all done

**02:06:25** with email. And I think that it's such a shame that we have to maintain both of these chains of

**02:06:30** communication type now that there's like internal and external and they're massively different.

**02:06:36** I actually think that while Slack has made this type of communication better,

**02:06:41** it's actually made the problem worse. I'll agree with that. I will agree with that assessment.

**02:06:48** Yeah. So like, if you look at it on a macro scale, internal communication is a million times better

**02:06:54** than it ever was for this type of because of the way that Slack works, but it only makes the

**02:06:59** external stuff feel more jarring. And then you're managing both of these things. And so like,

**02:07:05** there isn't honestly, there is not a way to solve this problem, but I just wanted to talk about it.

**02:07:10** No, I totally get it. And I agree with you. Even just as you were talking, it's like, I almost wish

**02:07:18** like I wouldn't want to use it all the time, but it almost makes me wish like there was an app

**02:07:24** layer above this that I could have something that could kind of bring the Slack and email world

**02:07:31** together. Sometimes when I'm just in the mood to let me just try to clear everything that's in my

**02:07:38** communications queue, and I don't really care where it came from. I could imagine Salesforce

**02:07:44** building this. I mean, maybe. Because Salesforce have email. Yeah, that's true. I'm also just,

**02:07:51** I'm feeling this particularly painfully right now because I have, I have just come back from a

**02:07:57** conference and again, it's like the default mode of, Hey, let's stay in touch or like, ooh, you need

**02:08:07** to send me that thing. The default mode for that is email. And so it's like, Oh, I've got a bunch of

**02:08:13** emails of people that I want to reach out and other people have my email and they may send me

**02:08:19** things randomly. And it's just, I was feeling very aware of, Oh, I need to be, I mean, we can talk

**02:08:26** about this in the themes episode later, but this is, this is a thing of like, okay, the world is

**02:08:34** opening back up. I need to be more on top of external communications for a bunch of reasons

**02:08:42** and just really feeling the dread of like, I just, I find it very frustrating the way

**02:08:47** email is this totally separate world. And it is also impossible to get rid of. And yeah,

**02:08:54** I completely agree with you. It's like you can take Slack out of my cold, dead hands. Like the

**02:09:00** internal business stuff is so much better because of Slack, but the problem is weirdly

**02:09:06** worse on the big picture. It does make email feel more alienating and I'm so resistant to the like

**02:09:14** increasing number of slacks in my little sidebar. And like, so even within Slack communication is,

**02:09:24** is weirdly fragmented. I agree with you. They're just, there isn't a great way to solve this

**02:09:30** problem, but I do kind of find myself thinking, I wish there was just some master cue of here are

**02:09:39** all of the messages that have been sent to you from people. And I don't really care where they

**02:09:44** originated from. I just want to spend an hour trying to blast through as many of these as I can,

**02:09:51** but that is asking a lot from integration from very different tools. So I guess

**02:09:59** communications continues to be a like sad area of the working world.

**02:10:05** So writing and research, we touched on writing earlier. So you have moved from Ulysses to

**02:10:11** Obsidian. Oh, am I allowed to talk about this? Now this is the approved writing structure.

**02:10:18** I don't respect your structures, Mike. We should be able to talk about, actually that's a lie. I

**02:10:23** do because now we're talking about writing and research when you want to. You might say,

**02:10:27** I don't respect your structures, but you are actually the structure. So yes, that's, that's,

**02:10:32** that's what's happening right now. Yeah. So no, I did move away from Ulysses for the reasons that

**02:10:37** I mentioned that the redesign was really frustrating and it eventually just totally killed me.

**02:10:42** And so I have switched over to Obsidian as not just the notes app, but also the complete

**02:10:51** writing environment app. This is a big deal, man. This is a really big deal, I think.

**02:10:56** Yeah, it is. I'm still going to say this, that like, if you are a person who has to do any kind of

**02:11:06** serious writing, I would still probably say that Ulysses is my default recommendation. Like,

**02:11:12** I just always liked this as a problem set of if you don't know anything about a person,

**02:11:16** what is the default recommendation? And I think Ulysses is a good writing app. It's just like the

**02:11:21** changes they made were really bad for me. But I also, this is also one of these cases of,

**02:11:27** I am trying a crazy thing with Obsidian and I think no one should follow me in this direction.

**02:11:33** So I just want to kind of preface this discussion. So I'm going to send you a screenshot of...

**02:11:40** Oh, here we go.

**02:11:43** Here we go.

**02:11:45** Obsidian screenshots.

**02:11:46** Yeah, I'm going to send you a little screenshot of what it looks like.

**02:11:51** Why are you so sad, Mike?

**02:11:52** I'm not sad. Are you going to send me the freaking brain thing? Like the...

**02:11:57** No, I'm not going to send you the brain thing.

**02:11:59** Okay, good. What is that called? What did they call that?

**02:12:01** Oh, they call that the everyone gets distracted by this picture because it looks pretty,

**02:12:07** but it's actually worthless for doing any work view. I think that's the name of what it is.

**02:12:10** This is why I didn't want to see it because it doesn't, it does nothing for me.

**02:12:15** I almost never look at that except every once in a while because it's just pretty,

**02:12:18** but it's totally, I think it is not useful in any. So here's like,

**02:12:23** actually what a useful writing environment looks like. Obviously I've pixelated the script of a

**02:12:28** thing I'm working on.

**02:12:30** Oh, this is so, so helpful for me to understand. Aha, aha. Yes, yes, yes. I can very clearly see.

**02:12:40** It's like, it's like, this is what you would see on an episode of Star Trek. Like this would be the

**02:12:46** screen on the alien ship.

**02:12:48** I think that's fair. I think that's a fair assessment of what this looks like.

**02:12:51** I appreciate that you didn't remove the header tags.

**02:12:55** Oh, well, you know, you need to see where the header tags are. That's perfectly fine.

**02:12:59** Okay. So here is why no one should do what I'm doing, but also demonstrates like,

**02:13:06** what is the weird power of Obsidian? So Obsidian has a million billion features

**02:13:14** and on top of those million billion features, it also has plugins that you can turn on or off

**02:13:20** that make the app behave in different ways. Now, the way I want the app to work when I am, say,

**02:13:30** writing notes on a topic is different than the way I want the app to work when I am writing a

**02:13:38** script. And so I'll just as a quick example, a lot of writing apps have something called typewriter

**02:13:43** mode, where the cursor will stay in the middle of the screen. So as you press the up and down

**02:13:50** arrows, the text moves up and down, but the cursor stays put. And so typewriting mode for

**02:13:56** me when I'm writing a script is like a total deal breaker feature. Like if it doesn't work in

**02:14:00** typewriter mode, like I'm completely uninterested because I want the cursor in the middle so I can

**02:14:06** always see the thing that I have written before the sentence and everything that I have written

**02:14:11** after the sentence. And having my cursor on the bottom of the screen is just like totally

**02:14:18** dumb and useless and also ergonomic. Do you write that way or do you read like edit that way or is

**02:14:24** it both? It's like always? Always. Yeah. So if I'm working on the script, I always want it in typewriter

**02:14:31** mode so that like the arrow keys are moving this river of text up and down, but the cursor is

**02:14:38** staying in the same place because for me, it's really critical. Like this paragraph is extremely

**02:14:45** contingent on what comes before and what comes after. So I always have to be able to say it.

**02:14:50** When you say the same place, what about if you're editing on a line? Do you move backwards and

**02:14:55** forwards on the line? Yeah, you can, sorry, you can move backwards and forwards on a line. You

**02:14:58** can move left and right, but the vertical position of the cursor always stays the same. So yeah. Okay,

**02:15:04** cool. And if you use the mouse and you say like, say you click at some location in a paragraph

**02:15:08** that's above, when you click that will jump down to the center line on the page. So like the

**02:15:16** vertical position of the cursor is unmovable and the text goes up and down. Absolutely critical

**02:15:21** for writing scripts, but that behavior is completely infuriating for a document that may be full of just

**02:15:30** notes and factual information about the thing that you were writing. Like you want to be able

**02:15:35** to scroll that in a different way or position the like, you want to be picky for something that is

**02:15:41** a note for what's on the screen. Because since it's not a continual river of text that's meant to be

**02:15:49** like read in an order, it's just here's a bullet list of like a bunch of facts. You want to be

**02:15:54** able to have that be in an arbitrary position on the screen. So for a note app, typewriter mode

**02:16:00** is a complete deal breaker. It's like that would be infuriating if it was in typewriter mode for

**02:16:05** just this collection of notes that is not a script. So I had this for this situation where I'm like,

**02:16:10** gee, I really like obsidian. I want to try writing my actual scripts in it, but I have these two

**02:16:16** completely incompatible ways in which I work that I would like the app to do both at the same time.

**02:16:23** Right. And so I was thinking about this for a little while and obsidian has this feature that

**02:16:28** they explicitly say, we don't recommend you do this, but you can do this, which is you can open

**02:16:37** up on your Mac two copies of the obsidian app, which are both looking at the same database of

**02:16:47** information. And so I have set up obsidian so that I can run two versions that are looking at the same

**02:16:56** database, but they are accessing a different preference file for how obsidian should work.

**02:17:05** And so I can have this totally crazy situation where there is the writing version of obsidian,

**02:17:12** which is using my favorite black and green color scheme, which I've used for years and years for

**02:17:18** writing scripts. And it works in typewriter mode and it has some features about word count and some

**02:17:24** other little things. So it's like, great, I can have one version of obsidian that's just set up

**02:17:29** the way I want it for scripts. And then behind it, I can have this version that is just set up for all

**02:17:36** of the notes and information that I have about the script that I'm working on. And that one uses like

**02:17:43** this neon 80s theme, which is fantastic. And I can have it set in a very different way to operate.

**02:17:50** This is otherwise known as sync conflict mode.

**02:17:54** No, okay. So it's not sync, like it's not sync conflict.

**02:17:58** I can't understand how you can have two versions of the application open at the same time and

**02:18:03** it not cause problems. It doesn't. Like if anyone wants, I don't recommend anyone does this,

**02:18:10** but if anyone wants to do this, the technical way that it occurs is obsidian uses the phrase vault,

**02:18:16** but they really just mean a folder. So you can have, let me try to phrase this in a sensible way.

**02:18:21** I have my obsidian database. It exists in a folder and that folder has a file in it,

**02:18:28** which is all of the preferences for obsidian. So when I open up obsidian, I pointed at the folder,

**02:18:33** it loads all of the information and it also loads the preference file.

**02:18:38** You can take that folder and put it inside another folder, which contains nothing except

**02:18:46** an additional preference file. And so that's how you can like open two copies at once is it will

**02:18:53** look at the preference file that is in the folder you opened and it will ignore any preference files

**02:18:59** that are in subfolders. So this is the way that it can work. I have tested it very extensively

**02:19:06** that obsidian is constantly reading all of the text files. So if I type in one of the versions

**02:19:13** of obsidian and I have that file open in the other version of obsidian, it changes instantly.

**02:19:21** Like there's, there is absolutely no delay. The app is just constantly live reading all of the text

**02:19:28** in whatever documents that are open. So this is why I can be very confident that there's not

**02:19:34** sync errors happening because I think like it is reading all of that those files constantly when

**02:19:41** they are open. It is not checking in on them every once in a while. It seems like it is a live

**02:19:46** version of that text folder. It does sound like scary sync conflicts are inevitable here,

**02:19:52** but I have had zero problems with this on the Mac. So I would not be using this if I was worried

**02:19:59** about that, but I'm reasonably confident that it isn't actually a problem because of the way that

**02:20:04** it's working. So this is my current janky setup that I don't recommend to other people, but I

**02:20:11** have been really pleased to have something to move to after Ulysses because I was just getting

**02:20:18** increasingly sad about that situation. So what I'll just say is like, this is really awesome.

**02:20:25** Obsidian has a couple of killer features that I really like as well. One of which is there's a

**02:20:31** thing that you can enable, which is called workspaces where you can save an arrangement of

**02:20:37** text documents as like, Oh, I want to switch from this workspace to another workspace. And so what

**02:20:44** is fantastic is if I'm working on two projects at once, I can fussily arrange all of the different

**02:20:51** notes that I have about that project, save it as a workspace, and then like load an older

**02:20:57** workspace and have it remember like, Oh, that this is the way that you wanted all of these things

**02:21:02** arranged the other way. Yeah. I like that. That's cool. It is really great. And so like,

**02:21:07** what I'm able to do with the script is have the script in the center, which is the green and black

**02:21:13** that you're looking at. And then on the side for this project have four or five other little

**02:21:21** windows of like notes about various parts of this open on the screen and accessible. And I don't

**02:21:27** have to reset that up every time. And so one of the things that I'm doing is like, Oh, I can copy

**02:21:33** and paste paragraphs out where it's like, Oh, I think I'm going to delete this paragraph, but I

**02:21:37** just want to put it off on the side for a little while and leave it there. And I want to have it on

**02:21:42** screen if I find another place where this can go. But if I don't, that's fine. Or it's like, Ooh,

**02:21:47** I can make a little narrow column that shows me what is the timeline for when this is going to

**02:21:52** occur. Like that's really fantastic. Obsidian also has lots of options for how you want Markdown to

**02:22:00** work in terms of formatting things. So like you can sort of see it on the little screenshot there,

**02:22:05** but it's like, I can use yellow as like notes to the animator when I first pass over the script

**02:22:10** of like, Oh, this thing is a highlight. And that's just a note to the animator. It's not actually in

**02:22:16** the script. It's really great with the way it works with comments and like, Oh, I can ignore

**02:22:21** comments from the word count so I can like comment out different sections. Oh, that's cool. It is

**02:22:26** super duper flexible. The only thing that it's really missing is like two features. But this is

**02:22:34** where I don't know, Mike, I don't know if this is crazy, but I've started to toy with the idea of

**02:22:39** could I hire someone to work on a plugin to make it do the thing that I want to do. Federico has

**02:22:45** done this exact thing for his iOS review. He hired someone to work on some plugins for him

**02:22:50** and he's done some banana stuff. All right. This is immediately less crazy than I was thinking it

**02:22:54** was. I was expecting you to think that I've gone off the deep end with this. Oh, I do. But so is

**02:23:00** Federico. Both have. So the only two things that are missing and the one that does feel

**02:23:08** kind of critical and it's my only frustration is in apps like Ulysses and apps like Scrivener,

**02:23:14** like lots of professional writing apps, they all have this concept that you're not working with

**02:23:22** one big long text document. You're working with an arbitrarily large number of like little,

**02:23:29** what they call sheets. So you can divide up the script into arbitrary sheets and you can rearrange

**02:23:35** those anytime you want. And like, that's the one thing in Obsidian that it is missing as a,

**02:23:40** like a real professional writing tool. But I think I can get 90% of the benefit. If I could do

**02:23:46** something like I can put like an outline view that shows all of the different headers. It's like,

**02:23:51** if I could rearrange the order of the sections by dragging and dropping the headers in an outline

**02:23:59** view, I feel like that's 95% of what I need from the concept of sheets. And that would be a

**02:24:05** huge deal to be able to just like grab a section at the bottom and move it three sections up. Yeah,

**02:24:11** I know I can do that through cutting and pasting, but it's so annoying to do it that way. And it's

**02:24:16** like, it's way easier just to be able to drag and drop like different sections up and down in a

**02:24:21** script, which is a thing I do constantly about deciding over the thing I talked about early

**02:24:26** should actually happen later. That's probably the number one thing that I would want. But this is

**02:24:32** the interesting thing about Obsidian that makes it different from other apps is like, I don't

**02:24:36** have to in theory, just sit around and pray that the developer adds it. It's like, maybe I could

**02:24:42** just get someone to make it for me. It is very interesting. And if I do end up going down this

**02:24:48** route of trying to get people to make plugins for me that do exactly what I want in Obsidian,

**02:24:55** I could see this app becoming nearly impossible to move away from at some point in the future,

**02:25:01** because it's like, Ooh, if I can get all of the picky stuff exactly the way I want it to be,

**02:25:06** boy, is that that going to be very, very hard to move away from at some point in the future. So

**02:25:12** that is my situation with Obsidian. It's still a crazy complicated app, but I'm really glad that I

**02:25:23** came across it and I don't give app of the year awards, but I would 100% give it to Obsidian

**02:25:29** for slowly taking over almost everything I do that has anything to do with text.

**02:25:35** It's funny how you keep saying that every year that you don't give up at the year awards,

**02:25:39** but now you're giving an app of the year. That's not, that's not the case. That hasn't

**02:25:43** happened before. Fair enough. This episode of cortex is brought to you by Squarespace,

**02:27:37** for their support of Cortex and Relay FM. Lightning round time. Oh, lightning round. Okay,

**02:27:43** let's go. Do you want to start? Yeah, I will start because I was just going to mention one

**02:27:46** little thing, which is to do with research, but I can mention it here instead. I can mention

**02:27:51** reader as part of my lightning round. Oh, okay. Again, completely because of your suggestion of

**02:27:57** moving to RSS and looking for a good RSS reader. Cool. I do also got to say, because basically I

**02:28:01** had the same thing as last year for me with research, which is just, I use the reader app

**02:28:06** and RSS like to get like all of the stories that I need for my shows. I didn't really feel like I

**02:28:11** had new to add. So, but I'm pleased that you're on it too. It's a great app. Yeah, it's a really

**02:28:16** great app. The thing that's also interesting to me is I asked you last year, like, Oh, what did

**02:28:21** you think of its read later features? And it's not something that you use, but reader has now

**02:28:26** displaced what was the oldest app still in use on my phone, which was Instapaper. Evernote has

**02:28:33** left because of Obsidian and Instapaper was now the oldest continually used app on my phone,

**02:28:39** but reader has dethroned it. Like I've stopped using Instapaper and I'm using readers read later

**02:28:44** stuff instead. There are still some things I like better about Instapaper, but readers winning out

**02:28:49** on the convenience front for I can put RSS feeds and read later stuff in one spot. So I'm not quite

**02:28:56** sure anymore what the oldest continually used app on my phone is, but it is no longer Instapaper. And

**02:29:02** I just wanted to say, I really appreciated your recommendation for it. It just got under my skin

**02:29:07** thinking about RSS and I have been very intentionally trying to filter the entirety of my internet

**02:29:15** experience through RSS and it has definitely made my internetting over the last year way better. Like

**02:29:24** I just, I really appreciate being able to do this. And I think I am coming to the conclusion of if I

**02:29:31** cannot get it through RSS, I'm just, it doesn't exist in my world. So I agree with you. Two big

**02:29:36** thumbs up for reader and also two big thumbs up for RSS as well. Like it's a real shame when I come

**02:29:42** across like an interesting blog, but they don't have an RSS feed. I'm like, well, I'm sorry. Like

**02:29:48** you're just not going to get added onto my lists. My first pick is an app called Parcel. I have been

**02:29:54** for a very long time, a big fan of the app deliveries as a parcel tracker available on all

**02:30:00** platforms. There was something though that deliveries was, was like a frustration for me. A

**02:30:05** lot of the services that I would get deliveries for didn't have any information and I'd have to

**02:30:10** go and log in to the website or open the webpage and track it. So like say by Royal Mail or postal

**02:30:16** service, it would, would not show me any status updates. It would just be like, you have to log

**02:30:21** in or you have to click, you have to go to the web to see information about this item. There's a new

**02:30:26** app called Parcel that has vastly better tracking for many of the services that I use. So for example,

**02:30:33** Royal Mail deliveries, it has them, it has all of the tracking information loaded into the application

**02:30:38** itself. It gives me push notifications, but I want them for certain things. It is not as

**02:30:44** visually pleasing as deliveries is, but it has, I think better tracking for basically all of the

**02:30:50** services that I use. Plus it has an Amazon integration where you, in the app, you sign

**02:30:56** in with your Amazon account and it automatically adds all of your Amazon items to the application.

**02:31:02** Ooh, that's killer. It's really good. And if you're using a service and it changes, like just imagine

**02:31:11** you're using USPS and then it becomes a Royal Mail delivery. It recognizes that in the app and asks

**02:31:16** if you want to change to the new tracking. Nice. So good. It's, it's a very, very good app. I've been

**02:31:24** very, very happy with it. Okay. I have a half recommendation, but I do like it. It is a bike

**02:31:30** app. It's called bike citizens. I think it is by far and away the best route finder. If you're going

**02:31:36** to be on a bike and go somewhere else. Oh, I've heard of this. Yeah. It has a lot of nice features.

**02:31:41** Um, primarily, I don't know how they do it. It seems like magic, but they do a fantastic job of

**02:31:48** offering you two or three different options for the route based on, do you want to get there the

**02:31:54** fastest? Do you want to get there the easiest or are you willing to have like a medium one where

**02:32:01** you might, um, make some compromises of like, this is not always the easiest, but it will save you a

**02:32:06** bunch of time over the easy route. Easiest tends to mean safest as well for, for bike driving. Yeah.

**02:32:14** Easiest tends to mean safest. Um, I think they're also taking into account elevation changes,

**02:32:18** but yeah, it's, it's largely like what is the safest route? And I've written around London a

**02:32:24** lot. Like I've gotten to know quite well, a bunch of different routes in the center of the city.

**02:32:28** I'm just amazed at how good of a job, whatever algorithm they're using does at picking

**02:32:35** those three variations on the routes. Like it's, I dunno, it's like shockingly good. It sometimes

**02:32:41** it almost seems like human level intelligence. They have some crazy database of the city

**02:32:46** that includes just tons of little details of, oh, this, you know, this street doesn't technically

**02:32:53** have a connection, but you can just walk over this tiny bit of pavement and you can do that

**02:32:58** because you're on a bike. Like, I don't know how they get some of the data in there that they do.

**02:33:01** The routes algorithm is fantastic. The only reason it's a tepid recommendation is like many apps,

**02:33:09** they did a redesign and I hate the re redesign. They added a bunch of social crap

**02:33:15** and I'm continually frustrated that they don't on the map, like put your location at the bottom

**02:33:22** so that I can see where the route goes for a hundred percent of the phone rather than 50%

**02:33:28** of the phone. Cause like, I don't care what's behind me. I only care what's in front of me.

**02:33:32** So I do find it frustrating sometimes for that, but goddamn, like if you are in a city that bike

**02:33:37** citizens has mapped, it is fantastic. Especially if you are just getting started out on cycling

**02:33:45** and you want some easy routes, they can find the best ones. So this is actually an app that I like,

**02:33:52** I secretly hope that Apple acquires them. Cause I think like this, this needs to get added to

**02:33:57** Apple maps for way better bike route planning. If you ever take screenshots on your Mac,

**02:34:04** you should get clean shot X. Why? So it has way more customization and tools.

**02:34:12** Like if the way that screenshots are dealt with, I love the drag and drop that you can do. It has

**02:34:18** some hover states. So you can just hover over the image and a couple of buttons pop up. One is copy,

**02:34:24** one is delete, and one is edit. So you can put some annotation stuff as tons of annotation tools.

**02:34:32** It does all of the stuff. Like you can do video and make gifts, or you could do images,

**02:34:38** or you can do scrolling images. If you need to catch a webpage, it's fantastic. It's such a

**02:34:44** good application. I really recommend it. It has timers, you know, so you can like set it like a

**02:34:49** timer, like, uh, give me three seconds to get this thing set up, that kind of stuff. So many

**02:34:54** preferences for the way that you deal with things, which I really, really love. You can do stuff.

**02:34:59** Like if you're capturing your desktop, you can have it hide the documents on the desktop. Like

**02:35:06** it's so smart. It does some like really smart stuff, uh, and has tons of really great options.

**02:35:12** You can set keyboard shortcuts for every type of screen capture that it does. You can choose where

**02:35:17** on the screen you want the little preview to be like how Apple does the preview. It does our own

**02:35:21** version of that. You can choose where on the screen you want it to be, how big it is, if it will auto

**02:35:26** close or not. So like apples, it will stay for a little while and disappear with clean shot. You

**02:35:31** just turn that off and you can capture multiple things and they stack. It's fantastic. Trust me

**02:35:37** on this. If you take screenshots on the Mac, you should be using this app. Okay. Okay. I'll give

**02:35:42** it a try. I feel like the Apple screenshot thing is great on its own. So that's why I feel dubious.

**02:35:47** Like how could it be better? But, uh, we'll give that one a try. Okay. I'm going to say if you ever

**02:35:52** have to pick colors that go together well, I'm going to recommend an app called Coolers.

**02:36:00** C O O L O R S. I'm just cool the colors, right? Yeah. Cooler colors. I feel like this is a,

**02:36:08** this is a narrow use case, but it is one of these areas where I am just, this is a weakness for me.

**02:36:13** I am not good at picking several colors that look good together. And I have tried a million like

**02:36:20** color palette tools and I have never loved any of them. Um, but Coolers is fantastic. The thing

**02:36:28** that I really like about it is you can start with a color that you like and kind of lock it in. And

**02:36:36** the app will continue to show you a bunch of random other colors that it thinks will go well

**02:36:42** with the color that you've picked. And as soon as you find another one that you like, you can lock

**02:36:47** that color in and then it will show you a bunch of random colors that match those two. Okay. That's

**02:36:52** cool. It makes it so nice. Like if you have to pick five colors that go well together, this tool is

**02:36:58** just the best. And if you don't know where to start, you can just start with it showing you random

**02:37:04** colors. And until you find color that you like, and again, just like lock it in and build up a bunch

**02:37:08** of other colors that match with it. Trust me, I've tried a million of these things and this is the,

**02:37:13** this is the best one by far. I've immediately sent this to Adina because she's always

**02:37:19** struggling with trying to find complimentary colors for her comics. Yeah. It's, it's surprisingly

**02:37:25** hard. Yeah. Like some people are just great at this, but I'm really bad at it. And so yeah,

**02:37:30** for anyone in the art world, if you're, if you want to match colors, you find the color from

**02:37:34** somewhere and then it's like, Hey, here's some that work with this. Yes. That's really cool. But like

**02:37:40** in particular, like it's the progressive locking in that makes it different. And also I think

**02:37:46** allows you to find unexpected color combos that match. So yeah, I just, I really like it. It's

**02:37:53** just so much better than pre-selecting from a bunch of popular color palettes, which is what most of

**02:37:58** these apps do, or just like you pick one color and then it just gives you, Oh, here's the three that

**02:38:06** match best on the color wheel. It's like, but that's almost never what I actually want. Like,

**02:38:10** yeah, I can pick colors that are all 60 degrees apart on the color wheel too, but like,

**02:38:14** that's not really what I'm looking for when I'm trying to find some colors that go together. So

**02:38:19** I really like it. Bartender, good old bartender app for the Mac that helps you manage the menu

**02:38:25** bar items that sit on the top right hand side of the screen that you hide them, show them,

**02:38:30** let's you create another menu for them. This is especially helpful if you have one of the

**02:38:34** new MacBook pros that has a notch on it, because now it has good support for that. So you can make

**02:38:39** sure that all of your menu bar items are exactly where you want them to be. And you can have more

**02:38:44** of them enabled if you want, but hide the ones that you don't want to see all the time. It's a great

**02:38:48** app. Yeah. This is like required installation on a new computer for me as Bartender. Like boy,

**02:38:54** boy, does that very quickly become necessary to install. Speaking of computers with notches,

**02:39:00** I'm going to recommend an app called Top Notch made by the people who make clean shots. Oh,

**02:39:05** they said, okay, I didn't know that it is a free app top notch and it is marketing really for clean

**02:39:10** shot. Oh, I did not realize that, but yes, Top Notch is great. I do love the new laptops that

**02:39:16** have been gifted to us from heaven. I don't mind the notch, but I just like it to look cleaner

**02:39:22** where Top Notch will just turn the top, whatever it is, you know, three quarters of a centimeter

**02:39:28** black on your wallpaper so that it just gives it a cleaner look. It just puts the menu bar as a pure

**02:39:34** black thing along the top and the notch completely disappears into that. So I think it is fantastic.

**02:39:40** I really like the way that it looks. I haven't tried that one yet, but I think it will just like,

**02:39:44** I have no issue with the notch at all. I think it looks pretty cool, but I can imagine that that

**02:39:47** would also look cool. Like just like an all black menu bar probably looks pretty sweet. Yeah. I like,

**02:39:51** I like it quite a lot. I don't think the notch is annoying. I just like it better looking black. I

**02:39:55** feel like it's very slick across the top like that. Rocket is another Mac app. So Discord and Slack

**02:40:02** have a really great way of finding emoji. You just type colon and then start typing some words and

**02:40:07** it gives you emoji suggestions. Rocket does this for everywhere you input text on a Mac. Hmm. Okay.

**02:40:13** It's fast emoji search universally. That's what it is. Yeah. I think it also does GIF too, but I only

**02:40:19** use it for that, but it basically just allows you to use the same shortcuts that you like, you know,

**02:40:24** text shortcuts, if that makes sense in Slack to bring up emoji that you like. You can just do

**02:40:30** this anywhere that you type text or all. So I use this in messages. I use it, you know, like on

**02:40:36** Twitter and stuff like that. It's really, really great. It's just very simple. It's a nice little

**02:40:40** application. Um, and you can also do gifts and stuff like that if you want to. Nice. I'm going

**02:40:45** to recommend a little plugin for Safari called Pipifier. All this does is it allows you to do

**02:40:53** picture in picture for anything that's playing a video. So while picture in picture works by

**02:40:59** default on lots of places like YouTube, it doesn't work with places like Netflix all the time or

**02:41:04** Amazon prime. And so Pipifier is nice to force some videos to be the picture in picture thing

**02:41:10** that floats in the corner of your Mac. And so I use that a lot on my computer when I'm doing some

**02:41:15** light work. And I also want to be watching a video from some place that doesn't play well with picture

**02:41:19** in picture. My final one is also a Safari extension because Safari extensions also are

**02:41:27** available on iOS and iPad OS now too. And I use this one extension on all of my devices. It's

**02:41:33** called super agent. All it does is automatically fill out website cookie forms for you. Okay.

**02:41:41** Never have to see them. You set the default preferences you want for cookie types and you

**02:41:47** never see them again because super agent just fills them out. Nice. It's so good. Just get rid

**02:41:54** of those things. I never want to see them again and super agent make sure that I don't. Okay. I'm

**02:41:58** going to finish off with just a weird recommendation. I'm going to recommend numbers, which is Apple's

**02:42:04** app that makes spreadsheets. Now, never like here's the reason I'm going to make this pitch.

**02:42:10** Numbers is a spreadsheet app. It is hands down the app that makes the most beautiful spreadsheets.

**02:42:17** They just look really nice. If you're an individual who needs to work with spreadsheets,

**02:42:20** I really suggest that you should use numbers. But I know that for years there has been one thing

**02:42:26** that has held people back from using numbers and they say, yeah, but does it have pivot tables?

**02:42:33** And the answer has always been, no, numbers does not have pivot tables. And they go, well,

**02:42:38** I can't use it, but Apple has just introduced pivot tables to numbers. I have no idea what

**02:42:45** pivot tables are. I just know that this is like a critical feature to lots of people who use

**02:42:50** spreadsheets. So if that's you, you can now consider numbers. And I have used all of the

**02:42:57** spreadsheet apps very intensely. I think numbers really is great. And if pivot tables were holding

**02:43:04** you back, I just want to have the announcement that they are in numbers now. So I'm going to

**02:43:09** recommend numbers as a spreadsheet app. All right. You said that we needed to follow up on a

**02:43:15** flighty stats prediction. So yeah, we do in 2019. We played the game we'd never played before. How,

**02:43:22** how many miles had we flown in that year? And then we made a jokey reference to it in 2020 because

**02:43:29** 2020, right? Right. And we made a bet as to whether we would have in 2021 higher or lower

**02:43:37** air miles flown than in 2020. Right. Now I have a slight problem with this. Okay. What's your

**02:43:43** problem? I'm hoping to take a trip before the end of the year. So I don't have all my miles yet.

**02:43:52** Right. 2021. Right. But you're not a hundred percent sure if you're going to take a trip.

**02:43:55** Well, who can be? Right. No one. So I don't, I mean, I can do it now, but like,

**02:44:01** I would like to push this on a bit and do it later. You would like to push this on and do it later.

**02:44:06** The year's not done. 2021 is not done. 2021 is not done. That is, that is true. I think this is

**02:44:12** funny because I am in almost the exact same situation. So my 2020 number was 11,000 miles.

**02:44:21** My 2021 number is 9,400 miles and 2021. Like I think it is. I don't want to bet. So like,

**02:44:32** if we're trying to collect the bet right now, I have been 100% wrong because I bet it's going

**02:44:36** to be higher in 2021 than 2020. We both bet higher. We both bet higher. This was my don't

**02:44:42** bet against the base rate and kind of like a return to the average, which would have been true

**02:44:47** if like the summer travel had actually started when summer travel was supposed to. I would

**02:44:52** without doubt be above that number now, but it didn't. And that's how bets work is like, no,

**02:44:57** I was wrong. But it is possible that I may just before the end of the year, take another trip,

**02:45:05** which will just edge it out over. So I propose considering we are in 100% control of this bet

**02:45:12** that we just push the bet on maybe to next time and we have evaluated then. I have a conference

**02:45:19** that I might be going to in America, which is at the very beginning of January. And so it's just a

**02:45:24** question of when do I leave in December if I'm going to do this or do I leave in January,

**02:45:30** which also now has the confounding factor of how much do I care about winning the bet because then

**02:45:35** I can go earlier. You just went and bets against ourselves. But I'm just I am very confident at

**02:45:40** this point that my air miles will be high. I don't know if it's going to be higher than 2020

**02:45:45** because I haven't calculated that yet, but I haven't taken all of the trips that I'm planning

**02:45:51** to take. So I'm hopefully going on vacation, which might play into our next episode anyway,

**02:45:58** which is now the now the barrier is really coming down next time on Cortex yearly themes for 2022.

**02:46:09** So get your themes ready. Catch up on old theme episodes. You could also go to theme system.com

**02:46:16** if you want a bit of a refresher as to what a theme is because we have all of that on the website

**02:46:20** because we're going to be talking about them. We're both working on them. So it's nearly that time.

**02:46:24** yearly themes for 2022 next time.
