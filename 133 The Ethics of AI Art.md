# Cortex - 133: The Ethics of AI Art
**00:00:00** So this isn't an actual episode out of time, but it's real close.

**00:00:04** This episode should be released just before the iPhone event, so by the time most people have

**00:00:10** listened to this, but we're doing it now a little earlier than we would normally,

**00:00:15** because I'm going to be traveling and I got a lot going on in September, so we're trying to get

**00:00:22** this done just before. I don't understand how this makes it an episode out of time at all.

**00:00:26** It doesn't. It's close.

**00:00:28** Is it? I don't know. I don't agree. I feel like this is more like, oh, there's just a bunch of

**00:00:32** stuff that's going to happen, but that's not an episode out of time. That's not even an episode

**00:00:36** out of time adjacent. You're always talking about things that are going to happen in the future.

**00:00:40** That doesn't make that an episode out of time.

**00:00:43** I always feel like episodes out of time are made more out of timey based on how

**00:00:47** dated they are due to something we would normally talk about. That's kind of how I imagine it.

**00:00:52** So if we were releasing this episode a week later, it would be an episode out of time,

**00:00:56** because so much would have changed at that point. Things we'd normally talk about like new iPhones,

**00:01:01** new Apple watches, whatever, that I think it would qualify.

**00:01:05** I feel like I'm in crazy town here. Don't episodes out of time, we normally try to pick something

**00:01:10** that isn't time sensitive. That's why it can be an episode out of time. It's like,

**00:01:14** oh, we're going to record this thing and then we'll release it two months from now.

**00:01:17** But then we would never reference that it was an episode out of time. We referenced that there are

**00:01:21** episodes out of time because of the fact that it's obvious that time would have passed because

**00:01:26** there's something that we would have otherwise spoken about or are worried that something could

**00:01:30** have happened that would date the episode in a way that was weird. So we say this is an episode

**00:01:35** out of time. I don't know. That's why we do it. Oh, okay. I feel like I've fallen through some

**00:01:39** kind of time vortex and I have no idea how this works anymore. Cause like if we did a book, right?

**00:01:44** And just did a whole episode about a book, we could record and release that whenever. And that

**00:01:48** wouldn't be an episode out of time because it's just about the book. But if we're doing an

**00:01:52** otherwise normal episode where we just talk about topics, things that we want to discuss,

**00:01:57** if we're, there's like a long time between recording and releasing, then it becomes an

**00:02:02** episode out of time. Because if we leave it for like four weeks, five weeks, which we do sometimes,

**00:02:07** anything could happen that would otherwise date the show. And typically this happens around,

**00:02:13** I think the last couple, if my memory serves has been because there's going to be some kind

**00:02:18** of Apple event or whatever that we would otherwise talk about, but we can't talk about it because it

**00:02:21** hasn't happened yet. Okay. I feel like the only thing that is making this even remotely an episode

**00:02:28** out of time or episode out of time adjacent is this conversation right now. September is a huge

**00:02:36** time for a bunch of reasons. It's busy time work wise. So we've got new iPhones come in,

**00:02:43** iOS comes out, all that kind of stuff. So busy time. But around these parts, it's especially

**00:02:49** busy because we turn our attention to raising money for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital,

**00:02:54** because September is Childhood Cancer Awareness Month for the fourth consecutive year. The relay

**00:03:00** FM community is rallying together again to support the life saving mission of St. Jude Children's

**00:03:05** Research Hospital, which is very simple. Finding cures, saving children. This year, St. Jude is

**00:03:12** actually celebrating its 60th anniversary. Since opening its doors in 1962 St. Jude Children's

**00:03:18** Research Hospital has grown in size and capabilities for one special reason. They believe that children

**00:03:24** all over the world deserve the same chance at survival. Treatments developed at St. Jude

**00:03:28** Children's Research Hospital have helped increase the overall childhood cancer survival rate from

**00:03:34** 20% to more than 80% in the 60 years that it's been around. While these tremendous strides have

**00:03:40** been made, one in five children diagnosed in the US will not survive. And globally, the numbers are

**00:03:46** shockingly reversed with four in five children in some developing countries not surviving of

**00:03:51** childhood cancer. Limited access to high quality affordable medicines and the financial burden of

**00:03:56** research and care are hallmarks of the childhood cancer challenge that many developing countries

**00:04:01** face. And this is how it is across the globe. And this is the kind of stuff that St. Jude is changing.

**00:04:07** St. Jude is a hospital in Memphis. It has a very important link to us here at Relay FM. You know,

**00:04:14** if you're not aware and you wonder why do they raise money for St. Jude Children's Research

**00:04:18** Hospital every year, my co-founder Stephen Hackett lives in Memphis, was lucky to live in Memphis as

**00:04:23** his eldest son was diagnosed with a brain tumor when he was very, very young. And St. Jude took

**00:04:33** him as a patient, saved his life. And he is now a incredible young man who I love dearly

**00:04:45** and wouldn't have been around without St. Jude's help. So that is our personal connection to this

**00:04:51** place. But the more time we have spent and learned about St. Jude, the more time I have had to

**00:04:57** interact with doctors and patients and families just show how special a place this is. It is a

**00:05:05** very unique institution in America because of the way that they work in that families do not pay for

**00:05:09** the treatment. And St. Jude also provides food and housing for patient families so they can focus on

**00:05:17** the health of their child. But St. Jude was also a research institution and they share what they

**00:05:23** learn with the world. For example, recently in 2021 they did some medical trials that saw a

**00:05:30** 20-point improvement in survival rates for high-risk neuroblastoma, which is the second most common

**00:05:35** solid tumor in children. They produced this antibody at the campus in St. Jude and have

**00:05:41** then since shared this knowledge with the world. So we turn our attention to raising money for St. Jude

**00:05:49** for a bunch of reasons, primarily because they want to save the lives of children everywhere.

**00:05:57** Childhood Cancer Awareness Month is an opportunity for us to come together in the fight against

**00:06:01** childhood cancer because together we can make a big impact. And this year you're able to support

**00:06:06** the Relay FM for St. Jude campaign in multiple ways. So as always we invite you to make a donation.

**00:06:12** Donors who make an individual gift of $60 or more will receive a digital bundle,

**00:06:17** including a wallpaper and a macOS screensaver pack, which is just for people that donate.

**00:06:21** If you donate $100 or more you get this plus some special stickers that we're just giving to people

**00:06:27** as a thank you for donating. If your employer offers a matching gift program, so if you donate

**00:06:33** check with your employer if they do matching gifts. If they do there's a form at st Jude.org.

**00:06:37** That can be credited to our campaign. If you work for a big company it's very likely that they do

**00:06:43** charity matching. Ask. And new this year if you want to get more hands-on you can now start your

**00:06:49** own fundraising campaign to help us reach our goals while also earning exclusive Relay FM merchandise.

**00:06:55** If you sign up to fundraise and you raise one dollar or more you'll get an exclusive

**00:06:59** St. Jude limited edition of a Relay FM challenge coin. If you raise $250 or more you will get a

**00:07:05** very weird and unique desk mat which features the cartoon heads of me and Stephen. It's very strange

**00:07:11** but it's great. If you may have seen last year that I covered my desk in stickers of Stephen's

**00:07:17** face we are now allowing you to do that on a temporary basis because you will unlike me you

**00:07:22** will be able to remove the desk mat and put it back whenever you want. It is like something out

**00:07:28** of a nightmare but it's also kind of amazing. Yeah so you've seen my office right you've seen

**00:07:33** no desk. This year I'm doing the big one. Oh you're doing the big one okay so that one's going to get

**00:07:38** completely covered. More Stephen stickers. So basically we do this for every couple of

**00:07:42** hundred dollars raised. We each put a sticker on some piece of furniture in our offices. So my

**00:07:48** recording desk is completely covered and now it's going to be spreading to another but if you want

**00:07:52** to do it sign up to be a fundraiser raise $250 or more and you'll get a desk mat so you can take it

**00:07:57** off when you don't want it. Now the fundraising thing is really cool. What it does is it enables

**00:08:03** you to be able to extend this message yourself to your friends, your family, your co-workers

**00:08:09** and help us raise more money. This is money that our campaign would never see otherwise because

**00:08:13** maybe these people don't listen to our shows and also if you don't have the money to donate yourself

**00:08:20** this is also a way to get involved. So you're able to say go to family, friends and say

**00:08:25** here's this thing it's an amazing institution. Would you like to donate some money? Go to

**00:08:30** stdude.org slash relay. You can donate and find out more about fundraising. So that's what's going

**00:08:35** on there. I want to talk about the podcastathon. So this will be the fourth podcastathon which is

**00:08:42** an eight hour event that we do. It's a variety show, features many relay FM hosts, special guests,

**00:08:49** me and Stephen hosted together. This year it's going to be on September 16th from 12 to 8 p.m.

**00:08:55** US Eastern time. Now the plan is we'll be back in person. Wow. Okay. So the first one we did in

**00:09:03** person then we had to do two remote. So me here in mega studio, Stephen at st Jude.

**00:09:11** We really wanted to do it last year but we just couldn't make it work. It was very unfortunate

**00:09:15** with like travel restrictions because the travel restrictions ended in like October. So we kind of

**00:09:21** just missed out on it. Yeah. It was a heartbreakingly close call last year. I remember that. That was

**00:09:27** awful. It was rough. It was rough. But this year that the plan is that I'll be back in Memphis and

**00:09:33** we're going to do it live together. I'm terrified because of my last big trip to America. So I have

**00:09:41** like real kind of COVID anxiety right now. We have tried to plan for all of the potential contingencies

**00:09:49** but really we're planning for one thing which is doing it in person and if it doesn't work,

**00:09:56** we'll just fall back. But it's kind of like there's no point. I think going deep on all

**00:10:01** the contingency plans because there's so many variables for like what if I get COVID or what

**00:10:08** if Stephen gets COVID or what if somebody in our families layover in Austin. You're going to record

**00:10:13** from there. You never know. We are doing layover. Chicago the way there, Dallas the way back,

**00:10:18** another 90-minute layover on the way back. So I think we'll be spending our third night in Dallas.

**00:10:23** Okay. Right. I just I see no other potential here. We will be in Dallas for the third time

**00:10:28** this year. I'm saying it right now. I'll report back on this later but I am convinced that we

**00:10:33** will be in Dallas again. It's just I see no other way. But it's kind of one of those things where

**00:10:39** we had a conversation as a group because we work with a wonderful team of people at St. Jude

**00:10:44** who help us plan these events and we're like okay well we'll just see what happens because

**00:10:50** I think it's too complicated to try and specifically plan out every contingency.

**00:10:55** It's just like high level this is what we'll do but we're all just like headstrong on we're going

**00:11:00** to be together. We're going to bring in a bunch of our favorite elements of the past three events

**00:11:04** especially the last two because I've done things and Stephen's done things but we've not been able

**00:11:10** to do those things together. So like last year he had this big challenge wheel that he would spin

**00:11:16** and it would land on certain things we'd have to do them. I've never got to spin the wheel

**00:11:21** and we're also we're constructing a balloon room. A balloon room yeah I was gonna ask like it better

**00:11:26** be a balloon room. So that I'm actually really excited it's gonna be leveled up in a in a fun

**00:11:32** way. So I will still have my balloon room but Stephen will be able to experience the balloon

**00:11:37** room which I think he's actually very scared of. I think he doesn't like the idea of the being like

**00:11:41** surrounded by balloons. It always would freak him out when I would dive in them. So we'll see what

**00:11:46** that would be like. It's kind of gonna be like a greatest hits of the last four years which I'm

**00:11:51** very excited about. It actually also might be the day that iPhones come out. It's some little thing.

**00:11:57** Yeah it is it is absolutely insane how much work the two of you put into this podcast-a-thon

**00:12:03** every year and yeah getting there in person to do it together this year like I'm so glad that

**00:12:10** that's going to work out. Again it was just it was so heartbreaking last time that that you had to

**00:12:14** do it remotely. So I'm very happy about that. I'll be curious to see Stephen's apparent fear of

**00:12:20** balloons explored and that can always be a nice motivator for people to donate. This man is afraid

**00:12:25** of balloons donate and we add a balloon right like that's just classic. Oh it's like how I always

**00:12:30** have to eat those disgusting jelly beans. Give more money and Mike eats the like jelly beans

**00:12:36** that are flavored like dish water and rotten eggs. Yeah it's like great I'll just I'll keep eating.

**00:12:41** If there's a one fundraising crowd pleaser it's making someone uncomfortable in some way that

**00:12:46** goes along with it right. People just love it for the fundraisers. I hate the thought of it but at

**00:12:52** the same time it donates money for childhood cancer so I'm like all right I'll do it then I

**00:12:56** suppose you know like I'll suffer this. Yeah people like people suffering for a cause so that's

**00:13:03** that's what that is yeah. They've got so much happening September we're doing a bunch of extra

**00:13:08** streams for the first time this year we're going to be doing a campaign closing stream at the end

**00:13:12** of September where we announce the final total and all that kind of stuff. We've got a bunch of

**00:13:17** milestone streams that we're unlocking with different really FM hosts and we're playing

**00:13:20** video games and that kind of stuff. All of this is over at stu.org slash relay so please go and

**00:13:26** check it out go to stu.org slash relay you can learn more you can donate you can sign up to

**00:13:31** fundraise and let's cure childhood cancer together. This episode of Cortex is brought to you by

**00:15:46** Do you use git now? Oh no I made a terrible mistake. You've ruined our subreddit.

**00:15:54** You've ruined it. I didn't ruin it I just I didn't know what I was asking.

**00:15:57** Okay so listeners who don't go to the subreddit previously on Cortex. Gray was discussing his

**00:16:07** syncing problems with Obsidian and Mike was bullying him in an entirely correct way and

**00:16:14** so we had this big conversation about like how to have a workflow in my writing program

**00:16:20** that syncs between me and my assistant that can be used for making changes on pdfs and a whole

**00:16:27** bunch of stuff. Anyway the fundamental question is hey I would like a text document that synchronizes

**00:16:34** between me and my assistant and there are reasons why it is difficult to do in my writing app of

**00:16:41** choice Obsidian. And so on the subreddit of course very helpful people were proposing suggestions

**00:16:50** and one of them was git and git is one of these things of like I've heard about git

**00:16:56** I've heard programmer friends talk about this thing for you you know you like you push and you pull

**00:17:02** on the git there's like a tree and the tree merges. There's a hub. Is there a hub? I don't know. I

**00:17:12** think there's forks and pulls and requests. Yeah there's like stuff I don't know it's just one of

**00:17:19** these things like you're aware you can't have programmer friends without being vaguely aware

**00:17:23** of like oh git is a thing that programmers use and it's like programmers don't be angry it's

**00:17:30** like a way to collaborate for programmers on source code I guess. Yeah what it does as far as

**00:17:36** I'm aware. Yeah as far as I'm aware too but Mike on the internet you never know right. Come on

**00:17:42** who could be mad about that? I also like Federico. I'm from Federico who writes wonderful ios reviews

**00:17:48** every year. I know that he started using git as a version control system and a way to share

**00:17:57** his reviews with proofreaders and stuff like that. I know that you started doing that multiple years ago.

**00:18:04** It's like a backup system and like a checking in system like similarly to how programmers use it

**00:18:10** of like this part's done do you want to look at it and it's you know it's got version control and

**00:18:16** history and all that kind of stuff so it ends up being a I think pretty decent tool that people

**00:18:22** use for collaboration of things other than coding just because of the way that it works

**00:18:28** from like a fundamental level. Yeah it was one of those moments where someone suggested they said

**00:18:32** hey have you looked into git and I said oh I would like to know more and boy did I get more.

**00:18:38** Um like and I want to be clear people were very helpful but it also became very clear very fast

**00:18:45** like okay I think this is one of those tools where if you are a programmer who is already familiar

**00:18:52** with this it is a great tool that is totally useful in a lot of circumstances but if you're

**00:18:59** not already familiar with this this is like oh god here's another layer of thing that can go wrong

**00:19:06** and if I'm just using it in this one scenario it just it struck me as dangerous overkill for the

**00:19:13** current situation. Yeah it seems like a big learning curve yeah I think like if you're coming

**00:19:18** in cold we use github for the management of our software development projects every layer of

**00:19:25** them like we run our own systems we maintain our own publishing systems and add platform system

**00:19:30** and that kind of stuff so I have to use github every now and then right which uses git but it's

**00:19:36** its own tool right it's git fundamentally but then it has its own stuff on top and like I can see how

**00:19:42** good it is but oh boy does it confuse me when I'm in there. Oh so you're actually you're actually

**00:19:47** hands-on pushing and pulling and I don't do the pushing and the pulling and the forking and the

**00:19:52** and the I use issues which is just like a bug tracking request system I do no forking or

**00:19:59** hubbing or anything like that but I see that it happens I see that the push is merged and

**00:20:06** you know all that kind of stuff. The push is merged and you know all that kind of stuff.

**00:20:13** Yeah and then the other parts happen everything we said and that's the one you take.

**00:20:20** Yeah so I want to thank everybody who was trying to convince me to use git I think it's overkill

**00:20:25** it's also one of those situations where I can we talked about this with Dropbox for me and

**00:20:31** it was like you were discussing like google notes as well there's an additional layer which is

**00:20:35** always when it has to be a tool not just for you but a tool when you're working with multiple people

**00:20:40** and it was one of these things of like I might be able to use git but selling this as a hey here's

**00:20:48** what we're going to do between the two of us with me and my assistant I was like this is completely

**00:20:53** out of the question there is no way this is going to be the right tool for the two of us.

**00:20:57** I saw somebody ask on twitter would iCloud file sharing not work for this?

**00:21:02** Okay so here's the current state of affairs someone else mentioned that on the reddit

**00:21:08** and is one of these interesting moments because I realized that I had gotten something into my head

**00:21:15** that wasn't true you know sometimes when you've used systems for a long time you can have this

**00:21:20** idea of oh I know the way things work because I know how a tool that I've used for years works

**00:21:26** and you don't realize oh it's actually changed since then and so you have artificial restrictions

**00:21:31** in your brain so in iCloud Drive there are these I don't even know what to call them if Apple has

**00:21:38** a specific name for them but there are like these folders that your applications use which is sort

**00:21:44** of different from oh you just have a folder and often they're putting like oh these are files that

**00:21:51** are not really meant for the user to access it's like a bunch of stuff that the app just keeps for

**00:21:55** itself. Well some some apps keep all of your projects in there though. Yeah yeah but like

**00:22:00** sometimes the apps are just using it for themselves sometimes it's oh hey you can actually put files

**00:22:05** in this and so this exists at the root level of iCloud Drive and in my head precisely because of

**00:22:11** my long experience with Apple and the way iCloud Drive used to work I always filed those in my head

**00:22:19** as like oh these are like library folders they're not really here for the user you just interact

**00:22:25** with them entirely through the app and I have a separate folder which is acting like basically

**00:22:31** Dropbox where it's like Grey's iCloud stuff and this just has a bunch of folders in there

**00:22:36** and I had artificially in my head it's like Grey's iCloud stuff keep out top secret yeah exactly

**00:22:43** no boys allowed you know yeah it was gross I think was the sign but good old Calvin and Hobbs but

**00:22:54** so anyway like I just I had divided in my head this totally artificial line which I realized

**00:22:59** through the conversation on Reddit so again it was very helpful to everybody who was leaving comments

**00:23:04** I was like wait a minute I think I can just dig into this obsidian iCloud folder where I'm sinking

**00:23:10** stuff and can I just share a single subfolder of this with my assistant and it turns out yes I can

**00:23:19** so I can I can go into there and just share a folder with her now we've currently run into one

**00:23:26** more technical problem which I was literally checking in as we were putting the show notes

**00:23:32** together this morning I'm like what's the current status of us trying to figure this out so the

**00:23:35** current limitation that we don't know if it's technical or not is my assistant will be doing

**00:23:42** this work on a Windows machine why the sharp intake of breath there I would not trust that at all

**00:23:51** okay so here's the fun we've been having because I literally haven't had my hands touch a Windows

**00:23:58** computer in greater than a decade like the last time I used a Windows computer I was working as a

**00:24:04** teacher and so we were going through a bunch of steps but I figured out oh Apple makes in a

**00:24:10** program that they call iCloud for Windows which and now this is this is where we get into it I'm

**00:24:17** trying to help my assistant with like technical support on her Windows machine upon which I know

**00:24:24** nothing so it feels like I'm a blind person like reaching into the void and being like oh maybe

**00:24:29** this this box goes over there I don't have any idea she sent me screenshots and like it was so

**00:24:35** funny to get a screenshot of just like oh here's what I'm looking at and like I know what nothing

**00:24:39** on the screen is I don't even know if I'm looking at a file browser like what is this I have no idea

**00:24:44** so she is able to access the files on her Windows computer but what we haven't been able to figure

**00:24:51** out is there doesn't seem any way for her to edit them in place like she has to make a copy

**00:24:57** she can edit the copy then delete the original and rename the copy the same as the original

**00:25:04** don't like that at all I know right so I'm not exactly sure what the current state of this

**00:25:14** project is but it does turn out yes in theory you can share subfolders of any iCloud folder even

**00:25:23** those weird app ones which I just didn't think was the case with another user even if they're on

**00:25:29** Windows so my question is no look I'm not trying to make anyone change platform right

**00:25:35** how impossible would it be for your assistant to do this work on iPad so we have also been

**00:25:40** exploring iPad as an option I think that that's the way to go I would say you right now do not

**00:25:46** trust the Windows tool no you don't trust it I just don't okay so iCloud file sharing has been

**00:25:53** a problem on the Mac in the past right like he has suffered from unreliability which is like this is

**00:26:00** one of those things for me do you remember for a really long time nobody trusted photo syncing

**00:26:06** but none of us trusted photos syncing but over time we learned to trust it

**00:26:10** I feel this way about iCloud file sharing because even things like shared iCloud folders took over

**00:26:19** a year to be like it was supposed to be in a version of iOS and just never showed up

**00:26:24** and I think it's like just recently started to actually work so like I'm not even convinced

**00:26:29** that this is a something that had enough long term user testing on what if I use it for something

**00:26:36** mission critical though yeah surely is not an issue that way right so I wouldn't trust this

**00:26:48** with the Windows tool because I don't know man

**00:26:53** so like this was I'm just looking it up now right this was supposed to come out with Mac OS Catalina

**00:27:01** and it got delayed on the Mac for a long time like file sharing a folder sharing I don't know

**00:27:06** if you're doing folder sharing or file sharing here it's folder sharing it has to be folder

**00:27:10** sharing this is a relatively new thing I wouldn't feel comfortable my biggest issue is that if she

**00:27:18** is actually unable to just edit in place that's I just can't I just can only imagine that's going

**00:27:27** to cause some kind of problem yeah yeah like some kind of syncing issue with obsidian like obsidian

**00:27:32** is going to be looking for a file that doesn't exist I also do have that flagged in my head

**00:27:36** is like okay this is workable but this also feels like the exact kind of thing that can confuse

**00:27:42** syncing very easily you're going to get some kind of conflict somewhere yeah someone made a copy

**00:27:47** edited the copy deleted the original renamed the original to be the copy like that feels great if

**00:27:53** everyone's computer is online at the same time while it's happening but that feels like it could

**00:27:59** be real bad if someone's computer is offline and wakes up with a different version yes file and

**00:28:04** then it's like wait what happens here I have in the past noticed that iCloud Drive syncs

**00:28:12** not as quickly as Dropbox yeah iCloud Drive I feel very much the same way as you wherein

**00:28:17** when it first came out I just didn't trust it at all for me as an individual user I think it's

**00:28:24** basically rock solid now like I haven't had any problems with it yeah I use it for not I still

**00:28:28** use Dropbox but like I use I don't worry about using iCloud Drive for my own stuff anymore like

**00:28:35** if an app uses it or whatever like I use it as like okay like I'll have some stuff in here

**00:28:40** that's totally fine yeah exactly yeah I'm perfectly fine with it as well but it does still have this

**00:28:45** thing of iCloud Drive is never in a rush to synchronize anything I don't know it always feels

**00:28:51** like iCloud Drive just spends a lot of time in a cafe sipping tea looking out the window like

**00:28:58** reading the newspaper and like it'll it'll do its job but maybe not right now you know it'll do it

**00:29:03** when it's convenient and that's fine if I can tell it sync now like I can with Dropbox yes exactly

**00:29:12** you can't you have no control of iCloud Drive it will just get to it when it's ready like if I

**00:29:17** think something stuck with Dropbox I can pause and unpause it and it will start going or I can

**00:29:22** look in the little Dropbox app and it will show me what's syncing yes iCloud Drive has none of this

**00:29:28** sometimes there's a little spinner right or like a little progress bar but that's what you get and

**00:29:33** like uh what's particularly delightful right now is of course we're recording this I'm on the

**00:29:38** writing computer which is used for podcasting as well naturally and whenever we do that I have a

**00:29:44** little shortcut that I run that turns off Dropbox for four hours and then it will turn Dropbox back

**00:29:48** on after we're done recording because you don't want Dropbox spinning and eating up all the the

**00:29:52** internet while that's happening some people don't have a problem with this my Dropbox is currently

**00:29:57** uploading this conversation yes I know Mike we're all very impressed with Superfast interconnection

**00:30:06** yeah that's fantastic for you we had a conversation beforehand where Greg was telling me about his

**00:30:12** internet was which is why I am now snappable yes so it is vital for all podcasters to minimize

**00:30:19** everything that's using the internet while you're doing something that's going to be real time for

**00:30:24** for some for all podcasters but so in this conversation of course while we're discussing

**00:30:29** iCloud Drive I opened up my iCloud Drive folder just to look at the obsidian thing and even right

**00:30:34** now on the bottom there's a little message which says iCloud Drive is currently downloading 15 items

**00:30:41** five gigabytes out of 12 gigabytes and it's like what are you doing iCloud Drive I have no idea

**00:30:49** what that could even possibly be and it's like it's extra funny to me because we're recording

**00:30:54** the show I have just come back from a two-day trip where I didn't bring any devices other than

**00:31:02** my phone like I didn't really take any pictures this is the first time I'm using any of the

**00:31:06** computers also all the computers have been on the entire time I was gone and it's like hey

**00:31:14** this is what gives iCloud Drive that feeling of like oh it's got other stuff to do and oh

**00:31:18** iCloud Drive I guess was on vacation over the past couple of days and right now while we're

**00:31:24** recording a podcast it's decided to download 10 items like 11.35 gigabytes worth of stuff like

**00:31:31** right now it's gonna download I don't have any problem with it because it does work it syncs

**00:31:35** everything is there but there is a little bit of like what you doing buddy where were you what 12

**00:31:41** gigabytes of stuff do you have to sync when I literally haven't touched any of my devices

**00:31:47** other than my phone for the past two days it's so weird well I mean maybe it's downloading a

**00:31:53** bunch of files from someone's windows pc that have been accidentally added in yeah I mean but that's

**00:31:58** also where I'd love to see what it's actually downloading so I could go like oh it's downloading

**00:32:02** you know system 32 folder like okay well then at least I can debug that and I can have some

**00:32:06** idea of what's going on so I don't really know quite where we are in this technical project I

**00:32:13** do think the next step is to try to figure out if there is a way to do it on the iPad I wasn't

**00:32:19** quite sure how to debug that but it does just occur to me I can try to do this as a test with

**00:32:24** my wife's iPad so I can actually just have a device in front of me that isn't mine and see okay can

**00:32:30** I make it work on my wife's iPad and then I have a prayer of doing tech support over the phone of

**00:32:35** how to get this to work for somebody else my recommendation is if you're going to go down this

**00:32:40** route if it does work you should keep it to Apple platforms yeah that would be ideal yes

**00:32:47** one if there's an issue you can't debug it but two it's just you know if it's going to be supported

**00:32:52** well anywhere this is the best place like I guarantee you no matter how many people are

**00:32:58** working on it and I'm sure there are really smart people working on it it's just not going to get

**00:33:02** the resources for the Windows software that you're going to get for iPad OS for the syncing of

**00:33:09** documents right oh yeah for sure for sure that's just that's just naturally the way I would expect

**00:33:13** it to be like of course Apple has to make it absolutely rock solid and like making you work

**00:33:16** on Windows is great but it it just can't ever be priority number one it just it would be insane if

**00:33:22** it was that way you just you just couldn't possibly but I mean especially because the open

**00:33:25** in place thing is just what's freaking me out like yes no there's also that's a like it's a

**00:33:31** long time power user that's a real red flag for like yeah I don't like this at all because that

**00:33:36** was a time when that was just what iCloud Drive did like you could not open files in place with

**00:33:44** iCloud Drive like and it was one of the things I didn't like about it like every time I opened it

**00:33:48** on another machine it would make a duplicate and it's just like this isn't what I want or like if

**00:33:53** an app wanted to use something in another app's folder there was just no way to access those

**00:34:00** documents right you would have to copy them but now you don't need to do any of that because

**00:34:05** those app folders are now just treated as folders inside of the whole thing that you're able to

**00:34:09** freely access so it works fine but if it's still doing that kind of stuff on Windows I'll be a bit

**00:34:16** like oh I don't know yeah I don't think it's going to work great but I will say if you can get this

**00:34:21** to work better it will be better for you than Git I'm almost convinced of that Git is is not an

**00:34:26** option you know I now know way more about Git than I ever did before and I still feel like oh no

**00:34:31** this is this is this is just too much but yes I do want to thank everyone for technical support

**00:34:36** I want to anti-thank Mike for bringing this up at the end of the show because it really has gotten

**00:34:41** under my skin of I would like to have a system that is much better for doing hand annotations

**00:34:48** on the script I really do feel like that's a critical part of my workflow that is just

**00:34:53** is not where it should be I don't know why I'm getting anti-thanked then you're getting

**00:34:57** anti-thanked because I had brushed this to the corner of my mind and I just was mostly able to

**00:35:02** not think about it I'm just here trying to make your work better you know just I know anti-thanked

**00:35:07** for it it's super annoying like I didn't have a problem before and now I have a problem right

**00:35:12** so the script process may have been slightly suboptimal but I was able to deal with it

**00:35:17** and now I feel like oh great I have this really annoying technical problem to try to solve with

**00:35:21** a bunch of tools that might not want to work well together to make this happen so I actually think

**00:35:26** that what you just said then just a pretty good summary of our show and working life together

**00:35:32** in general oh yeah I didn't have a problem now I have a problem I feel like that sums everything

**00:37:50** speaking of problems i think apple's gonna help me out how's apple gonna help you out this might

**00:37:56** be the best thing apple has done for me personally ever oh yeah okay they have announced that i think

**00:38:03** starting next year they are no longer going to require people to put email addresses in rss feeds

**00:38:11** for podcasts oh wow okay i was like what on earth could this be all right so i spoke about

**00:38:18** this when i was complaining when i had like a real just like breakdown about email a while ago on the

**00:38:24** show because i was just fed up with the amount of absolute i get in my email inbox every day and

**00:38:31** i know where it's coming from it's like people getting my email address or relay FM email

**00:38:36** addresses from podcast rss feeds and they just get added to mailing distribution lists

**00:38:42** and i get spam endless spam about hey do you want this cryptocurrency expert on your podcast

**00:38:48** right like that's just what i get all day every day and now apple is saying no longer will we be

**00:38:56** requiring this uh because they've now like you know in the intervening time apple now has a

**00:39:03** whole system for submitting podcasts to apple podcasts called podcast connect which is like

**00:39:09** basically it's based i think on what the app store connect thing is where you like submit stuff and

**00:39:14** it gets reviewed and then you can view statistics and all that kind of stuff about your shows

**00:39:19** they've now made it that like basically that's what they care about is you have an account on

**00:39:23** podcast connect and you can have multiple users and all that kind of stuff and so that's just kind

**00:39:29** of how a contact email address for apple is given and that no longer needs to be confirmed

**00:39:36** in the rss feed i will be intrigued to see i haven't actually into this like how are they getting

**00:39:41** ownership claim of feeds because i think that was part of it right that like the and this is

**00:39:48** something that a lot of platforms have used and it's going to be interesting to see how this

**00:39:51** changes they're like you submit an rss feed and then to a to a platform the platform looks for

**00:39:58** the email address in the feed then contacts that email address with a code which you then validate

**00:40:04** i was like i own this feed so i haven't actually looked into that i'm sure that they've but like

**00:40:09** just like a thought that popped into my mind right now but whatever i'm sure there's a system but

**00:40:13** the reason this is good for me is we will now be able to remove email addresses hopefully from our

**00:40:19** rss feeds which will stop some of the crap email that i get because i'm sure i'm already on a bunch

**00:40:27** of lists so i know i'm going to get it forever but there will be a selection of new lists that

**00:40:33** my email address won't be on which i'm excited about yeah you can kind of stop the future spread

**00:40:40** of this is the main thing like eventually i might be able to weed out a lot of the spam right and

**00:40:46** it's just not not new spam that's coming and there'll still be some but it'll be less like in overtime

**00:40:52** i kind of get rid of it get rid of it so i'm excited about that yeah i'm happy to hear about

**00:40:57** that as well i was going to talk about this either on state of the apps or in the theme

**00:41:01** episode but i might as well mention here just like so people can truly understand the scale of this

**00:41:05** issue of like oh when you have to have your email address in a publicly accessible database like

**00:41:12** this with apple i made a real push over the past few months to try to clear up my email and try to

**00:41:18** get back on top of the system for a bunch of reasons and in the past three months i made a

**00:41:24** note when i started so that i could see where this went i have deleted over 100,000 emails

**00:41:32** and it's like a huge portion of that is obviously coming from the fact that like oh my email address

**00:41:38** has been in this public area and is is like accessible and you just get like mike said

**00:41:45** so many weird offers and just yeah like this whole level of emails where they're directed at you but

**00:41:53** they're not personal to you it's just monstrous to try to deal with to actually find the useful

**00:41:59** emails under this enormous dump of things and it's part of the reason why like i think when people

**00:42:05** hear like oh i just have largely ignored my email for huge amounts of time people are like how can

**00:42:10** you do that it's like well it's just because the like the signal to noise ratio is so awful the

**00:42:16** majority of that wasn't straight up spam like my little like how many messages do you think have

**00:42:22** thing doesn't track the spam messages that's like the stuff that is deleted it's all this

**00:42:27** weird semi-spam stuff that that comes through through this kind of thing so i'm very happy

**00:42:32** to hear about that too so yes i would like to get my email out of those lists if remotely possible

**00:42:37** this is one of those things that talking about the software we will be able to make that change

**00:42:41** really fm shows because we control our feeds but then it's up to other podcast platforms and

**00:42:47** systems to also decide that they want to make that change oh yeah yeah right but hopefully they

**00:42:53** will and uh it will make things easier for a lot of people while we're talking about big companies

**00:42:59** and podcasting initiatives some time ago we spoke about the idea of youtube getting into podcasting

**00:43:07** it's like a thing that we were just wondering like what is this sleeping giant going to do

**00:43:13** and i don't know if they've actually done anything but there's been a bit of a hubbub

**00:43:19** in the podcasting community about the fact that youtube now has a dedicated page which is youtube.com

**00:43:26** slash podcasts and if you're in america currently ah yeah if you're in the usa it shows you a page

**00:43:34** where they have curated a bunch of podcasts and made some playlists for them i used a vpn and

**00:43:41** took a screenshot of this page at some point which i've put in the notes for you and i'll put

**00:43:47** in the notes for other people it's not really much of anything right now okay it's like here are a

**00:43:54** bunch of popular podcast creators and here are a bunch of playlists of different types and there

**00:44:04** you go and so like they're kind of curating podcasts which i'm not really sure why they feel

**00:44:11** the need to do this what seems manual curation kind of seems antithetical to what youtube is

**00:44:18** but it definitely feels like there is manual curation going on here because i have not found

**00:44:24** unless you have a way to tell youtube hey we're a podcast right so so okay so here's what i wonder

**00:44:33** about this um yeah so so when we talked about it last time i am i'm really big on like oh if i was

**00:44:40** in charge of youtube i think podcasts is a big growth area for them actually i think there's

**00:44:46** a lot that they can do here i genuinely really want youtube to get into the podcasting area

**00:44:51** like both as a producer and also as a listener because i think they can really help solve the

**00:44:56** discovery problem which is part of what podcasts are the worst at now like i don't i don't know if

**00:45:03** i agree with you okay why don't you agree with me because people are already doing it youtube

**00:45:08** don't need to to have a hand in this at all what do you mean people are already putting video versions

**00:45:13** of their podcasts or like people are already treating like here's a bunch of people in a room

**00:45:18** we have microphones we have cameras this is now a podcast and it's on youtube right right yeah

**00:45:23** yeah this is already happening and the youtube algorithm is serving this content to people

**00:45:29** youtube does not need to have a podcasting initiative of any kind for this to happen on its

**00:45:34** own so like i would prefer them to do nothing because my concern is if they try and turn their

**00:45:42** hand to this it's going to upset a bunch of stuff what are you worried about getting upset it's

**00:45:47** another big platform saying they do podcasts when it's okay i'm getting a bit tired of the debate of

**00:45:55** like a podcast is only a podcast if it's in an rss feed i've said this a bunch of times i feel

**00:45:59** like now it's just that's stupid that's too many times right it's just like whatever but a youtube

**00:46:05** video is not a podcast it just isn't like if i can't get it in a podcast app it's not a podcast

**00:46:15** it's just here is a long youtube video and my concern is like spotify youtube will be encouraging

**00:46:23** people to just publish their stuff on their platform that's the part that bugs me right

**00:46:29** the rss thing whatever but a podcast should be available wherever you get your podcasts

**00:46:35** that's my kind of conceit on it like the particulars about exactly how i don't care about but i do

**00:46:41** believe that this is a type of content which is best served when people can get it wherever they

**00:46:46** want to get it now that could mean that like you do what we do we have a podcast we also publish

**00:46:52** on youtube right that i'm cool with and if youtube stays out of this space this keeps happening

**00:46:59** right people maybe make it their youtube video and then they release the audio right my concern is

**00:47:05** if youtube keeps pushing in they're gonna go no no no no no don't do that part here's 20 million

**00:47:11** dollars just keep it on our platform okay so you're worried they're going to provide financial

**00:47:17** incentive to be because i was trying to think like well why wouldn't someone just also publish it as

**00:47:21** an rss video they're gonna do what spotify is doing hmm because like my point is like i think

**00:47:27** people say like you're you're saying people should stop making one argument but it's the same argument

**00:47:31** i don't think that it's the same thing like because we participate in what are considered

**00:47:36** closed platforms like you can get all of our podcasts on spotify but that's because we're

**00:47:42** not entering any particular deal with them they're just another destination for us to publish our

**00:47:46** shows right but if spotify said to us like if you want to put your stuff here we're the only place

**00:47:53** that you can publish it be like no i don't want to do that because now we're not participating in

**00:47:58** the new open ecosystem and so if youtube just continue doing what they're doing right now

**00:48:03** people can choose to do whatever they want right they can put their video version on youtube

**00:48:08** they can put their audio maybe their video on spotify they can put their audio wherever they

**00:48:13** want right it can go into apple podcasts it can go into every single other third party podcast app

**00:48:19** my concern is if they're like hey we have a podcasting initiative hey uh logan paul here's 50

**00:48:26** million dollars now you just publish your podcast with us right you know what and and that's the

**00:48:32** thing i don't want to happen and i would worry would happen if youtube continues pushing into

**00:48:39** this arena right okay i guess i guess i think that is fair because i have run across a couple

**00:48:44** of channels that even call what they're doing a podcast and then i discover there is literally no

**00:48:49** place to watch it other than youtube and that's not a podcast to me right now it's just a youtube

**00:48:54** show which is great like go for it if you're not on apple podcast and spotify like you're not doing

**00:49:00** it right it's not a podcast anymore but you know what's particularly weird about that is i found a

**00:49:06** couple of examples that are just audio only too they're not even doing the uh oh we have cameras

**00:49:12** and we have that fancy whatever road microphone or the sure smb or whatever the heck it is

**00:49:18** they're not even doing that it is just it's like what we do with cortex it is just audio only

**00:49:23** and then i've gone to search for adding it to overcast and it's like oh there's no RSS feed

**00:49:28** at all that i always think is very interesting like what are you guys doing yeah why are you

**00:49:32** just publishing the audio to youtube um it seems very strange to me so okay i think that's that

**00:49:38** that is a fair fear i think i think you're not wrong there i guess i just i feel like youtube is

**00:49:45** less bad because it i don't know maybe it's wrong it just it just feels much better than something

**00:49:51** like a spotify sounds like starkholm syndrome to me what i was just trying to think here is like

**00:49:56** can i actually come up with an actual reason why and nothing is is leaping into my head youtube

**00:50:02** just works for you yeah right so like to you youtube's fine because you use it understand it

**00:50:08** yes and you benefit from it you understand how to be successful with it in a way that

**00:50:14** i think a lot of people don't and so to me youtube is really nerve-wracking because i've built an

**00:50:22** audience however i've built it whatever the way is i don't know how it's happened but it's

**00:50:26** happened over time right i don't think i would have been able to do that the same way with youtube

**00:50:35** deciding what shown to people like we talk about this a lot right the subscriber and the algorithm

**00:50:42** and i think that my content and the shows that i make have succeeded based on the fact that people

**00:50:47** made a choice and then they kept tuning in because there was a new episode in their list

**00:50:53** and i feel like if it was youtube i don't think that would happen and also one of the things i

**00:50:59** love about podcasting is the barrier to entry is low you just need a microphone and zoom or skype

**00:51:06** or whatever right and you can go for it with youtube that barrier to entry is so much higher

**00:51:14** yeah because as soon as you put video into it to get something that looks professional so much

**00:51:20** more time so much more effort than to get a podcast that sounds professional you really don't

**00:51:25** have to do a lot to get a podcast that sounds good with youtube it's now a whole different kettle of

**00:51:31** fish because i dug through this page as far as i could see every podcast that is featured has a

**00:51:37** video component it's not like what we do so one of the reasons why i think this this has struck me

**00:51:43** as an interesting project that i wonder if youtube is getting into is that youtube does have a feature

**00:51:49** which i don't i don't think it's accessible to all channels like i think we can't do it on cortex

**00:51:55** i think i remember looking for it once it may just be in beta but they have a way as a creator

**00:52:01** where you can it's they don't say like mark as podcast but i feel like this is functioning what

**00:52:07** they're doing they're asking if the video that you have uploaded is it is like an audio only

**00:52:14** experience or if it is something that is a listenable experience i forget exactly what

**00:52:19** what their language is but what they're asking for there and i've seen it on the youtube app for

**00:52:24** for stuff that is basically like listening to a thing youtube will change the interface to act

**00:52:30** like audio controls like them youtube music they show the youtube music controls which is like big

**00:52:34** play pause and skip yes yes and so that's the thing that has has seemed to me interesting and

**00:52:40** like i wonder looking at this page i don't think they want to do that you don't think that's what

**00:52:44** they're up to no i think they want people to make video podcasts i don't think they want audio

**00:52:50** podcasts but see mike i want them to want audio but i don't think that they did i think that

**00:52:57** youtube know video and so they just want video and just poking around this page it's a very

**00:53:05** strange page it seemed incredibly clear to me because look i'm not trying to be that guy there

**00:53:10** was shows that had significantly smaller audiences than even we do on youtube that were

**00:53:17** included in this and they were included in it i believe because they make video shows and we don't

**00:53:23** right okay so i don't want podcasting to become a video medium as a consumer i watch lots of

**00:53:34** podcasts on youtube but i don't want that to be the only way that this content is created

**00:53:41** because i think it would stop a lot of great shows from being made hmm when i heard this

**00:53:46** announcement i was looking around to try to see this podcast page and what it was and i couldn't

**00:53:50** find it and so now obviously that's why it's only in the u.s can't see it over here and so i just

**00:53:55** have this screenshot of yours to go by and it is a strange selection of things the one that

**00:54:01** particularly strikes me is the one at the very top which is the nightly news broadcast from like

**00:54:07** clearly a tv channel and that's but like yeah is that a podcast no it's no i think that's that's

**00:54:13** a news program that you could listen to so maybe maybe you're right in the long run maybe this

**00:54:18** isn't like the thing that i would be thinking of if i was in charge of youtube podcasts this is

**00:54:24** more like a watch time initiative how can we min max content that is really long but also still

**00:54:31** has a visual component and highlight those as things for people to watch i don't know hmm

**00:54:38** yeah i have to say that the more i look at this screenshot the less i like i like it

**00:54:45** so i'm not convinced that this would be a good thing i like that we're able to take our

**00:54:52** podcast to whatever platform we want and make them available to whoever wants to get them

**00:54:57** and my worry is another big platform coming in and locking that content down because i genuinely

**00:55:05** think that's bad for everybody it's bad for the creators even though they make a bunch of money

**00:55:10** not all of them do yeah yeah it's it's bad for the creators collectively yes and it can be very good

**00:55:15** for individual creators like especially yeah individual creators whatever they've just made

**00:55:19** their money like make your money right and i don't begrudge creators that do that individually

**00:55:26** but what i don't like is when there are like companies that decide they're going to do this

**00:55:31** exclusive arrangement and now there are a bunch of podcasters who their next move is now hampered

**00:55:37** like if you're a person who works for a podcast company that podcast company decides they're going

**00:55:43** to put all their content on spotify you're now kind of stuck with the amount of people that can be

**00:55:49** listened to on spotify which is growing all the time i will say recently you know i've been

**00:55:56** tracking kind of our show it's like 15 of our audience now listen to the show on spotify

**00:56:01** i'm genuinely shocked by the number i cannot believe it's that big i would have guessed like

**00:56:06** three percent i feel like would have been my first first pass at that no it's approaching and in some

**00:56:11** cases passes what we do on youtube now and so like i don't have a problem with that as like a creator

**00:56:17** because it's like we choose to be there but if we were only on spotify well now we've potentially

**00:56:24** taken 85 of our audience away right right right and so these are the things that concern me for

**00:56:30** some people that work in the industry of like well now if you work for a large publisher they've

**00:56:35** decided to go all in on one platform if you want to now go and start something on your own one day

**00:56:40** you've restricted the amount of people that could possibly know about you for you to now go make that

**00:56:44** move you know so little things like that bother me and so i don't want another big company to do

**00:56:50** to do this and the problem i have is youtube is i think the company that could have the biggest

**00:56:59** negative impact because of their size and scale and you think that negative impact would be directly

**00:57:05** through exclusives yeah they have a lot of money and could write a lot of checks if they wanted to

**00:57:13** they don't even need to pay you cash or just change your rev share yeah that is true say

**00:57:18** like we can make you a ton of money over time if you just publish here so stuff like that it's just

**00:57:22** like i don't i don't like the thought of that really hmm well you made me less happy about

**00:57:31** this project than i was previously it's like mike but i i would like to discover new podcasts and i

**00:57:39** think youtube could be really good at that so do i that's my only interest like oh but it also

**00:57:44** is like counter to what you like youtube doesn't want to recommend a channel to you

**00:57:49** yeah it wants to recommend one video so is it really going to help that is that is also a good

**00:57:54** point even the very top here is like popular episodes and again we can get into this like

**00:58:00** platonic question of what is a podcast but having individual popular episodes feels like

**00:58:08** that does not fit the platonic ideal of when the podcasts are it's like if i you know youtube will

**00:58:15** recommend an episode of a podcast to me now because there's some kind of drama surrounding it

**00:58:19** and then i might go oh lovely and i watch 20 minutes of that podcast and that's the end of

**00:58:26** anything useful for anybody like i have not decided i want to subscribe to that podcast

**00:58:32** people got a big breakout hit now they think their podcast successful but it's not changed

**00:58:38** yeah and a lot and a lot of podcasts like the very experience depends so much on the fact that

**00:58:44** you have already listened to other episodes or like you know the hosts yeah that also feels

**00:58:49** like a fundamental thing of like what are podcasts as opposed to videos is like oh i make a video and

**00:58:55** it is about a topic and the topic is the primary focus of the video like a video is about a thing

**00:59:02** there are podcasts that are like that but there are far fewer of them than how you yeah yeah

**00:59:06** channels work but this is why like i'm just trying to think about general characteristics

**00:59:12** and like oh what makes a general characteristic of a podcast and one of those general characteristics

**00:59:18** is i am interested in the host's take on this thing because i have heard the host talk about

**00:59:26** lots of other things yeah it's like i am curious about the opinion of this person who i have some

**00:59:33** sense of who they are through long experience which is at the absolute opposite end of the

**00:59:39** spectrum of this is a video about a thing and you don't need any previous experience with the thing

**00:59:44** because you're watching a video about the thing you don't need to know anything about the person

**00:59:48** who's talking about it it's just this is the topic and typical youtube partners i guess like

**00:59:53** podcasts are kind of more like vlogs in that way like yeah vlog channels you have to like just start

**01:00:01** understand that you're not going to get a lot of context for a while until you've maybe gone back

**01:00:05** and watch more videos to get more context about this person and why are they doing these things

**01:00:10** right now that's kind of like podcasting right like you could jump into an episode you could

**01:00:15** pick it up and start listening and you'll get there eventually but it might help the fact if

**01:00:20** you go back and listen to more of it maybe all of it maybe just a big chunk of it it helps right

**01:00:25** but like that's one of the great things about podcasts i think is like once you find a new one

**01:00:29** oh there's so much stuff to go and listen to if you enjoy it but it makes it harder to just jump

**01:00:35** in than like your typical youtube video about runway numbers or whatever like if you if there

**01:00:40** was like a six part podcast series about runway numbers that included follow-up from the previous

**01:00:45** one it's like not as easy to jump into right yeah so i don't know if the medium ultimately is really

**01:00:53** that good for youtube to like really push on i was like this is where podcasts should be

**01:00:58** and then recommend them to people of like hey here's a popular episode you're just like so

**01:01:05** like i never see like if i get because i get recommended all kinds of stuff right

**01:01:09** like everybody and i'm sure i get recommended hey here's a two-hour podcast from these people you

**01:01:15** don't know like why why would i listen to that but sometimes it's like here's a creator you're

**01:01:22** already following and this is their podcast channel and they're now talking about this thing

**01:01:26** are you interested and some people go yeah which is what which is honestly like the main reason

**01:01:33** the cortex youtube channel exists right because sometimes we talk about things in your videos and

**01:01:38** then people get suggested them and they're like oh i'd like to know more about that and then they

**01:01:42** go and listen to the cortex episode about whatever video but i don't know if like that video just

**01:01:50** works cold to someone yeah it's it's interesting you're also just pointing out something that

**01:01:56** for my own like quote podcast listening on youtube that is also true i've actually realized like oh

**01:02:03** my behavior actually expresses interest in the guest and total lack of interest in the hosts

**01:02:10** right so youtube will recommend me stuff like oh you're interested in person x they've appeared

**01:02:15** on this show where they're talking to them and i guess i never really thought about it but my

**01:02:20** experience is almost entirely like i don't care at all about the people who are talking to the person

**01:02:25** in fact most of the time is like they're an obstacle to hearing like the person that i

**01:02:30** want to hear discuss something and yeah i've never ever subscribed to any of those kinds of things

**01:02:38** just like oh youtube is recommending videos where a guest is making the rounds on podcast

**01:02:43** shows or whatever it's like oh i want to hear the guest talk about the things but that absolutely

**01:02:46** never helps those channels at least from my perspective to subscribe because i never have

**01:02:52** and i never i never really thought about that yeah but i guess from youtube's perspective

**01:02:58** that fits into what they would be thinking of with this very top line here of like popular episodes

**01:03:05** it's is going to be very again more on the video side of it more like the content side not the

**01:03:12** long experience with the hosts side so then does it push podcasts to be like you'll never guess what

**01:03:20** that's where i'm kind of going with this is because even when you mentioned uh like oh it's

**01:03:25** more like vlogs on youtube i feel like the golden age of vlogging has totally passed and it's it's

**01:03:31** partly because vlogs slowly mutated into this same kind of format of oh you can't really count on

**01:03:41** people just to show up each week to see what a person's up to even if that person is quite

**01:03:45** interesting vlogs kind of mutated more in the direction of stunts and yeah and it's like i'm

**01:03:55** actually trying to think and just excess yeah excess excess is a really good way to put it

**01:04:02** excess of everything excess of everything and excess of energy from the person who the vlog

**01:04:10** is about and excess in like just horrific lifestyles like an excess in what they're up to

**01:04:19** you know we're skydiving out of an airplane onto another airplane today it's like yeah that's what

**01:04:23** everybody does for their weekend so yeah i guess because i and i think youtube just totally caused

**01:04:28** that with people realizing again because the subscribers are not really yours you cannot hold

**01:04:34** on to a regular audience even if those people are interested in your vlog like they just won't see

**01:04:38** that it exists and it pushed all of them into more mr beast end of the spectrum uh and so yeah i

**01:04:46** guess i guess inevitable what i should have realized at the very start of this is that youtube if it

**01:04:52** gets into podcasts will push podcasts into being more like the most viral of youtube videos which

**01:05:00** is not really at all what i want to get out of a podcast and so now i'm sad this episode of cortex

**01:05:06** is brought to you by wealthfront there's so much going on with the economy right now are we in a

**01:06:23** FM how much of this ai art stuff going around have you seen hmm interesting yeah i mean you okay

**01:06:32** so you you know what i'm talking about yes yeah i know what darley is there's a bunch of them

**01:06:37** darley i think started this right into popular culture yeah and then a bunch of other things

**01:06:44** came about i don't know whether they're connected or whatever like i know that ai art exists i know

**01:06:51** that the way you generate it is by just giving a string of text to one of these ai programs

**01:06:59** and it will spit something out for you like i've seen youtube videos about it i've you know i have

**01:07:03** friends that have participated in soon some searches i have honestly don't care for me

**01:07:13** right like i know that if people are like this is fun i'm gonna see what comes out when i put this

**01:07:18** text in like for me i have zero interest in it right now and i have like negative interest in

**01:07:29** it for some stuff that probably we're going to touch on if we're going to talk about this

**01:07:33** oh negative interest yeah wait negative thoughts or negative interest as in it's below boring

**01:07:40** it's wait it's like i think it's interesting right like i don't think this is boring i think

**01:07:44** that this is a really fascinating technology thing i don't think it's a good thing i think

**01:07:54** it's a bad thing okay and let me explain for the listeners if they're not familiar with this because

**01:07:59** is it one of these i've been kind of asking people about this and it's very interesting to see the

**01:08:04** varied response where some people are very like omg i can't believe what's happening about this

**01:08:10** and other people are like i've never heard of this before right right right the first thing

**01:08:14** where it really came across my radar is i don't i don't know if you've seen that there's a twitter

**01:08:20** thread here which is the first example that caught my attention of ai generated art and it's from

**01:08:26** this program called dolly yeah and yes the idea with dolly is you give the computer a sentence

**01:08:34** and it tries to generate dolly in particular is like generating artwork but it's generating an

**01:08:40** image to match the sentence dolly is apparently the best of these like there's a bunch around

**01:08:46** dolly seems to be the one that is the most advanced and it's also closed like not everyone

**01:08:53** can use it but people get invitations and then like a limited amount of like questions that they

**01:08:58** can give it i think yeah so a lot of this stuff is incredibly computationally intensive so it's

**01:09:04** like it is very expensive to run you cannot run it very well on just normal computers you need

**01:09:09** like these amazon style clusters of machines to actually do this stuff but so this this particular

**01:09:16** thread caught my attention because this thread is incredible someone came up with an idea of hey i'm

**01:09:21** going to try to ask dolly to make images of kermit the frog in various style movies you need a prompt

**01:09:30** this is the sentence so the prompt is a still of kermit the frog in blade runner 2049 and so then

**01:09:38** you get an image which is supposed to match that and i have to say it looks exactly like you would

**01:09:44** imagine a still of kermit the frog in blade runner would look like it's it's photo realistic it

**01:09:50** captures the style of that futurism and what makes this thread really great is they continue onward

**01:09:58** and so it goes a still of kermit the frog in the matrix and so here's what kermit would look like

**01:10:04** if he was in the matrix the one that really caught my attention was a still of kermit the frog

**01:10:10** in spirited away it just looks like it's in the movie yeah it's unbelievable the spirited away

**01:10:18** one was the most shocking because a miyazaki has a real distinctive art style and it just absolutely

**01:10:29** nails it of oh this is how this is how kermit the frog would look like if he was in a miyazaki movie

**01:10:34** right but here's the problem right how well let's let's get to that later right we'll get to the how

**01:10:40** later right okay but like don't think about it too hard i just i just think the the thing to establish

**01:10:47** here is that it is possible and if you if you're listening to the show and you have never heard of

**01:10:53** this stuff before like go look at this link in the description to see it looks much better than

**01:11:00** however you're imagining it would be yeah it's legit like it's honestly you could show me this

**01:11:06** and tell me somebody made a puppet and put it and i would believe you like i would believe that it is

**01:11:12** real in many of these or that somebody sat down and drew this like i wouldn't believe you yeah you

**01:11:18** wouldn't look at it and think oh that was obviously a computer generated image absolutely

**01:11:23** not for like 75 of these look perfect and in particular the kind of weird photo realistic

**01:11:30** ones are interesting like there's a still of kermit the frog in total recall which doesn't

**01:11:35** look like an animation it really looks like oh someone made a model and then photographed or the

**01:11:41** twin peaks one uh way down there yeah so here's the the other thing is about this that i think is

**01:11:50** interesting to realize immediately is since this is a computer and you can just type in sentences

**01:11:56** you can generate hundreds of these very quickly in the time like it would take an actual artist to

**01:12:02** make this stuff you're looking at like oh this is thousands of human hours compressed down to a

**01:12:08** person's interesting afternoon so which is the one that you wanted me to find i don't know i can't

**01:12:13** even twin peaks okay i've got bojack horseman borderlands above that one eraser the eraserhead

**01:12:20** one is also really good um twin peaks is above the one peak ones right okay there we go yeah it

**01:12:27** just looks like a vinyl puppet yeah it looks like a vinyl puppet these things are really quite good

**01:12:32** this is the first one that caught my attention and so i think you're totally right in the timeline

**01:12:38** of how is this stuff going dolly is the first one that started getting people's attention

**01:12:45** and i think it's very easy to think like dolly is the best one but i've been following this

**01:12:50** more closely and what is really quite amazing is how fast this area is improving that twitter

**01:12:57** thread is from several months ago and i'm going to send you one which is a much more recent one

**01:13:04** this is a twitter thread that's comparing some of the different programs that are coming along and

**01:13:10** so dolly like you said is is a closed project you can't get public access to it but there's a group

**01:13:17** that's making another version of this which is called stable diffusion and this is like a publicly

**01:13:23** available open source version of the same thing and the amount of improvement that this one is

**01:13:30** making is absolutely freaking breathtaking of how good stable diffusion is and the thing with stable

**01:13:39** diffusion is unlike dolly which is sort of explicitly trying to be like art stable diffusion

**01:13:46** is just trying to make images so it's not necessarily trying to be like oh this is what

**01:13:51** the mona lisa would look like if picasso painted it i don't understand the distinction so i think

**01:13:58** the distinction can be summed up in one of the examples here which is if you scroll a little bit

**01:14:04** of the way down the prompt is behind the scenes shooting of the moon landing hollywood studio

**01:14:12** 1969 so the prompt there is create an image of the moon landing being faked in 1969

**01:14:21** and i think if if you look at those images stable diffusions one looks a lot more like just a natural

**01:14:28** photograph that someone would have taken whereas the dolly two one almost has a little bit of a

**01:14:34** feeling of like a renaissance painting right with the lighting and the way people are staying right

**01:14:38** but this is terrible right so this is but do you see what i mean like if someone showed you that

**01:14:44** stable diffusion yes it's like oh that just looks like a photograph that somebody took

**01:14:49** while the moon landing was being faked can't we with darley though ask it to be photo realistic

**01:14:55** now maybe that wasn't the prompt i don't know yeah so i think you have to be more explicit with the

**01:14:59** dolly stuff about trying to make it look real right because like right at the top of this thread

**01:15:04** there's one which is the prompt is film still portrait of an old man wrinkles dignified look

**01:15:10** grace overhead like the darley two one is like i mean stable diffusion is very good too but like

**01:15:16** that you know what actually looking at them i think i see what you mean from this one the

**01:15:22** darley two one looks like it's like an amazing pixar still if pixar did it where the stable

**01:15:27** diffusion one actually looks more like a photograph yeah the stable diffusion one looks like it's a

**01:15:32** real person yeah i get here's the key thing at this stage already what we're talking about is

**01:15:38** like incredibly subtle but i think it is interesting and important that stable diffusion isn't trying

**01:15:45** to be an interesting art project stable diffusion is it seems like they're really aiming for

**01:15:51** make an image of what we've typed anything like it and it just looks like an actual image it's not

**01:15:58** art focused i'll put all these links in the show notes by the way so people can go because you

**01:16:02** really should go see these images yeah so i think this is it's really caught my attention because i

**01:16:11** cannot think of an area of technology recently that i have seen progress as fast as it has

**01:16:21** as this area of a machine is able to make an image that you couldn't possibly tell that a human

**01:16:30** had not made and uh i think this is one of these things that is going to have an absolutely

**01:16:37** massive impact on the world very quickly like if you scroll down there's one that's

**01:16:45** particularly to me really captures the like what's going to happen with this

**01:16:50** and the prompt is low poly game asset kathulu monster isometric view and so this is generated

**01:17:01** what is a very good model for a computer game if you were going to have a little computer monster

**01:17:07** and you wanted it to be in this low poly art style well i mean the stable diffusion one didn't

**01:17:11** do a good job um yeah the stable diffusion one there i think this is actually where you see

**01:17:17** the very fact that stable diffusion is trying to do real images yeah is like oh the stable diffusion

**01:17:21** one isn't low poly it actually looks much more like a real thing dali too has done the best

**01:17:26** job there i think right you've asked for but that is also it's the most artistic style like it is

**01:17:33** the most artistic interpretation mid-journey is another one of these projects that's doing a

**01:17:38** similar kind of thing and i think the mid-journey one is quite interesting but it's like man i have

**01:17:43** seen this go from like very good to getting like incredibly specific and it seems to be getting

**01:17:51** much much faster so quickly and i look at this and i think man if i was in the graphic design

**01:17:59** world in particular i would be terrified right and stable diffusion i couldn't find any good

**01:18:05** examples this morning they're sort of one uh directly below there but they're they also have

**01:18:11** like a lot of generate clip art about whatever and one of the areas of weakness is often like

**01:18:17** human stuff but man like they're coming for stock photography here like i think this stuff is going

**01:18:22** to just absolutely blow through the whole industry of stock photography and just destroy its existence

**01:18:30** very fast if someone can instead of searching on a stock photo site for an image that happens to

**01:18:35** be the thing that they want like actually just type in you know i need three people in a room

**01:18:41** with this kind of laptop looking at a presentation that is this sort of thing what do you think about

**01:18:46** all this mike like what's what's your reaction looking at these images i don't like it okay why

**01:18:52** don't you like it i don't i don't think this is a good precedent i feel this way about deepfake

**01:19:00** technology i feel this way about audio ai technology which people are always trying to pitch me on

**01:19:08** oh yeah we get pitches from companies that are like why even read your ads anymore oh let us

**01:19:15** just feed the ad copy into a ai generated version of your voice and you can save all this time wow

**01:19:23** okay just like how about fundamentally let me tell you why i think that's a terrible thing

**01:19:29** right but there are people that want to do that to my voice i don't like the idea that somebody

**01:19:34** could take my voice and make me say whatever they want right and so that's the concern i have

**01:19:43** for this type of technology that it can be used to create fake materials and that moon landing

**01:19:49** thing is part of it right how will how will anybody in the future know what's true when

**01:19:57** in seconds you could create an image which looks real and share it we already have enough of a

**01:20:04** problem with people misunderstanding what an image means or misunderstanding what a sentence means

**01:20:12** what are we going to do when it is impossible to work out what's true by looking at something

**01:20:19** when someone can force you to have that misunderstanding based on showing you something

**01:20:24** you're supposed to believe of your eyes because your eyes tell you was true right you see this

**01:20:29** image like if you said to me oh my god look at this image that was released at the moon landing

**01:20:35** it was fake i would be like oh my god he's right because it just looks like that right and so that's

**01:20:44** part one and then part two is what i care about is artists individuals trying to make a living and

**01:20:51** what they want to do is they want to be illustrators and they want to illustrate things

**01:20:56** for newspapers or whatever and i worry about that entire industry of people that want to create

**01:21:03** like graphic design people like who work with you oh my god how easy would it be because you have

**01:21:09** such a defined art style there's so much of it so you know you you could just make all of your

**01:21:15** animations in theory based on feeding it prompts and i just don't like any i i i don't like the idea

**01:21:25** that all of these creative people would be put at risk because i don't believe in the idea of

**01:21:36** a computer being able to have the artistic vision of a human i just don't think that that's possible

**01:21:44** and the bigger issue is all of this is feeding on the back of people's human beings already's

**01:21:50** existing work right so go back to that comment thing we talk about the miyazaki movie well it

**01:21:57** can only generate that because the ai has been pointed to the miyazaki movies because there's

**01:22:02** no way it could know what that means you can't say to an ai create put come at the frog in spirited

**01:22:09** away if it's never seen what spirited away looks like so it can create this it's like we would be

**01:22:16** in a situation where there is no more new inspiration anymore we'll draw a line at 2045

**01:22:23** that was the last time that human beings were allowed to make anything of their own and now

**01:22:27** computers just make it all and we're in this continued refresh of content that's just made

**01:22:33** based on everything that came in the 100 years before it like i don't like this like this is a

**01:22:39** very fun thing to play around with because it's fun right now i don't like the future ramifications

**01:22:46** of this computer generated content where there's no human interaction outside of here's a string of

**01:22:53** text now it's done it makes me uncomfortable i worry about the future of creative endeavors

**01:23:02** because of technology like this yeah when you say a sentence like you don't think that the computer

**01:23:09** will be able to generate new things and it will always be a kind of remix i don't go along with

**01:23:16** that as a general statement like i but that is how ai works right so like you couldn't create an

**01:23:22** ai system without it having sucked in all this other information yeah yeah no don't talk about

**01:23:28** there's there's two separate issues here like like there's a lot in this conversation and there's

**01:23:33** there's one side that often comes out where people are like ah it'll never have the inspiration of a

**01:23:38** human and i do think that is true now and that probably will be true for a while but i don't

**01:23:45** think that's a fundamental truth i'm not sure we should pursue that anyway how about we stop before

**01:23:54** the point where we allow computers to think on their own how about that uh yes i didn't expect

**01:24:02** us to go like this hard this fast into this topic but i guess i also think why is this so interesting

**01:24:08** is because i think this is something that you can show to people and i have shown to people

**01:24:14** when if you try to have the conversation about oh actually i think ai is a terrifying existential

**01:24:20** threat for the human race people are like that's dumb and you're like okay tell me what you think

**01:24:25** a computer can't do and creativity is often very high up on that list this stuff is doing a bunch

**01:24:33** of remixing there is no denying about that but this is also just like blows past what a lot of

**01:24:39** people think computers would even be possible of doing creating this kind of art just immediately

**01:24:45** and the thing that i see happen in these conversations is people over the past few

**01:24:51** months have been pointing out they're going oh yeah the dolly stuff is really good but it's not

**01:24:56** great at textures you know oh you can see that the textures don't work perfectly on a bunch of the

**01:25:01** art that it generates it's like okay yeah cool you wait two months and they release the new version

**01:25:05** and you go oh it's way better at textures like it keeps getting better at all of the things that go

**01:25:09** oh it's not good it's not good at creating text on these images and it's like okay i've already

**01:25:14** seen it keep getting better and better at text at every iteration and i i just think the final

**01:25:19** version of that for people is always oh yeah but ultimately it can't be creative in a new way and

**01:25:27** i just like i just don't think that that argument will ultimately hold like i think there will be a

**01:25:31** version of this that generates new new stuff that isn't just remixes of the old things in in

**01:25:40** different kinds of ways and there's huge concerns about that i say the argument of like human

**01:25:47** human beings create this way we create based on what we've seen but i just don't understand why

**01:25:53** can't we just continue to like humans do that why do we now need to have machines do it why do we

**01:25:57** need to have an ai platform that can create artwork with little effort put in i don't i don't

**01:26:09** know why that's needed in the world right outside of it being a curiosity if well that's all it ever

**01:26:17** is is it just exists as it currently does like people share these things on twitter's like oh

**01:26:21** look at this funny thing that i made but that's not why people were building this yeah and i am

**01:26:27** not comfortable with the idea of suggesting that the work of artistic people should be replaced by

**01:26:43** ai systems i'm just not comfortable with that yeah i'll give you i'll give you something that

**01:26:49** makes me really uncomfortable so i'm gonna send you a link there's so many projects in this world

**01:26:55** like it's hard to keep all of the different groups straight so i'm simply not even going to try

**01:26:58** like there's there's another group that is working in this same field and it's a project

**01:27:04** that they're calling textual inversion and so right now with all of these systems you kind of

**01:27:11** type in oh karmat the frog but he's in blade runner and you try karmat the frog in a bunch

**01:27:16** of different things but what they what they don't have is any kind of sense of continuity so all of

**01:27:25** these things are just individual one-off prompts and either you write a prompt and you get a good

**01:27:31** image or you don't but you can't create like a series of related images because everything just

**01:27:38** exists independently so of course people were like aha that's why like this won't go everywhere

**01:27:44** because the machine doesn't really understand what you mean by like karmat the frog you can't

**01:27:49** create a little animation with a stable karmat the frog all of these things are just one-offs

**01:27:54** and it's like oh well textual inversion is working to solve that problem where they're working to

**01:28:01** really nail down a particular concept that can then be expressed by these machines and so they

**01:28:09** have a bunch of examples on this page of like hey if you give the computer a bunch of images

**01:28:16** it's really going to try to nail down pulling out a particular concept that you want to repeat

**01:28:24** and to make this process easier and so like okay you scroll down on their page and like there's a

**01:28:29** bunch of AI generated art images but i just happen i just happen to click on one and follow it through

**01:28:36** and it i think it gets to the heart of like boy this is really uncomfortable so they have a

**01:28:41** section called learning to represent styles you feed it a bunch of somebody's art and you try to

**01:28:49** teach it this is a style that this person has made and so they say like okay here's these four images

**01:28:56** that we've inputted and now we can say like oh what if this person was to paint the the streets

**01:29:03** of paris what if this person was to paint an adorable corgi and they have this art style

**01:29:08** that's kind of like a colorful psychedelic style and they happen to credit whose art style that is

**01:29:15** and so it's this person called queenie art and i clicked and went to follow this person

**01:29:23** and it's someone on deviant art who died from cancer great yeah this is what we want oh

**01:29:30** like i i presume that this was someone whose permission you got to be part of the project

**01:29:37** no this is a person who was an artist on deviant art and like had a very unique style and their

**01:29:45** last post on deviant art is from several years ago saying they have stage four cancer and they're

**01:29:51** not going to live for another year i'm sorry what the f**k just happened here we could we can talk

**01:29:58** about like the machines copying people's styles but this is a particularly awful example of like

**01:30:05** oh did did the people who put together this project even know like or they just don't

**01:30:10** worry gray it says image reproduction authorized for non-commercial use only yeah so it's okay

**01:30:17** yeah that's the reason it caught my attention is they had they had this explicit disclaimer like

**01:30:22** we've made new art in this dead person style it's for non-commercial use only that was the whole

**01:30:27** reason i clicked the link i was like oh what's the deal with this artist i wonder did they put

**01:30:31** a bunch of stuff in the creative comment like i just i just didn't know i was curious and then i

**01:30:35** just copyright intended it's fine it's like i stumbled upon like oh they're dead i feel like

**01:30:41** the world has been bumping up against this concept in a variety of different ways yeah

**01:30:47** like the first place you start to see this is like oh having dead actors in movies and like okay

**01:30:53** there's a bunch of ways in which you can kind of clear the rights on this but now we have computer

**01:30:59** programs that are just like hoovering up everything that exists on the internet and then also being

**01:31:07** able to like target an individual okay that person we want the machine to make more of that person

**01:31:16** and they're dead just do it and it that feels really awful it feels really awful in in so many

**01:31:22** ways it's like an abuse of some kind well like i'm trying to think of the word but it's like

**01:31:28** wrong it just feels wrong it's like taking advantage of them yeah in a way like i don't

**01:31:36** it's very uncomfortable that's a terrible example yeah i know right it's like it's one of the worst

**01:31:42** things i've stumbled upon in this whole world like and i don't you know i don't know the backstory

**01:31:46** like you know maybe there's some like really reasonable explanation for this hey look maybe

**01:31:51** this person will contribute to this whatever but like yeah point is not necessarily this one it is

**01:31:58** just a proof of the point that this can and will happen yeah right yeah and and that there's there's

**01:32:04** like teams that are trying to solve the very specific problem of oh we want to be able to

**01:32:11** replicate an exact thing consistently a bunch with like a stable concept of like this person's art

**01:32:18** style like or this object and and maintained it over time this is so messed up yeah it's incredibly

**01:32:25** messed up and i i just keep wondering when one of these systems is going to come across some kind of

**01:32:36** copyright constraint and like the miyazaki one is really the one that that kind of

**01:32:41** caught my attention because you feel like miyazaki's movies they're beloved and is often the case with

**01:32:48** someone who creates art that is beloved it's partly because that creator has very specific

**01:32:54** ideas about how they want their artwork created very often how they want it distributed what

**01:33:02** circumstances under which they view it i think another good example of this is that i always

**01:33:08** think of and give huge respect to is is the author of calvin and hobs like calvin and hobs is a hugely

**01:33:13** successful strip comic book strip and part of the reason is because the creator was incredibly picky

**01:33:21** about how is this reproduced he like he never wanted it merchandised he never wanted like a

**01:33:27** bunch of different things done with it and that's part of the reason why like oh these comics they're

**01:33:34** really untouched and magical in a way that very few things are in the modern world and like i cannot

**01:33:40** express how sad i would be if someone was like oh hey i made an ai that just spits out brand new

**01:33:46** calvin and hob strips all the time because i'm sad that the author isn't making them anymore it's

**01:33:51** like no please please don't do that that's that's terrible and also kind of like ruins the thing

**01:33:57** that you're trying to do like i don't know i i feel like there's incredible and scary economic

**01:34:05** impacts for everyone who works in the art world in any way and there's also just massive society

**01:34:15** impacts coming from this kind of thing in like every possible direction that you can look like

**01:34:21** you said there's this weird kind of taking advantage of people who've put their art out in the world

**01:34:29** and then there's just the like you said the mere question of man like if you thought it was hard to

**01:34:35** know what things are real before when you can fake photographic and we all know very soon

**01:34:42** video evidence of anything is like man that is terrible for the world i mean look

**01:34:52** if this was such a thing that could be constrained to isn't this a fun little curiosity i have no

**01:34:59** problem with it i think it's fun to see this stuff produced right like to see people create

**01:35:06** and comment the frog in the style of twin peaks it's like this is really funny right like this is

**01:35:12** like a funny little thing share it on twitter and everybody says hey look what i put into dali right

**01:35:18** i have no problem with that because it's like well here's the thing we're doing and it's like

**01:35:22** like not no problem i have barely having problems it's just like whatever we know it's a fake image

**01:35:27** etc yeah in the same way that if an if an actual human had created like hey i'm a real fan of

**01:35:33** kurmit the frog and i'm a real fan of blade runner yeah look at me i put i put them together

**01:35:38** like i don't think anyone would really have a problem with that like it doesn't it doesn't

**01:35:42** matter it's just like oh this is fun fan art of things that you like but it's the next phase of

**01:35:47** it that i just can't reconcile in my brain of like what comes after this then what happens to

**01:35:57** special effects artists what happens to illustrators what happens to podcasters like what happens

**01:36:05** if we just decide that we're all good with the ai just doing this for us

**01:36:13** um i just don't i just don't think it's i don't think it's a good thing and it's we don't need it

**01:36:20** right and so i don't really understand what the point of it is especially when there's going to

**01:36:29** be a selection of people that take this technology package it and sell it to companies to be like you

**01:36:41** don't need this anymore like all these people give us some money which is less and you can use

**01:36:48** our software yeah what i have just seen develop recently with this stuff is the beginning of the

**01:36:54** commercialization of it and so there's a weird website which i don't entirely understand like

**01:37:00** how this how or why this works but there's a there's a website already where people can like

**01:37:04** buy or sell good prompts for generating art because right right now since it is so costly

**01:37:12** to generate this stuff like you don't want to mess around unnecessarily it's like already people are

**01:37:18** doing this thing of like oh i can sell you a pack of prompts that will help you cut down on the

**01:37:24** difficulty of figuring out what looks cool actually there's a good article i found which is trying to

**01:37:29** get an image of like a llama playing basketball like the key phrase is that you want our dramatic

**01:37:33** backlighting like that's one of the things that makes this photo of a llama playing basketball

**01:37:37** awesome but so i think that this website is is trying to commercialize that but the most

**01:37:43** directly commercial thing that i've seen which i'll send you is a photoshop plugin that connects to

**01:37:51** stable diffusion and so it's like okay this is already being worked into professional tools

**01:37:59** and you can see like oh using this plugin a photoshop expert who doesn't have any artistic skill

**01:38:06** can just start selecting images of the screen and ask stable diffusion to fill in what they

**01:38:12** actually want in this image and i just think like oh my god like here we go like this is totally the

**01:38:18** beginning of it has real commercial purposes it is not just a like you said a fun toy and given

**01:38:27** how fast this stuff has developed like i cannot imagine where this is going to be a year from now

**01:38:33** i keep seeing people say like oh you know you're not going to be able to make video out of this

**01:38:38** like it's just going to be still images like guys video i hate to break it to you it's just a

**01:38:43** sequence of still images like it's not magic it's just way more computationally intensive but i've

**01:38:49** already seen videos on youtube that i am absolutely sure are 100 percent ai generated where it's like

**01:38:57** there's a voice it sounds pretty good but it makes me suspicious like i don't think it's actually a

**01:39:02** person it basically sounds like it's summarizing through language models like a wikipedia article

**01:39:10** about a topic and they have you know a bunch of stock images which are mostly connected to the

**01:39:17** narration but not entirely and it's like that stuff exists on youtube already like i'm very

**01:39:22** certain that those things are ai generated and they're just gonna keep getting better and better

**01:39:27** and better and i was like i met a guy at a conference who was working on some ai research stuff

**01:39:35** and he said that he had instituted this guideline that he was no longer reading or watching anything

**01:39:44** that he wasn't absolutely sure was produced by a real person at the time i thought this was kind

**01:39:52** of crazy right i thought like whoa dude you know you're really like that's a real stance to take

**01:39:59** and you know the more i see of the stuff that stable diffusion is doing the more i feel like

**01:40:04** man i don't know like maybe that just is a good policy very soon like only read stuff that you

**01:40:11** know is written by a person because we like we just haven't touched on it here but i think the

**01:40:16** art stuff really visually catches people's attention but there are projects that do this

**01:40:22** with language where they write things and can you tell that a person did or did not write this

**01:40:27** sentence no you can't tell and like the language models are also getting very very good very fast

**01:40:35** and they're also really starting to understand human concepts in a way that's like boy this is

**01:40:42** all just absolutely terrifying so yeah i don't know maybe it's significantly less crazy now than

**01:40:50** it was at the time or maybe like oh this guy just could kind of see what was coming but

**01:40:54** yeah i don't i don't know how we're going to survive in a world where it is incredibly cheap

**01:41:04** to produce a huge amount of content and distribute that content widely compared to

**01:41:11** what humans can create and just distribute like we have enough problems sorting through the world

**01:41:18** but it's just dealing with stuff that humans make i don't know how this is going to go down when

**01:41:24** at some point the majority of material being generated is not being generated by humans like

**01:41:30** i think that that is going to be a very confusing world to live in before we go

**01:41:37** on that cheery note for action you can take today for something that is unambiguously good
