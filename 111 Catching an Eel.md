# Cortex - 111: Catching an Eel
**00:00:00** Main recorder is going. Levels are levels are leveled.

**00:00:04** Okay. Show notes. We're good to go. Great. Good to go for 111.

**00:00:10** One of the things I like about our show is I think that a lot of people can go back and

**00:00:14** listen to any point of it and find something in the episodes that are relative. I think a lot of

**00:00:20** our show is mostly timeless. You know, there are things that are happening in our lives at that

**00:00:25** time, but people can relate to them with where they are in their own working lives.

**00:00:29** However, the kind of thing that is happening right now, I don't think is going to be as timeless

**00:00:35** and dates the show quite a lot. And we'll date it into the future. What I'm talking about is,

**00:00:41** in fact, we're back in lockdown. So, you know, it's like, I don't know if people are going to

**00:00:45** be able to relate to lockdown in four years time. I certainly hope not, but I'm back at home again.

**00:00:53** Oh yeah. I have a big bias towards evergreen content. I don't like to date things.

**00:00:59** Especially for this show. Like it really, I think is a great benefit to the show.

**00:01:04** I don't know if people can go back. You know, it's like, I said this, I think when we did episode

**00:01:08** 100, I actually really like that we've only very recently passed 100 episodes of this show,

**00:01:14** even though we've been making it for 25 years or whatever it is. Because it still means that

**00:01:20** somebody coming to the show, even now, after so many years of doing the show, that they can

**00:01:24** consume the whole thing in what is not an obscene amount of time, I think.

**00:01:29** Yes. And experience the rapid time warp of going through all of the changes in our life

**00:01:35** and then catching up to the current point, which I actually think can be a kind of useful lesson

**00:01:41** to hear people talking about their working lives, like in this accelerated way, like you can kind

**00:01:47** of gain something from that. The span of like, I've had a great idea too, that didn't work,

**00:01:51** which for us is like nine months, but they can get through it in like five hours.

**00:01:56** Right, right. Or theme inauguration to theme completion, 12 episodes.

**00:02:04** But yes, I completely agree that this year has been less of a timeless year. And another lockdown

**00:02:13** is less evergreen content, or it may very well be evergreen content. Who knows? Because I feel like,

**00:02:23** goddamn, when I was talking to you last time, I was very much in the, oh, it's all over mode.

**00:02:32** And then we get lockdown two. Well, it's actually not lockdown two. It's like lockdown. Well,

**00:02:38** we had one in the middle, but it wasn't really an actual lockdown, I guess.

**00:02:44** No one took those seriously, Mike. I did.

**00:02:48** I'm glad you did. I did. But, you know, from my peaking's outside, people didn't take it super

**00:02:55** seriously. And so this is lockdown two, because it's the second big one. So how has it impacted

**00:03:03** your working life, Mike? Yes, I'm back at home again. It's packed up the studio. Packed up the

**00:03:08** studio. What do you mean by that? Well, I always say to some people, what I mean is I went there

**00:03:12** and I collected up a bunch of gear. Okay. Then just like made sure that like, all right,

**00:03:18** is everything off? You know, like all that kind of stuff, because it's like, it's going to be a

**00:03:22** while. Right. So I just went and took care of everything. But I did that on the 1st of January,

**00:03:28** which was before lockdown began, because we could see where it was going. And we had decided we were

**00:03:37** like, gray style locking down, because it was clearly getting out of control again. We didn't

**00:03:44** know at that point why, right? Like we know now, like the variants and all that stuff, like it was

**00:03:49** things were getting out of hand. We've been, you know, we've been working at home for about three

**00:03:55** weeks ish. It feels better this time than the other two times that I've made this like transition

**00:04:02** from studio back to home for a couple of reasons, set the office up a bit more permanently,

**00:04:09** tidied it. I also brought home enough gear to continue streaming. Like that was important to

**00:04:14** me because that would have been a real bummer. Ah, okay. Yeah, that's interesting. If I wouldn't

**00:04:19** have been able to do that. So I brought home enough gear to do all of that. And I've got like

**00:04:24** a second desk set up, like I would have at the studio. So I still have like the desk where I

**00:04:29** record and then desk where I do my work and do streaming from and stuff. The other thing that

**00:04:34** does feel better is unlike the other times, I do feel like there is an end in sight. Okay. And it

**00:04:41** has not felt that way up until now. You know, like there is hope now for this ending in a way that

**00:04:49** there wasn't before. You know, especially with the first lockdown where it was kind of like,

**00:04:54** when do you think we'll be able to go back to, you know, like it was that was they were the kinds

**00:04:58** of questions that everybody was having. Like, I know we would talk about it. Like, what's your

**00:05:02** best guess on this? And now, you know, the vaccination program is rolling out. There wasn't

**00:05:09** one before, right? Like, especially the first lockdown, the like March to whenever it was locked

**00:05:15** down. Well, vaccines take years. So settle in. Yeah. I mean, that's true. I know my thought

**00:05:21** early on was there's not going to be a vaccine. Like from what I'd read, it's like, Oh,

**00:05:26** seems like no one's ever developed a vaccine for this kind of novel coronavirus before. So,

**00:05:31** like, I wouldn't I wouldn't put money on there will be one. So that has definitely been a nice

**00:05:37** surprise outcome. So I see what you mean there. And I can't wait to read tellings of this in

**00:05:43** years to come of like, well, if the entire world and its resources are focused on one problem,

**00:05:49** you'd be surprised how fast we can move stuff forward. Right. Like,

**00:05:53** if every scientist in all of these fields are all just attacking one issue, stuff can happen

**00:06:00** quite quickly, you know, like, which is, you know, it's a triumph. And it's interesting. But I

**00:06:06** look forward to retellings of this in the future of like, getting a bit of a like a 50,000 foot

**00:06:11** view on it. But yeah, I know that like, you know, it was I didn't know enough about this stuff. And

**00:06:17** it was a concern, you know, like, my hope would be that that they would work it out. But I spoke to

**00:06:22** enough people that were like, I don't know. Right. And so now, that's the difference. It's like,

**00:06:29** yeah, all right, we've got many more months of this. But I feel like there is an end for me now.

**00:06:36** And I just have to move towards that. I'm happy for you, Mike. I'm just trying to I'm trying to

**00:06:41** hold back the question of when do you think the end is and why? Like, I don't have a clear

**00:06:50** answer on that. But I also feel bad for even asking you and putting that in your head.

**00:06:54** No, I'm fine with it. Like, I, okay, I believe that in the spring, I will be able to leave the

**00:07:01** house and go back to the studio again. But I know the situation will have not gone away.

**00:07:09** Okay, okay. So that's that's that's what you're thinking about is what's what's the timeline for

**00:07:14** glorious reunification with mega studio? Yeah. And that's I'm thinking spring, I'm thinking like

**00:07:19** March, like maybe in March. And then my expectation is by the end of the year,

**00:07:26** I will be able to get vaccinated. Right. Okay. But like, it's it basically my what I like now is I

**00:07:33** feel like I can see two endpoints, which is what I want, which is like, when can I go back to how I

**00:07:39** was in the summer? Which was, I could go to the studio every day, and walk from the studio,

**00:07:47** and it was no problem, really. And then by the end of the year, I believe I'll be able to get

**00:07:53** vaccinated. And then I'll be able to resume even more of a normal life for whatever that's gonna

**00:07:59** look like after that. But you know, the idea of like being able to see friends and family being

**00:08:04** able to go to restaurants, like that stuff, you know, I have hoped that by the end of the year,

**00:08:10** now, that's more of a possibility than it has been up until this point. Right. Okay. Okay,

**00:08:15** that makes sense. That makes sense. Do you have any different opinion? No, no, I just I wasn't

**00:08:21** quite sure what you meant by being over. And yeah, so this is I think like you're expressing what I

**00:08:31** talked about before about like this, this importance of having specific dates on the horizon,

**00:08:39** or at least specific ish dates, that being in lockdown and just being like, Oh, I guess this is

**00:08:47** for an indefinite period of time is way harder than, okay, I'm going to buckle down until March.

**00:08:54** And I expect by March to be back to this, this particular state of things.

**00:08:59** So yeah, my emotional state right now is vastly improved on my emotional state when we had

**00:09:06** locked down 1.5. Right. Okay, that's good. Because that was just like, well, what then,

**00:09:12** you know, it's like, all right, I'll do it. But like, what, you know, like, how long is this gonna

**00:09:16** last? Where are we, you know, like, it was that kind of feeling. But now it's kind of like, this

**00:09:22** is just a hump to get over, I'm going to stay at home again for a few months. And then we'll be

**00:09:27** able to try and get back to where we were eight months ago or whatever, six months ago.

**00:09:33** Okay, yeah, that makes sense. I don't have any real mental estimate on the timeline. I feel like

**00:09:41** I'd back your statement that I would expect to be vaccinated by the end of the year,

**00:09:47** perhaps like September, maybe optimistically. September is my date too. That's like where

**00:09:55** I'm thinking. The only reason I hesitate is because once the vaccine came out, I was

**00:10:00** with everyone I was talking to, I was very optimistic about, oh, vaccine rollout will

**00:10:04** be way faster than people expect. Because I think this is the kind of problem that humans are

**00:10:09** actually quite good at solving is, okay, we've made the thing. Now it's like a scale and logistics

**00:10:15** issue. My only hesitation there is just, I didn't quite properly parse in my head that there's two

**00:10:21** problems here, which is manufacture and distribution. And then what I can categorize as

**00:10:28** the last mile, which is, okay, we need to get like jabs into people's arms. And that's the

**00:10:36** part where it seems like humans have floundered quite a lot. And so that's the only reason I just

**00:10:41** worry a little bit is what, like that last mile distribution seems to be running into a bunch of

**00:10:49** very unexpected barriers. But that's my only caution of like, if I don't get vaccinated this

**00:10:57** year, that would be my expectation for like, what was the stumbling block?

**00:11:01** It seems like the plans here are relatively aggressive if they can actually act the way

**00:11:06** that they're suggesting the army's getting involved, which makes sense.

**00:11:13** That was a nice long pause there. But yeah, like you need people to actually...

**00:11:17** Every time you say the army's getting involved, you know the situation isn't great. Right?

**00:11:23** I mean, I don't know what it's like in other countries, particularly, but I know that that

**00:11:27** tends to be the thing here. It's like, there is a disaster of some impact. And now the army's

**00:11:32** involved. And it's like, Oh, God, like anytime the army is involved in anything domestic here, like,

**00:11:38** the has hit the fan in quite a significant way. Yes. And so that's where we are. And like,

**00:11:42** I think I saw the Brigadier General, I think that was his phrase, which I just love that.

**00:11:47** That was a title. Brigadier General just sounds so fancy. He says something like, you know,

**00:11:52** we have logistical skills, we can try and get this done, but it is also kind of like

**00:11:58** building a national supermarket in a month. And I was like, okay, I see that. Right? Like, I get it.

**00:12:07** Good luck. I hope you solve that problem. I'm glad it's not my problem. That's the feeling there.

**00:12:15** And now the Cortexon who's listening in speed mode to this in a two years time.

**00:12:22** They know how it went. Yeah, they know how it went. They're either thinking, Oh, well, you know,

**00:12:26** what are they talking about or how relevant this evergreen content is, but I'm glad you're feeling

**00:12:31** better. This episode of Cortex is brought to you by Command Line Heroes. Command Line Heroes is a

**00:12:37** podcast that tells epic true tales of developers, programmers, hackers, geeks, and open source

**00:12:44** rebels who have revolutionized the technology landscape. Season six of command line heroes is

**00:12:50** available now. And this season tells the story of black technologists who innovated and invented

**00:12:55** despite systemic racism, unfair hiring practices, and unequal education opportunities. There's an

**00:13:01** episode all about Gladys West, whose mathematical models and data analysis paved the way for GPS.

**00:13:08** Another episode tells the story of Jerry Lawson, who invented the first cartridge based video game

**00:13:13** console, paving the way for Atari, Nintendo, Sega, and others. Another episode tells the story of

**00:13:19** Mark Dean, who grew up in the Jim Crow South and revolutionized the PC industry with the ISA bus.

**00:13:25** I got a sneak preview of season six of command line heroes. The episode I heard was all about Dr.

**00:13:30** Gladys West and hearing her overcome the struggles of being a young black woman trying to make her

**00:13:35** way through the scientific field in the fifties and sixties was really inspiring. The episode

**00:13:40** features fantastic interviews. I really like hearing these stories directly from the people

**00:13:45** involved and getting to hear Dr. West's story is something that made this show really special to me.

**00:13:50** I think you should give it a lesson. There are people whose work has not been celebrated until

**00:13:54** now, so we should make sure to celebrate them right. Search for command line heroes anywhere

**00:13:58** that you listen to podcasts and we'll include a link in the show notes as well. Our thanks to command

**00:14:03** line heroes for their support of this show and relay FM. Little follow up in the theme

**00:14:08** system journal, gray, happy new year. Happy new theme to everybody. This is our first episode of

**00:14:13** 2021. Yeah. The theme system journal went on sale for our last episode. We sold out in a week,

**00:14:20** pretty much. It was unexpected. So, you know, we spoke about it last time. We had a larger

**00:14:26** audit and we've ever had before and we were putting them up and we figured we'd have stock

**00:14:32** for a while. But there was one thing that we said was like, you were going to promote it on your

**00:14:36** YouTube channel, which we'd not done before. And we genuinely didn't know what that was going to do.

**00:14:41** Basically, we sold half in just under a week and then the other half in two days,

**00:14:48** which was after you put up your video. Yeah. Complete honesty. This far exceeded our best

**00:14:54** expectation. Oh yeah. Yeah, totally. Like we weren't being foolish. We weren't being like

**00:14:59** reserved. We really didn't think that it was going to, that this was going to happen. And

**00:15:04** I'll try and put it in perspective a bit. So the order that we made was 75% of the total value

**00:15:11** that we have ever sold up until that point. So I really thought that we would have enough

**00:15:17** for at least a couple of months. Yeah. But we didn't. Yeah, no, we didn't. And also I think

**00:15:24** with me promoting the journal on my YouTube channel, I think that is one of the most

**00:15:33** nervous I have been about uploading a video in quite a while, because I really had the feeling

**00:15:39** of I must've messaged you a million times. Like I'm very uncertain. Like who knows how this is

**00:15:45** going to work out. Yeah. This was all very weird for a lot of reasons. Yeah. Because like one,

**00:15:51** there have been lots of times where you have shared ideas with me that you're working on.

**00:15:55** You may be like, show me a thing and say like, Hey, what's your thoughts on this? This was very

**00:15:59** different because like I was kind of actually involved. Yeah. Because this was our thing that

**00:16:05** you were making a video about and like you would run things by me. And it was like, it was,

**00:16:10** it was a weird feeling for me like to be in that process with you. And then

**00:16:17** we ended up putting up the video at a time that wasn't expected. And it went up on its own.

**00:16:23** Everything about it was like, this is weird and uncertain. You know, like, I think as I mentioned

**00:16:28** last time, I kind of got myself into a position in December where I was just working on too many

**00:16:33** things. Yeah. And so there was supposed to be a main video that was going to go along at the same

**00:16:41** time as the journal video went up. And it just, you know, I had a big phone call with you about it

**00:16:49** and we were talking about options and like, I don't think this is going to work out. It's like,

**00:16:53** I'm not going to have that main video ready. And I made the call just to do the journal on its own,

**00:16:58** which even there, like just for someone who runs a YouTube channel, like you're always worried when

**00:17:02** you do something different. Like you just don't know how people are going to react, which is a

**00:17:07** whole issue that's completely separate from, I don't know how many journals this video is going

**00:17:12** to sell. I have no idea. Everything was so uncertain. Like it might not make sense on the

**00:17:18** face of it, but we actually believed that less people could see the video putting it up on its own.

**00:17:24** Yeah. Which is like, it's like a very weird thing that you were explaining to me from the YouTube

**00:17:29** algorithm that if it like isn't what your viewers are expecting, because it's not a full on video,

**00:17:34** that they might not click it in the first few seconds. Yeah. So there's a weird thing to explain,

**00:17:38** which is the video has done better than I expected by about twice as much, but still probably half

**00:17:47** as many views as I would expect if it had gone out with the main video is my like mental

**00:17:53** estimation of where it is. And yeah, that totally is an effect that like YouTube is extremely

**00:18:00** sensitive to, and I hate this about YouTube, but I know it's a change that they've made,

**00:18:04** but like they're really sensitive to click through rates and retention in like the first

**00:18:11** five or 10 seconds for the very first people who are watching the videos. And yeah. So I thought

**00:18:16** like, Oh man, I think this, this could end up being shown to very few people. If like the algorithm

**00:18:22** gods just decide straight away that they don't like it. But not that it matters because in any

**00:18:28** way, like this is all this, this thing where we really weren't sure. And if we were making the

**00:18:32** right, but it ended up being the right decision, because if it would have gone out of the main

**00:18:36** video and got more views, we would have had double than not amount of journals, right? Like,

**00:18:42** so it ended up being a weird chain of events that resulted in the best worst case scenario.

**00:18:50** Yeah. No, I'm, yeah, I'm very glad at the way it went out because again, this, this is another

**00:18:54** thing where if you're running a business, I always think of this thing talking about like

**00:18:59** in economics and how, how do you price things? And if you're a, if you're a store, you always want

**00:19:04** like a little line, like that means that your price is just right. If you have a really long

**00:19:09** line, like the prices is probably too low. And if you have no line, the price is too high.

**00:19:14** And there's, there's something similar here where we have the inventory and what we don't want

**00:19:22** is a long line of people who also then can't get the thing. So it totally worked out that yes,

**00:19:28** the video didn't get shown to say twice as many people, all of whom wouldn't have been able to

**00:19:34** get it anyway. So yeah, we did, we did really, we did really luck out with that. But yes,

**00:19:40** I was the most nervous ever. And I was sending you drafts of the script and I was like, what do

**00:19:46** you think about this Mike? But it went out very well. And I think we've both been very surprised

**00:19:53** at how well it's, how well it sold. We just weren't expecting it. We really did think we probably had

**00:19:59** months of inventory, but that turned out to not be the case. Again, again, there is a difference

**00:20:06** this time though. Yeah. So but the week this episode goes live, by the end of that week,

**00:20:13** the next batch starts printing. And that is unprecedented for us in speed. And this is one

**00:20:20** of the great benefits we've had in moving on manufacturing. The plan right now, as it stands

**00:20:25** right now, is that we will have the same amount again, ready to go to be shipped in early February.

**00:20:34** So barring any holdups or shipping issues of which there could be many of both,

**00:20:40** we expect to have more on sale in early March. Yeah. And this does feel like, okay,

**00:20:46** we underestimated inventory, but we are finally in the position where when that occurs,

**00:20:54** we can restock on a reasonable timeframe and we don't have any of those kinds of problems before.

**00:21:00** So that's a huge deal because it's also a thing that, you know, we think with the journal, like,

**00:21:06** oh, you want to use the journal for a season and then use it for the next season. Like we want to

**00:21:12** be able to have the inventory ready for that. And it feels like we're finally in that place where

**00:21:18** the journals are no longer one-off items. I think you should feel hugely accomplished, Mike,

**00:21:25** at getting to that place. Like you really should. Yeah. I feel very good about it. That I've been,

**00:21:31** this is an analogy I've been had in my mind for a while, like stock management,

**00:21:35** which is what we're trying to do. It's like trying to catch an eel. Like you can barely see it most

**00:21:42** of the time. And then you think you've spotted it and you try and grab it and you do, but it slips

**00:21:47** right out of your hand. Right. It's just like, it's like an impossible thing. Like sometimes

**00:21:52** you think you've got it, but you don't, you know, and it's like, I know people hear the numbers,

**00:21:59** like, why don't you just order more? And I wished it was as simple as that.

**00:22:05** Right. Well, yeah, your eel metaphor doesn't work because there's also the reason people go,

**00:22:11** why don't you just order more? It's because like, well, in this scenario, if you try to catch the

**00:22:16** eel too hard, you go out of business. So that's like, that's the problem is you have to catch the

**00:22:24** eel, but not too much. It's like, Oh, well just put the eel in an eel sized tub and you'll get it.

**00:22:31** It's like, yeah, but now, now the eel's too big. Right. Yeah. So like that, that is constantly the

**00:22:39** flip side is order too much bigger problem. The dream is over. Right. Like, so as I said,

**00:22:47** like, I think it's a, it's a big number, right? 75% of the total amount that we had sold up until

**00:22:53** that point. And we had been selling them for a year and a half. Yeah. Right. We ordered a very

**00:22:59** large amount, but it's very hard to try and predict buying patterns. This is something that I was, I

**00:23:07** can't remember who I was talking to about. So I was talking to a friend about this recently.

**00:23:10** And they said to me, you know, lots of companies employ teams of people to make these decisions.

**00:23:16** Okay. That, that makes me feel better because a thing that has been constantly niggling at the

**00:23:21** back of my mind, and I've searched for every once in a while on Google is I'm like, this feels like

**00:23:27** someone's PhD thesis is how to write a good algorithm for predictive inventory. And like,

**00:23:35** this must exist. Like there's gotta be a formula which, which like abstracts away

**00:23:40** all the details of the business and can reduce it down to here's inventory. Here's sales in x

**00:23:48** period of time. And then here's the restock numbers for same. Like, what is the algorithm to

**00:23:54** even this curve out? Like it must exist. But since you're telling me that companies employ teams of

**00:23:59** people to try to solve this problem, my dream of, Oh, I just don't know the correct Google keyword

**00:24:05** to find the solution to all of our problems was just a dream and a fantasy that this does not exist.

**00:24:11** Yeah. Cause it's like the scales are all messed up, right? Like we've been selling merchandise

**00:24:17** for years, right? But the scales that we're selling these things on a completely different.

**00:24:22** And it's because it's a completely different type of product. And the time of year that we're

**00:24:25** selling it is different. The outlook of people makes a difference. It's like, you know, because

**00:24:31** we, we had some journals that we were selling at a discount, right? Cause we started selling them in

**00:24:36** August cause it was so delayed. And I guess people just didn't want to buy the journals in August in

**00:24:42** the pandemic year of 2020. And that was like a theory that I went in. So like we were nervous

**00:24:49** about ordering the amount that we ordered because we hadn't completely sold out of the

**00:24:53** smaller amount that we'd ordered six months prior or eight months prior. But I was coming

**00:24:59** into it thinking like, no, no, I believe that people maybe abandoned their themes because the

**00:25:05** world changed and they were like, I'll just do another one in 2021. So I feel confident that

**00:25:09** this is a good amount and I was right, but not right enough. And we talked about that decision

**00:25:15** a lot. And this is also one of these things where I'm always aware you have to be worried

**00:25:22** about telling stories to yourself sometimes. And, and this is a thing where I was aware that we,

**00:25:29** we were just like making up stories about why. So we said, oh, we haven't sold out the run of the

**00:25:36** first journals. Uh, why? Oh, maybe it's August and people don't want to, maybe it's the pandemic,

**00:25:42** but there's no data for any of this. It's just like a little fairy tale story. Yeah. And,

**00:25:47** but, but the thing is like, you just know from experience, he's got feelings, you know,

**00:25:54** I don't think they have a high predictive output. And so that's why I think both of us were also

**00:26:02** feeling cautious about what we already felt like was too big of an order. That was part of my

**00:26:10** feeling is like, okay, we haven't sold out version one. Yes. Maybe, maybe it's the problem of, of like,

**00:26:17** you know, oh, when, when you think a new Mac is coming, you don't buy the old version like,

**00:26:22** oh, maybe it's this kind of issue with, with selling. Oh yeah. That was the other thing.

**00:26:26** I believed a lot of people were, were holding off because they knew there was a version two coming.

**00:26:30** Yeah. And, and, and maybe that's true. Maybe that's not true. And the killer thing is

**00:26:36** we'll never know, right? Like we just have speculation, but you just, you just can't

**00:26:41** predict this stuff at all. And again, it's high stakes, eel catching is what it is.

**00:26:47** So everybody that bought one, thank you so much. It is, you know, I consider one of my greatest

**00:26:54** professional accomplishments to this point that people bought it and they seem to really like it.

**00:27:00** The feedback has been very, very good. And I'm so happy. And if you weren't able to get one,

**00:27:06** we're very sorry. We're working very hard. They'll be back in stock soon. If you're using one now,

**00:27:11** and you're thinking, am I going to be able to get one of these? We're going to have more in stock. So

**00:27:15** hopefully if you're using the system, you'll be able to pick one up. I guess, you know, I really

**00:27:21** don't like to say this, but I'm going to say it. Like if you're using it and you think this is

**00:27:26** really great, I want to keep using it. Just buy one as soon as they go back on stock again.

**00:27:30** Because then you'll know there's a lot of stuff that happens during these processes that we cannot

**00:27:36** conceive of until they happen. And, you know, it's like what I'm saying, like we're, we're expecting

**00:27:42** to have the ship in in February, but the factory could go into lockdown, right? I don't know,

**00:27:48** but it could happen. And then we're going to be waiting again. So I will just say, Mike, I think

**00:27:55** you, you are in the position of having much more bloody firsthand contact with what the problems

**00:28:02** are. I'm in the trenches on this one, gray. I'm not going to lie. Yeah. You are deep in the trenches

**00:28:07** and you have that hollow look in your eyes, right? For having been in that experience for a while.

**00:28:14** My overview here is I feel very confident that we have, as soon as we get the next order,

**00:28:26** we will have solved the problem of restocking because all of the major uncertainties are now

**00:28:33** over. You know, people knew we were working on the second version and that, that has been resolved.

**00:28:38** There was the uncertainty about the YouTube audience sales that has been resolved and the

**00:28:45** production timeline for order and restock has been dramatically shrunken so that it's very achievable

**00:28:56** to now have an idea of like, okay, when inventory hits this number, we reorder this number. And I,

**00:29:04** I feel like this is a solved problem going forward. So that's, that's my feeling on it, Mike.

**00:29:11** I'm happy for you. I know you've been through a lot, but that's how I feel about this.

**00:29:17** What I'll say is the two places you can sign up, if we're out of stock at any point on our product

**00:29:22** page at Cotton Bureau, you can put your email in and you'll get a one-time notification for when

**00:29:27** we restock. But if you want to get to always know when there's restocks at the theme system.com,

**00:29:34** there is just an email newsletter that every time we have them go back in stock again, I send out an

**00:29:38** email to that newsletter to let people know. So depending on what your preference is, if you just

**00:29:43** want to get it one time or you want to know every time, they're your options. There'll be links in

**00:29:47** the show notes for both of those. A long way of actually, I will also put a link in the show notes

**00:29:52** to an episode of The Pen Addict, episode 441. If you are a pen and paper nerd and you would like

**00:29:59** to know in more detail the exact particulars of the journal, why I made the choices I made,

**00:30:05** which is like four levels down the stack of nerdiness, and I'm going to subject everybody

**00:30:10** to on this show. Me and Brad broke it down on that episode and we kind of went into all of like,

**00:30:15** why did I choose this grammage of paper over this grammage of paper? And what are the, you know,

**00:30:20** really like deep down, but if you're that type of person, that's out there for you.

**00:30:26** All right, should we talk about our yearly themes again? I always like to spend some time

**00:30:31** in the next episode after we set them, like after they've settled in a little bit,

**00:30:35** because I don't know about you, but I really feel like the first kind of 60 days of my yearly theme,

**00:30:41** there's like a lot of movement as it's kind of like sort of defying for me.

**00:30:46** Yeah, like I completely agree. And I think there's the additional effect for us about

**00:30:51** making it public and talking about it, you know, because again, I keep it a total secret, like,

**00:30:56** and I just talk to you about it on the show. And there's always this process of explaining

**00:31:01** something to someone helps clarify your own thoughts and also just having it out there

**00:31:07** can sharpen things up for you. So yeah, I'm very happy to revisit our themes in this early January.

**00:31:13** Taking a lot of voyages, yeah.

**00:31:19** Yeah, I will just say not to revisit our opening conversation, but very quickly,

**00:31:27** when we did record that first episode where I talked about Year of the Voyage,

**00:31:33** I did have it in my mind of like, my theme was almost boring of like, oh, my theme is

**00:31:41** I'm going to go outside sometimes. And this is almost boring to talk about because we were

**00:31:49** recording at I think perhaps to the day, my apex of optimism for the next year's worth of time.

**00:31:58** And I was like, oh, this whole coronavirus thing is getting wrapped up. And I almost had this

**00:32:05** weird thought of like, I might have picked a really bad theme that I would have to change

**00:32:11** because it just like, it wouldn't really be relevant in the next coming year. But boy, oh,

**00:32:18** boy, am I glad I went with Year of the Voyage because of like the two sides of the coin and

**00:32:26** like the flip side of Year of the Voyage is like what I was, what we were talking about before is

**00:32:31** like double down on spaceship U and have set reassessment points or like set dates that you're

**00:32:40** looking for and the events of the world conspired to give them to me. And I also like you,

**00:32:49** psychologically, I feel like I'm in a really good place because when Lockdown 2 was announced,

**00:32:56** I felt like, oh, okay, this is exactly what I had prepared for that the flip side of this theme is,

**00:33:04** this is not unexpected and you're going to continue with this process of like working at home in a very

**00:33:12** space deliberate way for set periods of time. And so I think if I had not done that, I think the

**00:33:20** psychological feeling could have been something along the lines of I was really optimistic that

**00:33:26** this was over and then it was all snatched away at the last second, which would not have been a

**00:33:32** great feeling. Again, I just feel very relieved about intentionally picking something that was

**00:33:39** quite flexible. As part of this, one of the things that I've done was after the Christmas break,

**00:33:45** I decided to do the thing that I have wanted to do for the entirety of this Lockdown period,

**00:33:52** but just never wanted to do at any particular time was a full and complete office Konmari.

**00:34:01** I went to my home office, I took everything out of that office, brought it all into the main room.

**00:34:10** This includes like in my home office, I also have a closet, which contains a lot of my personal stuff

**00:34:16** like clothing and additional equipment. It's like, bring it all out into the main room.

**00:34:22** And I just went through all of it, like deciding, okay, I am going to assume for the sake of this

**00:34:32** exercise that I will be working in my office for the next year at home with no other place to go.

**00:34:41** And like with that in mind, what do I need to keep? What makes sense to have in the office?

**00:34:48** And what doesn't make sense to have in the office? And as always with one of these like tidying

**00:34:53** sessions, it was just a really great thing to do. Like it had been on my mind for months and months,

**00:35:00** like it bothered me that I had too much stuff that was just unorganized in here. As you occasionally

**00:35:05** heard when I had to rummage through boxes to try to find like, oh, where's that cable? And I probably

**00:35:10** decrease the amount of storage space that I had by at least two thirds. I have a nice little box

**00:35:17** with all of my audio stuff in it. And it's like, ah, yes, this is the box that contains audio stuff.

**00:35:22** This is the box of all of the different wires and each type of wire is like in its own separate

**00:35:26** little bag. And here's the charging station for all the things. Like I kind of sort of had that

**00:35:33** stuff for most of the year, but I gave it a lot of really serious thoughts. And, you know, in the

**00:35:38** process of doing that, I also decided, okay, now that everything's out of the office, it's way

**00:35:44** easier for me to think about how do I want this to be set up, assuming that I'm going to be here

**00:35:50** for a year. And it was just, it was just really clarifying. And again, because of the theme

**00:35:59** is like, it didn't feel like a bad exercise. It felt like a good exercise. Also, when you bring

**00:36:04** everything out, it's way easier to move stuff around or like make brand new decisions. And so

**00:36:09** I've totally changed the layout of the two desks in my space. So I've kind of reversed my podcast

**00:36:17** slash writing station and the sound booth that I use around it and like how the microphone is

**00:36:24** oriented and all of this stuff from my initial tests say like, Oh, this is, this is a much better

**00:36:29** setup. Like there's way less noise that gets on the microphone works nicely in my office.

**00:36:34** I have a new treadmill for the treadmill desk that is much nicer than the one I used to have.

**00:36:41** I don't remember if we ever spoke about the treadmill desk.

**00:36:43** We did talk about the treadmill desk. I think you were annoyed because I hadn't mentioned it

**00:36:47** because I had had it for like months. And then it came up at some point. What I don't remember if

**00:36:53** we talked about is I did have a treadmill and then it like had a small electrical fire one day.

**00:36:59** And so I had to get rid of it. Oh, yeah. I can't, I don't think I mentioned that on the show, but

**00:37:09** no, you haven't told me this. I didn't know this. Yeah. So it's like a small electrical fire on a

**00:37:14** treadmill. Like what is that? Well, what's that all about? Uh, so I have to like, it's still the same

**00:37:22** case now, but in order to, so I'm sitting at the desk, which is normally my standing desk for

**00:37:28** writing where I have the treadmill. Now with the old treadmill, I had to physically unplug it

**00:37:34** from the wall and plug it back in and move it each time I wanted to do a podcast recording,

**00:37:38** which is like a big pain in the ass. But one of the times when I went to plug it back in,

**00:37:45** there was an extremely loud pop from right under the front where the motor was. And a little bit

**00:37:52** of light that I could see coming translucently through the top of the case and a lot of heat.

**00:38:00** And I grabbed my little fire extinguisher that I have in my office. Luckily I did not need to use

**00:38:07** it because I was just looking at it for a few minutes and then the light dimmed and the smell

**00:38:11** of horribly burnt plastic filled the room. And so, uh, that treadmill was no more. And I did not order

**00:38:18** a replacement of the same model of that treadmill. And I got a different one. Should I have a fire

**00:38:22** extinguisher in my office? Yeah, you should have a fire extinguisher in your office. You should

**00:38:25** totally have a fire extinguisher that is for electric fires. And this is the reason why.

**00:38:31** Well, I don't have a treadmill. Yeah, but I'm sure like me, you must have a million

**00:38:36** electrical equipment stuff. Yeah. Right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you know, again, if I,

**00:38:41** if I look under my desk right now, like the amount of things that are plugged into the extension

**00:38:47** cord, even if any of them individually are not likely to catch fire, like, you know, the extension

**00:38:52** cord itself is not a perfect piece of equipment and it has a lot of draw on it. So it's just a,

**00:38:58** like, it's just a really teeny tiny one. You know, it's not much bigger than two soda cans on top of

**00:39:03** each other and it's four electrical fires. And I keep it in my office. You know how I don't like

**00:39:07** Chi charging? We've been through this, right? Yes. Yes. Belkin made a Chi charger that was catching

**00:39:12** fire. I knew it was going to happen. I said it the whole time. Apple was selling this Belkin

**00:39:18** wireless charger and it started catching fire. I mean, when you say catching fire, is this the

**00:39:22** thing where people say catching fire and they mean shorting out or do they, you mean like flames?

**00:39:29** An issue with the power supply unit could cause the device to overheat and leave it vulnerable

**00:39:33** to catching fire or shocking people. That's what the product recall says. That sounds like

**00:39:38** possible fire, but still quite alarming. You know, it's like your treadmill only possibly

**00:39:42** call on fire, but I'm very certain it was on fire inside. And luckily it ran out of fire.

**00:39:49** How'd you know that was a fire? You know, I am counting the light of the smoke as fire.

**00:39:55** It could have just like, I don't know, I got really excited. Yeah. It definitely

**00:39:59** sounded like the treadmill call on fire. That's a, I don't like that. Yeah. Get yourself a small

**00:40:04** fire extinguisher for electrical fires. Yeah. No, I'm going to do that now. Yeah. Yeah. Definitely

**00:40:08** do that. So, but so like as part of the office rethink, like I got a treadmill that one disconnects

**00:40:16** without having to like physically plug it in each time. There's like a wire that I can disconnect in

**00:40:21** a different way. And also got a treadmill that quite nicely actually does fold up against the

**00:40:27** wall in a, in an easier way. So that like when I'm transitioning to podcast mode, it's a much

**00:40:33** simpler process than it was before, which is very nice. And also as part of this process,

**00:40:38** it got new storage shelves that are much nicer than the temporary stuff that I'd had before.

**00:40:44** So I took this, the start of the year as a time to take the year of the voyage brackets, like in

**00:40:54** spaceship U very seriously again, in the same way that I took it very seriously a year ago. And I

**00:41:01** was really happy to do that. And right now I feel the same way of like, Oh, thank goodness. Like I

**00:41:07** got rid of so much crap that I didn't need in my office. Everything that I do need is much more

**00:41:13** easily accessible. The storage spaces that I have now look much nicer. I also bought like

**00:41:21** 10 of these massive sunshine, led lamps to place all around the office. So it's like really bright

**00:41:30** inside, which is very nice. It must be like the surface of the sun in there.

**00:41:37** Yeah. But you, but you know, Mike, I have these massive sound absorbing panels that I build my

**00:41:42** little recording studio. They're like, it's like looking into the abyss, those things. Yes. Yeah.

**00:41:47** Those, those things are, are, are venti black, you know, perfect light absorbing stuff. So you

**00:41:53** need the power of several tiny suns to overcome them. But it's just one of those things. Like,

**00:41:59** again, thinking about it quite seriously and try and trying to go through what haven't I

**00:42:04** liked about my office in the past year. Yeah. That was one of the things that was high on the

**00:42:09** list. It's like, I can never get it bright enough that I'm happy with the situation. So I was like,

**00:42:15** okay, brightness is my problem. What do I need? LEDs that have 10,000 lumens. Great. Give me 10

**00:42:22** of them and I'll just pop them all over the place. And now it's, now it's really nice, especially

**00:42:27** with the blue walls. Like I couldn't possibly love it more. So that, that was like the main

**00:42:32** big project of working on redoing the office. And it took so much longer than I thought it would,

**00:42:38** but I'm really happy that I spent the time at the start of the year to do that.

**00:42:42** Yeah. I think that's really great. I would definitely say that I have not put that

**00:42:46** kind of effort in that you have like the amount of work I did was small for, for getting the

**00:42:50** office set up again. I could imagine wanting to do this if I didn't have a studio. Right. Like,

**00:42:57** at the moment, like Adina was asking me, like, if I wanted to get some new things for the home

**00:43:02** office, like she's like, Oh, like what about this? What about this? Would it make you feel more

**00:43:06** comfortable? And I'm kind of like, I kind of refuse to want to spend more money on the home

**00:43:10** office because I'm paying rent on a studio that I'm not going to. Right. So like, I'm like,

**00:43:17** I'm like resistant to it kind of like on a principle level. Yeah. I totally get that.

**00:43:22** Yeah. But I've, you know, what I have done is just make it so I've made enough space to not feel

**00:43:28** like I'm in this cave of an office, which is what I felt like previously, because it just felt like

**00:43:35** everything was, was, was like closing in around me being in here. So I have done some work,

**00:43:40** but I could imagine if I was in your position where like, look, maybe me like a year ago from

**00:43:46** now, where I was just assuming that I was going to be at home all the time, I could imagine doing

**00:43:51** what you have done, like really just going back to the beginning, ripping it out and starting

**00:43:55** all over again. And it's also easier to do that with the perspective of, okay, I have worked in

**00:44:01** this space for almost a year. Yeah. What have I liked and what have I not liked? Yeah. And

**00:44:06** just trying to get rid of the, you know, I like there was any major problem, but it was just a

**00:44:10** bunch of minor things, but a bunch of minor things do cause annoyance, like they add up together. And

**00:44:16** so I'm really happy to resolve it. But I agree, like in your situation, I wouldn't recommend the

**00:44:22** same course of action. Like taking the time I took to redo my home office wouldn't make sense

**00:44:26** for you to take that time to redo your home office. Like that, you know, they're just totally

**00:44:31** different situations. The plan is that this room doesn't have any office stuff in it. Like that was

**00:44:35** the plan. Right. That's the dream. That's the dream. Maybe, maybe 2021, I could do it. 2021.

**00:44:44** No home office for Mike. Maybe. Just one, one other little thing for my year of the voyage in

**00:44:53** spaceship U is also thinking back over the past year, the one station, the one station I have

**00:45:02** never been able to really get a good hold on, which has driven me crazy all last year, because

**00:45:08** it's normally not a problem has been sleep and it's, it's been like, I've just found it sort of

**00:45:16** fascinating, but last year I've just was never able to get into a consistent waking time. And

**00:45:28** I just found it shocking. Like I'm not this sort of person who sleeps in, but I've never in my whole

**00:45:35** life had more difficulty getting up at the time that I want to wake up than I have in the last

**00:45:41** year. And it's just been totally shocking on both ends of staying up later than I intend to,

**00:45:49** or like waking up in the middle of the night and being awake for a while and just sleeping in and

**00:45:56** not even consistently like waking up times keep moving by an hour in either direction.

**00:46:02** It's one of those things where it just sort of slowly happened and I was aware of it all last

**00:46:09** year. And I would talk to people sometimes about like, Oh, this is probably one of the biggest

**00:46:13** changes for me. Is this really this big frustration, but I could never quite get it to work. And

**00:46:20** I've decided like, okay, that's one of the specific topics for again, this year,

**00:46:28** if I'm going to at the start of the year, take it seriously and overestimate the time. It's like,

**00:46:35** I can't have another year of this, no matter what the deal is, no matter how hard it is,

**00:46:41** no matter how much my brain really doesn't want to get up when it's supposed to get up in the

**00:46:46** morning. Like I'm going to tackle this problem and, and get this sorted because this is probably like

**00:46:55** one of the bigger things that I want to accomplish under this lockdown situation that I want to be

**00:47:02** different from how it went last year. So yeah, that's probably the next thing on my like

**00:47:09** actionable items that are coming out of the theme reassessing at the beginning of the year.

**00:47:17** Yeah, my sleep patterns messed up big time.

**00:47:19** Okay. Can I ask you a question? Have you had really vivid dreams?

**00:47:28** Some. Yeah. What I'll say is for me with dreams, I don't dream very often, or at least I

**00:47:35** very rarely remember my dreams. Like I wake up and they gone. But I have had some dreams recently

**00:47:44** that have stuck with me a little bit more, which is abnormal. But I have heard this from a lot of

**00:47:50** friends are having what I would describe as COVID dreams, where it's like, I'm outside and I'm

**00:47:58** freaking out, right? Like I've been hearing a lot of that kind of stuff, which is like very clear,

**00:48:04** but I know this is what people do, right? Like they, you're influenced, it's your brain

**00:48:09** being influenced by what's around you and you're dreaming about it. But I would say that I'm

**00:48:14** I don't know if they're more vivid or not than other dreams, but I am having more dreams than

**00:48:20** I'm remembering than I normally do. Yeah, it's interesting. Like I've heard the same thing from

**00:48:27** other people. And it's, it's one of the reasons why I sort of rode off the sleep

**00:48:31** thing is like, Oh, something's just different about sleep and it'll sort itself out eventually.

**00:48:36** But yeah, it's, I don't know what the deal is. If, if anything, if I had to predict

**00:48:41** ahead of time, if someone said, Oh, you're going to spend a year in your house.

**00:48:46** Do you anticipate that the intensity and vividness of your dreams will increase or decrease in that

**00:48:53** environment? I would have bet a lot of money on decrease. Like, Oh, this is nothing. This is

**00:48:59** super boring. The number of times when I wake up now and feel like, Oh man, I was really busy last

**00:49:05** night. Like in my dreams is very high. And it's just interesting talking to other people. It does

**00:49:10** seem like that has not been a universal phenomenon, but a, they're fairly prevalent phenomenon. And I

**00:49:18** just kind of wonder what the deal is, but I've had enough of this. I think it's one of the things that

**00:49:23** you can see in hindsight. Like I would have agreed to you, like in, given this set of parameters,

**00:49:29** what would your dreams be like? It was like, well, you have no stimulus. So they would be boring,

**00:49:34** but it's the inverse. You have no stimulus. So your brain's like, Oh, what can I cook up? I am bored.

**00:49:41** Yeah. Yeah.

**00:52:00** and Relay FM. So how is your theme going in the beginning of the year? Pretty good. I think for me

**00:52:07** there isn't really too much to be achieved in the short term. Okay. But what I have enjoyed is

**00:52:17** keeping the idea of reinvention in my mind as I'm moving through life at the moment. And I think

**00:52:24** I've been able to kind of solidify some of my thinking around it a little bit more. So we've

**00:52:30** been watching Chef's Table on Netflix, which is just like multiple series TV show. We're going

**00:52:38** to tell you the life of a famous chef or a successful chef. And the main thing that I noticed

**00:52:45** from watching these shows is kind of this idea of a reinvention for these individuals. There is

**00:52:53** a formula like it was we were making a joke about it by getting to the end of the show.

**00:52:58** Like every chef would have some success and then they would have a thing that knocked them back

**00:53:05** and then they would come back and be bigger and better than ever. And the knockback for them

**00:53:11** could honestly, it wasn't necessarily that something terrible had happened. Like they failed,

**00:53:16** you know, like some of them like they have restaurant fail, but some of them would be like,

**00:53:21** I believe that I am making this kind of food, which is incredible and everyone loves it. And

**00:53:27** they're doing great. And then they meet some other famous chef and they're like, you're not

**00:53:31** your food's not doing what you think it's doing. You are making like an imitation of Mexican food,

**00:53:37** you're not actually respecting the ingredients. So then that person takes it to heart and then

**00:53:42** they go on like a vision quest throughout all of Mexico. And then they end up making the best

**00:53:46** Mexican food around, right? This is like a thing that plays out a lot in the show. And I've been,

**00:53:52** I was finding it very interesting watching it because it was like, you watch these people get

**00:53:56** really good at a thing, but they're always looking for the next thing that they're, they,

**00:54:01** they have the success, but they've always got their eye on, well, I've hit this now. So now what?

**00:54:08** And I really enjoy watching shows like this to see the creative process for people, like how

**00:54:14** they grow and express themselves. And I like a show that, that highlights how difficult this

**00:54:19** process can be for people, right? Of like wanting a next thing, a more thing. And this has helped me

**00:54:27** kind of like solidify another phrase that I'm baking into the year of reinvention, which is

**00:54:34** the phrase, the second act. Ooh, I like that. That's the thing that I see all these people going

**00:54:41** through. And I think it's where I am in my creative life. Like I've been looking at my last few years

**00:54:47** of themes, diversification, stabilization, refinement, and shift. Like these were the themes

**00:54:54** in kind of reverse order. And I think that this thing about what is my next thing has been

**00:55:02** something that's been bubbling up for a long time. Hmm. And I think for me, it's not that I feel like

**00:55:10** I need to start again, but it's that I am looking for another challenge. Hmm. And when I've been

**00:55:21** looking through my years of themes, there's been this element of it the whole time, like wanting

**00:55:26** to diversify myself and stabilize certain areas of my creative life, but also looking for new

**00:55:32** creative expression and fulfillment. And I'm, I think that it's circling around this idea.

**00:55:40** And so I think that reinvention for me for this year is really the culmination of work that I've

**00:55:50** been trying to do for a while. I cannot say that I will achieve this in 2021, but I think that I've

**00:55:58** finally gotten to kind of like the knife's edge of something that I've been skirting around for like

**00:56:05** four years, nearly. Hmm. And so kind of like finding other areas that I can find success in

**00:56:13** right now feels like something that's important to me. And with where I am right now, with like my

**00:56:21** spread of the things that I do, I think I'm potentially finding that in the work that we're

**00:56:28** doing, Cortex brand, like the idea that we are trying to build out of this, this like

**00:56:36** selection of products for people that are like us, it's interesting to me. And I find myself being

**00:56:44** very engaged with it mentally. Like I'm enjoying the problem solving aspect of it and the risks

**00:56:54** inherent to it. Like there is something in that which is very exciting and fulfilling.

**00:57:01** And I do feel like now we are getting to a point where, I don't know why I keep coming up with

**00:57:09** animal-based metaphors, but like grabbing the bull by the horns kind of thing is where we're

**00:57:14** getting closer to that point of like, all right, well, we just got to do this thing, you know,

**00:57:21** and it's an intimidating thing. But I think that that's kind of where I'm getting closest to of

**00:57:29** like, all right, so you've done this thing. You had a thing that you wanted to do, and you wanted to be

**00:57:35** a podcaster, that was your goal. And I have now spent more time doing this professionally than

**00:57:43** I ever wanted to do it. Right? So I feel I feel accomplished here. But I don't think that I would

**00:57:50** feel creatively fulfilled just doing the same thing for the next 35, 40 years. Like I want to

**00:57:57** do different things. And one of the main differences for myself now to how I've been over the last 10

**00:58:04** years is I don't feel like I have to leave anything behind. But I feel like I need to have a different

**00:58:12** mix. And I've been right, like, and I've been kind of circling around this for years. But it's like,

**00:58:20** okay, what is the next thing that Mike Hurley can do? Like, that's kind of where I am now. That's

**00:58:28** what reinvention is. That's what this idea of the second act is. And I think that maybe this year,

**00:58:38** I'm going to be able to make more significant steps in this than I have been in the previous few

**00:58:45** years, because now I feel like I've really hit it. So I've had a lot of clarification in my mind over

**00:58:52** the last few weeks. That's so interesting to hear, because since we spoke about it last time,

**00:58:58** I've thought about your theme several times. And I think it's because it's without a doubt,

**00:59:04** my favorite theme that you've done. Like hearing you talk about it, I've thought like, wow, Mike's

**00:59:11** really gotten something this year. And like, I like the way he was talking about it. And this

**00:59:16** today has really solidified for me, like, oh, why have I thought that like, oh, Mike picked for

**00:59:21** himself just like the perfect, just a great theme. This is the best theme he's picked for himself

**00:59:26** so far. And I think you're right. It's because you have been kind of swirling around these ideas

**00:59:30** for a while. And you've articulated it now. Like you said, reinvention is a thing that

**00:59:36** may take more than a single year to accomplish, but I really like that this is in your mind

**00:59:44** clearly. And I think the second act is a great additional phrase to have to try to clarify to

**00:59:52** yourself, like, oh, what do you mean by this? And like you said, it doesn't need to be something

**00:59:55** that's totally different. You don't need to lead something behind. And that's why the second act

**01:00:00** is just a great phrase, because it's like, that's what happens in a story. Like there is a

**01:00:04** continuation, but also there are new things that are different. And so I really like it.

**01:00:11** Because I feel like I've already entered my second act as a podcast creator. Like,

**01:00:16** I feel like I'm already there. Like I've done that, like in that part of my career,

**01:00:21** you know, like I'm very much in it now, you know, in multiple ways. Like one, just from going from

**01:00:28** like being a person trying to make it happen into being a person who part runs a company that does

**01:00:34** this. But then that then also another level of last year, being a person who is now creating

**01:00:43** content that I'm asking people to pay me directly for. Like that's like another part of this,

**01:00:50** right? Of like this, this like second act of me as a creator, where it's like,

**01:00:54** okay, I've had this stuff and it's free. And we support it with ads. And that's the business.

**01:01:01** Now I am also asking you like if you like the work that I do enough,

**01:01:06** that you want to support and get more of it. This is a thing that we can do. And like that,

**01:01:12** I feel like that is like a second act for me there as well. But now I'm like,

**01:01:17** all right, but this is all steel in the thing that you've been doing for a decade.

**01:01:22** Let's go up another level. You as a person of who has ambitions and creativity,

**01:01:32** you need to look at something else, a completely different field, right? Can you make it work in

**01:01:40** something that is completely unlike everything that you're doing? Not an adaptation, right?

**01:01:46** Not like a little shift here or there, a different step into a different type of podcast content,

**01:01:52** we're talking like different business. And so we have been moving towards this for a while,

**01:02:02** but I feel like it's an area that now I've kind of like, I've made it like, I've approached like

**01:02:10** a fork in the road and I think I know where we're going. I know you like to build traditions into

**01:02:16** the Cortex calendar. Yeah. Are you going to give us the traditional mic time tracking report? Yes.

**01:02:24** And I've made it better this year. There's a chart. I've made a chart. So I've provided

**01:02:32** this in the show notes for you and for our listeners. It's my- Oh, wow. You're really

**01:02:36** getting fancy. I know. So like previous years, I've just included screenshots. And then today I

**01:02:41** thought, wouldn't it be nicer if rather than you going between one or the other to compare them,

**01:02:46** I can just create a chart for you to show how things have changed year over year.

**01:02:51** Oh, I really like this. This is great. The state of mic. I like it.

**01:02:55** I know. There's one thing, look, before we dive into any particulars here, there's just,

**01:03:00** there's like a massive element and a room that needs to be addressed to these statistics.

**01:03:05** So in 2019, I tracked 918 hours of work. In 2020, I tracked 1,506.

**01:03:12** Ah, that's quite a difference. Why?

**01:03:14** It's a massive difference. Well, there's a bunch of reasons. So there's small reasons and there's

**01:03:21** big reasons. I didn't travel, right? When I traveled, I didn't time track.

**01:03:25** Ah, okay.

**01:03:26** But that doesn't equate for a 600 hour difference.

**01:03:30** No. And looking at the charts, there's nothing on here that's obviously a 600 hour difference either.

**01:03:38** No. The difference is I worked a lot more in 2020. I mean, we knew that. I've spoken about that.

**01:03:48** Right.

**01:03:48** Everything is up across the board and that has just added to a 600 hour difference.

**01:03:57** How do you feel about that?

**01:03:59** I feel terrible about it.

**01:04:01** Okay.

**01:04:02** Because I didn't feel like in 2019, I had all this time to spare.

**01:04:09** Right?

**01:04:09** You mean if we had talked to 2019 Mike and said, oh, hey, could you increase these hours by what,

**01:04:18** like 40%? Like he wouldn't have responded. Oh yeah, there's tons of slack in the schedule for that.

**01:04:25** Yeah. Like I would have been like, no, I don't think I want to do that. Thanks.

**01:04:31** But you know, I've spoken about this, right? I spoke about it on our last episode. I think

**01:04:36** maybe even a little bit on the one before it was, I feel like mostly unavoidable requirement this

**01:04:42** year. More was needed. You know, there are new entrants on this list. There are entrants that

**01:04:50** saw a huge change in them. It is what it is. I don't, I couldn't tell you what 2021 is going

**01:04:57** to look like.

**01:04:58** Yeah. That's what I was going to ask is what is your prediction for 2021? Given that I think if

**01:05:05** we asked current you, do you think you have say 40% more slack in the schedule to give?

**01:05:12** I think you're going to answer no to that.

**01:05:14** No, I can tell you categorically, I don't. I think 2019 Mike would have said he didn't want to.

**01:05:22** Ah, okay.

**01:05:23** Right. But I think, you know, I could have found it. I don't have that kind of

**01:05:29** amount of hours in May. I would expect my prediction now is that 2021, the number will

**01:05:37** be in between these.

**01:05:38** How do you feel about that?

**01:05:40** I'm fine with it for now. Because I think it's continued to be what is needed. And also that

**01:05:46** there are just some things that won't change. So some of the clearer differences are in show

**01:05:53** prep podcast editing and podcast recording. Right. So they're the biggest bars and those

**01:06:00** biggest bars have gotten bigger. One of the reasons for that is my shows that take the most

**01:06:06** time now take more time to make. Does that make sense?

**01:06:10** I feel like Cortex doesn't fit in that category. Right. Or are you including all of the additional

**01:06:18** stuff for the membership? Like, is that what you mean by like all of the shows across the board?

**01:06:23** Correct.

**01:06:23** You're including the membership because you have an additional category on here,

**01:06:28** which is membership, but you're not tracking the show extras.

**01:06:32** Right. That is administration of membership.

**01:06:36** Right. That's okay. And so I also expect that that number will be vastly lower now because like

**01:06:43** most of the what 60 hours in that was in getting the new system off the ground.

**01:06:49** Okay.

**01:06:49** I don't do the ongoing maintenance of the membership program that that's Steven's part

**01:06:55** of the business. But when we were starting off with our new system, I was much more involved

**01:07:01** in that and helping them. We were talking about it more meeting about it, more of that kind of

**01:07:07** stuff. Okay. That makes sense.

**01:07:09** So I expect that that number will go down a lot, but the membership content for my shows is included

**01:07:16** in podcast editing, podcast recording, and show prep.

**01:07:19** Okay. All right. That makes more sense. I don't know why. Just the way it was worded on the chart,

**01:07:23** I assumed membership included everything you were doing for the membership, which included the

**01:07:28** additional content editing, which in retrospect is crazy. Like that obviously shouldn't have been

**01:07:33** the case, but I can see why you, why someone would think it, right? And like, this is one of those

**01:07:38** things like everyone's time tracking set up base or like even their productivity set up basically

**01:07:43** only makes sense to them. Right. Because it's what makes sense to your brain and everybody else is

**01:07:49** completely different. But that, so that, that also then puts you in a more difficult position

**01:07:54** for getting back to say sub a thousand hours of, of tracked work, because yeah,

**01:08:01** like there's things on here also like mega studio, I expect we'll have not so much of a bar next year

**01:08:08** for the time that was put into it. Like that's a one-time investment along with the membership

**01:08:13** admin. But yeah, so, so you've, you've signed yourself up for, and it, it visually looks like,

**01:08:22** I don't know, what would you say? Like 20, 25% extra work across the board for all podcasts

**01:08:28** with the membership program now as part of them? Would you say that's about right?

**01:08:32** Yeah. I'm fine with it because the membership program has been a success.

**01:08:38** Okay. So you think that's a sensible increase in time per unit of recuperation from that?

**01:08:45** Yes. Okay. I'm just, I'm, I feel very suddenly aware of looking at these charts of bigger numbers

**01:08:53** in the context of reinvention. Like, like I'm just thinking of Mike needs reinvention time. And,

**01:09:01** and so that's, that's just what, that's just sort of what's on my mind here. It's like, oh, okay.

**01:09:05** You have signed yourself up for more work across the board for podcasting and just, and just trying

**01:09:12** to think about like other projects for you, where, where are they going to go or where are

**01:09:16** you going to find, find time for it? I mean, it's going to ultimately, I mean, I guess mean that I

**01:09:22** have to make tougher decisions in some areas. And that's just going to have to be a thing that I

**01:09:28** need to deal with if and when, I mean, for all I know, like, you know, a lot of, a lot of the

**01:09:36** growth in time has also been in like establishing new processes to handle the production.

**01:09:42** Like it took me a while to really get my head around what is the most efficient way to produce

**01:09:51** this second version of the show. And I am getting way faster at that now. Okay. It's just from like a,

**01:09:58** a management level, right? Like I'm dealing with two versions of the editing project, two files,

**01:10:06** two parts of our publishing system, right? And getting that system down took me a while. And I

**01:10:15** know I'm getting faster at it, but like what I can never get away from is it will always take more

**01:10:22** time to prepare the shows. If there's more content, it will always take more time to record them and

**01:10:26** it will always take more time to edit them. And that's, that's fine for right now. That's fine.

**01:10:32** I just need to see how it shakes out in the long term.

**01:10:34** What do you think about your time spent on the, on the one-off things on this, on this list? Like,

**01:10:40** I'm looking at this, this mega studio. And I'm also looking at the things that have

**01:10:44** massively increased like streaming. Yeah. Streaming was nothing in 2019. And it's a,

**01:10:51** it's a much bigger thing in 2020. So how do you feel about those things that exist,

**01:10:55** which didn't before, there's a funny one here, which is also events, which is dramatically

**01:11:02** increased in 2020. Yeah. Yeah. Well, what I'm wondering is like, where would have been the

**01:11:09** WWDC on 2019, like that went away, but you know, events has gone up. So, so I'm just like, I'm kind

**01:11:17** of curious about these ones in particular where BAM, there's, there's stuff in 2020, which

**01:11:23** basically didn't exist in 2019. Yeah. Yeah. I know. I was waiting for events. I was waiting to see

**01:11:30** if you pick up on that one. Cause it doesn't make sense. Does it? Right? No, there were no events

**01:11:35** in 2020. I assumed events is like the podcast-a-thon. Like that's what I was assuming that was.

**01:11:41** That is exactly what it is. Okay. This is one of the ones hit by travel. So my 2019 events would

**01:11:48** have been massive, but I don't track when I travel. Okay. But I was tracking the podcast-a-thon

**01:11:54** stuff cause I was at home for it all, but I also was tracking like the planning of it differently.

**01:11:59** I think I would have honestly, the thing was that we spent a lot more time on the 2020 event than the

**01:12:04** 2019 event. Right. Because not only did we have to plan it, we had to plan it all over again, right?

**01:12:10** Right. When all the plans changed. So live shows and all that kind of stuff,

**01:12:16** I didn't really track that kind of those really in 2019 because I was, I was handling all of that

**01:12:23** while I was mostly not at home, right? When I was not working at home. So that was,

**01:12:28** that is a thing which is large, uh, 63 hours and that's all of the planning and then the execution

**01:12:34** of the event. And I also had to do a lot of like getting the environment ready. Like all of that

**01:12:40** stuff may not be in the 2021 thing. I don't know. Streaming for me is, I mean, I track it as work

**01:12:48** because I feel like it's time that should be tracked, but it's like, it's a hobby. It's how

**01:12:53** it feels. Okay. So it's in my work tracking, but it doesn't feel like work at all. So that going up

**01:13:02** will improve my mental health. So what's your reasoning for tracking it if it's, if it feels

**01:13:10** so different? I just want the data on that. Okay. Because like when I come to look at this list,

**01:13:17** it makes me happy to see those numbers there. Cause I know that like that makes me feel good.

**01:13:22** So I like to see that I'm putting more time in it. Okay. That makes, that makes sense. It makes me

**01:13:27** happy. It's a perfectly valid reason. I like that. Mentorship is a new one on there. I don't think

**01:13:32** this is the thing I've actually spoken about all on the show. I don't even know if it's something

**01:13:36** that me and you have spoken about. I started a mentorship program back in like May or something

**01:13:42** like that. It was where I'm working with a group of people that wanted that are trying to get their

**01:13:49** kind of start in podcasting. So this is a thing that I've been doing mostly on a monthly basis.

**01:13:55** And it's a thing that I look to continue to do into the future. It takes a lot of time to make

**01:14:00** something work like this. And I feel like it's something that I need to continue getting better

**01:14:05** out as a person leading a group like this. But that's the thing that didn't exist before. And

**01:14:09** it's the thing that's going to continue from there. And again, is like, is it work? Like the rest of my

**01:14:16** stuff is not really, but it feels related enough. And I want to get those numbers in there. I want

**01:14:21** to see what I'm spending time on it. So like there's something that didn't exist before.

**01:14:25** Can you explain to me more about the mentorship one? I feel like I don't have a good understanding

**01:14:31** of why did you pick up this project? Okay. And what is it for? So this is a program that I created

**01:14:39** kind of in like May or June of last year to work with people who are underrepresented in the type

**01:14:48** of podcasting that I do, which is mostly technology shows, but in my kind of area, effectively like

**01:14:58** conversations. They're like talking shows, right? Yeah. I can't really help people that want to make

**01:15:03** shows that are really heavily produced. Like they have music in them and sound like they belong on

**01:15:09** American public radio. But there are lots of people that want to do the types of shows that we make,

**01:15:16** but want to get a head start when I get a hand and I have experience and can share it with people. And

**01:15:21** I put out a call on social media and I had lots of people apply. Like I had like a,

**01:15:26** an application system and I work with a group of like nine or 10 people and we are in constant

**01:15:34** communication. We have like a private group, a discord group actually, not Slack. A discord group.

**01:15:40** Yeah. That's the way to go. Yeah. And we meet on a monthly basis where I give what I've like jokingly

**01:15:46** dubbed in the group, like little lectures about a certain topic. Like I'll pick a thing and we'll

**01:15:51** talk about it and we'll answer questions about it. And then in the in between times, I help

**01:15:57** these people out with questions that they have about trying to get their project started.

**01:16:01** That's really interesting. That's really interesting. And yeah, I don't, I don't think you've,

**01:16:05** you've mentioned a peep about this to me all year. Like I can't believe that you've,

**01:16:09** you've like kept this secret from me this whole time. Well, I think it was one of those things

**01:16:15** where I meant to mention it to you and then didn't. And then it was like, is this something

**01:16:20** that you'll just never find out about because you don't use social media? And the answer is yes.

**01:16:26** And then it's funnier this way. Yeah. I've been working on this project for about six or seven

**01:16:32** months. Yeah. We've had like six or seven zoom calls with the group. And it's really, it's been

**01:16:37** really interesting to have this stuff to share with people. And it feels like it's like a, it's

**01:16:43** a lot of responsibility, you know, cause you kind of go into these things and you're like,

**01:16:50** I feel like I have stuff to say, like, am I actually helping these people? Right. And it's

**01:16:56** something that like, you know, I've tried to keep small because going into it, I had no idea

**01:17:03** how much time it would take to help people go, go through this kind of process. But, you know, I,

**01:17:08** I kind of feel like that there is an element of like, you've, you've, you've got to kind of be

**01:17:13** the change you want to see in the world. And it felt like to me, the right thing for me to do.

**01:17:22** It was something I wanted to do to, to help people out that wanted help.

**01:17:27** You're doing like group calls with everybody at once. That's what you're doing.

**01:17:30** Yes. We have a group call once a month. And so that's, that's when you're giving the mic lecture.

**01:17:35** Yeah. That's when the lectures begin. And then you're the professor of podcasting is what you

**01:17:41** are. I guess so. That's what you're doing in those situations. That is, that is high stakes,

**01:17:46** like honest to God, looking, looking at your prep time. Like I can't believe you're able to do what

**01:17:51** you said six or seven zoom calls. Like I would be so nervous having to be the professor of podcasting.

**01:17:59** It was, it's, it was man. I was like, before the first one, like sick with nerves.

**01:18:06** Oh, I bet.

**01:18:08** And that's honestly like one of the reasons they became what I refer to them as like lectures

**01:18:13** is because when I get nervous like this, I just can't stop talking. So I went into the first one,

**01:18:20** expecting to have more of a conversation, but I just couldn't stop myself talking.

**01:18:25** And then over the following ones, it became more of a conversation. But I do go, I mean,

**01:18:31** I go into them with like, I have this information that I want to give to you. So I will talk through

**01:18:37** everything that I prepared. And then we can have a conversation about it. And that sense would have

**01:18:41** been like the way that I have felt comfortable in giving this information out is like, I have all

**01:18:46** this stuff locked away in my brain. I will share it with you. And then hopefully that will spark

**01:18:52** a conversation or dialogue.

**01:18:54** It does feel like a very different thing to add into the list. Like, yeah, it's related to the

**01:19:01** fact that you've been a podcaster for 10 years, but it's a, it's not a new project. Like it's a

**01:19:07** new podcast. It's a totally different thing. And like preparing even little lectures or trying to

**01:19:14** like prep what topic do you want to talk about ahead of time? Like, yeah, that's, that's, that's

**01:19:19** no joke. So congratulations on getting that done. And I, and, and also for keeping it from me for

**01:19:26** all of this time, sneaky, sneaky Mike.

**01:19:32** I've kept the secret.

**01:19:33** You never know what a Mike's up to. He's doing sneaky, sneaky things.

**01:21:21** Make your next move, make your next website. I asked on the cortex with her account for

**01:21:28** people to send in some questions for us for yearly themes focused to ask cortex. In case

**01:21:34** there are people I know that maybe starting off on their yearly theme journey or have heard the

**01:21:39** episode, maybe it's their first yearly themes episode and they're still trying to get their

**01:21:43** head around the yearly theme that they want to approach for the year. So got a lot of great

**01:21:48** questions and I thought we could maybe tackle some of them before we finish the show today.

**01:21:53** First one comes from Chris. What do you think about having several themes and what do you

**01:21:59** think about stacking themes? Stacking themes? Yeah, the way I saw this was like having themes

**01:22:07** that overlap. Okay. I mean, like stacking seems fine if that's what that means overlapping. Yeah.

**01:22:14** I feel like I am in a terrible place to make a comment about what do you think about having

**01:22:19** several themes this year? Because like I have the theme where it's a coin and there's two sides and

**01:22:25** but each side also has the long and short part of it. Like I'm in this weird position where I've

**01:22:31** got like four things going on at once. I think it's maybe better in this instance for us to look

**01:22:36** into our past, right? Because we've both had years that have had multiple themes in them.

**01:22:40** Yeah. Yeah. I would say like in general, the newer you are to themes, the stronger I would advise

**01:22:53** towards one rather than several or the, you know, the thing that we've also talked about like

**01:23:01** sub themes, which is, which is more like an idea that relates to the main idea. But I mean, I don't

**01:23:08** know how you feel about it, Mike, but I would be cautious about having two that are not related

**01:23:16** to each other. That's sort of my thought about this. Yeah. I think if you're going to have

**01:23:21** multiple things that ideally should be some kind of relation to them. Otherwise it's a real pro

**01:23:26** move. You've got to be, you've got to be experienced of yearly themes to try and want

**01:23:31** to hold two of them at the same time. Yeah. And, and, and even with that, like I'm, I'm cautious to

**01:23:37** even say like, Oh, it's a pro move. Like, Oh, when you reach seventh, Dan and themes, you'll be able

**01:23:42** to tackle two at once. I'm just, I'm a little suspicious because I do think that there is some

**01:23:48** advantage to your brain kind of can't keep two things going on in the background in this way

**01:23:56** that themes are. I just feel like the very light touchness of themes is beneficial for there to be

**01:24:03** like one. So I'm just cautious about the several themes idea.

**01:24:09** Marcia asks, how much writing do you do about your themes? We hear your thoughts about it,

**01:24:14** but how much do you write down? How much gets put into your journals?

**01:24:19** I feel like you're the person to, to go for this one, Mike.

**01:24:21** Yeah. So when I'm coming up with my theme, I write a lot about it. I'm getting a lot of thoughts out

**01:24:29** and trying to really express everything. I will then distill it. So one of the ways that I distill

**01:24:36** it is talking to you about it, right? When I bring all of my thoughts to the show, it helps me kind

**01:24:43** of process them. And then what actually goes in my journal is a distilled version of it. So kind

**01:24:49** of the theme is summed up in a couple of sentences. And then I will have like six bullet points as

**01:24:54** like, these are the things that ladder up under that. So I think that there is a lot of benefit

**01:24:59** in doing both, like really trying to get everything written down somewhere. And then you review it and

**01:25:05** try and distill it down to some digestible phrases that connect that I then write into

**01:25:13** my theme system journal. So you like, yeah, the theme system journal for you is the primary

**01:25:18** point. Yeah. It's interesting because like, I think for me, if we're talking about

**01:25:26** where is it most often for me at top of mind is in my OmniFocus, I often have a like

**01:25:34** a folder which has the theme name and I'll sometimes put projects in there. So this is

**01:25:40** one of the place where depending on how actionable it is, I do try to sort out projects by, oh, this

**01:25:47** is a year of clarity project or this is a year of less project. Or I'll also just have reminders

**01:25:53** pop up for me in OmniFocus as like, this is an item to think about because this is what you want

**01:26:00** to have your mind focused on for like this particular theme. And they can be, this is a little

**01:26:09** dumb one, but it sort of relates to the like, it's partly clarity is where it originally came from.

**01:26:15** And it's also related to the spaceship you stuff. But so when I'm looking at my to do list, there's

**01:26:22** a little item at the top, which it's not a to do, but it just says inside before outside. And the

**01:26:31** idea that that's trying to remind me of is like, okay, you need to do your core work of writing and

**01:26:40** research, which is like internally generated before you start doing anything that's related

**01:26:47** to the outside world. And so is that a to do item? No, it's not a to do item at all, but it's,

**01:26:55** it's like a distillation of an idea that if you do this in the reverse order, if you try to look

**01:27:01** at the outside stuff, go on the internet, look at things. I'm even cautiously including some kinds

**01:27:08** of research in this is like external thoughts. If you try to do the outside stuff before the inside,

**01:27:13** it's like it never goes as well during the day. So this is like a point to follow. So I put some

**01:27:20** of those things on my own task list. The second thing for me, which is a little different this

**01:27:26** year that I'm trying to do as part of the year of the voyage is my journal use has always been,

**01:27:34** I think what I've called tactical in the past, just like my tactical coffee, nuclear weapons

**01:27:41** for going to conferences. My journal use has always been, okay, I'm on a graycation or there's

**01:27:47** a specific period of time. And it's like, I'm going to use the journal as a super focusing tool

**01:27:55** for these three weeks and themes can be involved then. But what I'm trying to do

**01:28:03** with the year of the voyage is like, again, thinking about it over the course of a year,

**01:28:11** I'm trying to extend this tactical use to a significantly longer timeframe. And so I am doing

**01:28:20** the daily journaling and daily themes with the idea that this is going to be over the course of

**01:28:28** the year. And in my brain, this is the dumbest thing, but it is totally helps and has made it

**01:28:35** consistent so far since the start of the year is transitioning it from like, Oh, it's a journal.

**01:28:41** And I know that I tactically journal, but now this is a completely different concept. I have to

**01:28:48** enter the ship's log every day because I am completing this voyage over the course of a year.

**01:28:54** And it's not a question about, am I tactically using this thing? It's just, no, part of your job

**01:29:01** as captain of spaceship, you is like, you've got to fill out this ship log. And it has some questions

**01:29:07** about how well have you done on these various things. So this is my mental reframing and attempt

**01:29:15** to make it like just a daily thing that becomes a kind of non-optional daily thing in the same way

**01:29:23** that I was successfully able to turn exercise into a non-optional daily thing. It's like, yeah,

**01:29:29** yeah, tactical journal use, it's been great. It has been literally life-changing, but if I'm

**01:29:36** expecting and planning for this upcoming year to be like another year of spaceship U, this is an

**01:29:46** element that is going to be part of that for the upcoming year. So those are, those are my thoughts

**01:29:52** on it. Basically use a journal or have it somewhere else that it, you know, you're going to be looking

**01:29:58** at it recurrently. BK asks, how do you find words that speak to you? My theme for 2021 is year of

**01:30:07** later becomes never. This is an attempt to reduce procrastination, but it's a bit wordy. It is a bit

**01:30:13** wordy. It's totally a bit wordy. You can't really rally yourself around a phrase like that, I think.

**01:30:17** Yeah, year of later becomes never is not great. It's like, you know, there's a rule for naming

**01:30:25** dogs, which is that you want a name that you're comfortable yelling loudly across a park. You know,

**01:30:31** like if you wouldn't yell a name loudly across a park, it's not a good dog name. I feel like themes

**01:30:38** are a bit like you should be able to yell it as a battle cry is the same kind of thing. And so I

**01:30:45** look at something like year of later becomes never, I would translate that into something like

**01:30:51** action, right? Year of action is, is way more like battle cryy than year of later becomes never.

**01:30:58** Now I think later becomes never is an excellent little phrase. Like if you were journaling or

**01:31:06** you're writing out what you're thinking about the theme that can reinforce, like what do you mean by

**01:31:12** action? It's part of the description. Yeah. Like you've had the second act, right? Like that's a

**01:31:18** phrase that kind of clarifies for you. What do you mean by this? So, I mean, the answer to how do you

**01:31:25** find words that speak for you is, I think this is part of the question of like, how do you find a

**01:31:35** theme is you just have to have something in your mind. It's like, okay, you know, I'm trying to

**01:31:43** think about reducing procrastination and you just sort of have to sit with it for a while. I think

**01:31:50** it has to just brew in your mind for a little while and you just kind of, something will come

**01:32:03** to you that is more concise if you keep thinking about it, but you don't need to have a, like a

**01:32:10** deadline for yourself of, Oh, you know, I want to start the journaling system right now. And so I

**01:32:17** need a name of a theme. It's like, no, no, it's okay. You can just have this on your mind and you

**01:32:22** can start working out like, what are you trying to do? And I think in that process, you'll find

**01:32:30** something that speaks to you that is more concise. But I think that the action point here,

**01:32:37** or the actionable point here is that a concise title does not need to be fully descriptive.

**01:32:45** So don't fall into that trap. I think if you've listened to Mike and I talk about our own themes,

**01:32:51** it's why we need an episode and a half for both of us to fully explain what do we mean

**01:32:59** by these couple word phrases.

**01:33:01** The question from Thomas, I set my theme based on some goals I already had, then added more goals

**01:33:07** once I set the theme. Am I doing this wrong? Or is thinking about what you want to accomplish first

**01:33:13** a good strategy? This is exactly what I did this year though. Like I, okay, there have been years

**01:33:19** where I've had the word or the idea before I've had the things that come from it. And then there

**01:33:25** have been other years where I've had a selection of things. And then when I look at them all

**01:33:29** together, I realize a common theme. So I don't think it's necessarily wrong. I would say it does

**01:33:38** tend to help with an overriding idea. But sometimes if you just get all of your thoughts out there,

**01:33:43** you can see there's a connection between them and then that can become the theme. I think that

**01:33:47** that's a perfectly valid way of starting this process, especially if you're new to it, I think.

**01:33:54** Yeah, it's a funny question. I wasn't actually really sure how to think about it at first, but

**01:33:59** I mean, I guess in some ways I'm doing the same thing. I feel like I don't have very many explicit

**01:34:07** goals, but the themes often are the result of a question like, what is it that I'm trying to

**01:34:15** accomplish over the next year? Which is another way of saying like, what is it that I want to do?

**01:34:21** Or actually, I do have an explicit example of this, which is that this year and last year,

**01:34:28** there has been an internal like my company theme and that has been very explicitly like,

**01:34:36** here are the goals, what is the word to describe these goals? So for my company, like totally,

**01:34:42** that's the way it's been done of like, goals, goals, goals, what's the word to describe these

**01:34:47** goals? So then yes, I think that is a totally fine way to do it. You're not doing it backwards

**01:34:53** or wrong. Adam asks, well, Adam has an opening statement before the question, but it's important

**01:34:58** for it. I'm continuing my year of health. I started getting in shape in mid 2020, thanks to

**01:35:04** Cortex and themes, down 30 pounds for the first time of years, and I've held a consistent workout

**01:35:09** routine and I'm eating better. Congratulations. Yeah, congratulations. If that is what you were

**01:35:13** like, this is clearly what you're going for and I hope that you're happy with the progress that

**01:35:18** you've had. Like a lot of it is like eating better, feeling better is the most important part.

**01:35:24** The question is when or how do you guys consider a theme to be done? What do you think about that,

**01:35:29** Mike? Sometimes I just change over because the year is a new year, right? You know, it's done

**01:35:37** because it's time to record your theme episode of the podcast. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. But

**01:35:42** there are, you know, there are things that I bring along with it if there's something that I feel

**01:35:47** like I haven't completed yet, you know, so like I will adapt something maybe understand what needs

**01:35:53** to be achieved format and move it forward. Straight up, there have been things where I was like,

**01:35:59** I didn't do that. I was trying to do it for a year and I didn't do it. So I'm leaving it. Like,

**01:36:05** I'm going to leave this thing behind now. It was part of my yearly theme. It did not get achieved.

**01:36:12** If it was something that I had in my mind for an entire year and I couldn't make it happen,

**01:36:16** then I'm going to let it go. This is maybe not a thing for me right now.

**01:36:21** But at the same time, if you've had a year and you're happy with the progress that you've made,

**01:36:26** but you still want to continue working on it, keep it going. There was what was it year of order

**01:36:33** two? That was something you did once, I think. Or was it me or something? I don't remember.

**01:36:42** It was year of order and year of reorder.

**01:36:44** So what was there was one there was there was a thing that you had which had a comma in it

**01:36:48** at one point. Look, I have this commas, there's parentheses, there's, you know, two sides. There's

**01:36:54** there's always like a catch, right? That's that's the way it works. I think even the very first one,

**01:36:59** which was the year of less, it was like year of less brackets me. There's always something like

**01:37:03** right from that was it. It was it was year of less comma me. I think that was the

**01:37:08** one. Yeah, I think my thought on this is if you have had a theme and it hasn't panned out for a year,

**01:37:18** like you feel like it hasn't worked well, probably it's better to think about it in a different way.

**01:37:26** And like I'm the person who didn't do that with year of order and year reorder with I think mixed

**01:37:34** success out of the two of those. So I think there's a way in which like if the theme isn't

**01:37:39** working for you for more than a year, I would say don't keep pushing that rock up that hill.

**01:37:45** Like that's not a great idea. But I'm with Mike that if if something is going well, there's no

**01:37:50** reason to cut it short. I would put it this way. It's like a theme is done when you find yourself

**01:37:59** thinking about the next one. And I think that is that is likely to occur when the current one

**01:38:07** either just no longer applies because you have changed or the situation has changed,

**01:38:12** or it has simply become part of your thinking. Like I think about the themes a lot at these

**01:38:19** decision points. It is a tool to help focus the way that you make decisions. How are you going

**01:38:27** to spend your time? What are you going to do in this moment? And it can just become a background

**01:38:34** part of you like it did for me with year of less where it's just a natural thought for me now

**01:38:40** always like, do I need to be the person who does this thing? And I don't need to

**01:38:47** constantly think about that anymore. It's just built into the way I make decisions. So

**01:38:54** I think when you find yourself thinking about what the next one is going to be,

**01:39:01** that's a sign that the theme is over. I guess I don't like the phrase done because done is

**01:39:11** the kind of language you would use with a goal or a target or a resolution. Yes, or a resolution.

**01:39:17** Excellent, Mike. Yeah. That's like, why am I having such a hard time with this question? That's what

**01:39:22** it is. It's like, I don't like the language of done. Done implies like a completed state and

**01:39:29** themes are more of these background processes, high level general navigation stuff. So they're

**01:39:39** useful while they are useful. They're not completed states. I want to share a selection of some of the

**01:39:49** themes that were sent into us as the opportunity to help inspire people who may be looking for

**01:39:58** something for themselves for this year. Blake says, I'm a week into my first yearly theme,

**01:40:05** the year of intention. Intention is such a popular one. I feel like every year I see a lot of people

**01:40:10** talking about this. I'm hoping to use this year to turn off my autopilot and be more intentional

**01:40:15** and thoughtful with what I eat, how I spend my time, what I purchase, what I own, and the words

**01:40:20** I choose and how they affect others. Yeah. I always love that one. I think I've mentioned it

**01:40:24** in years past, but I do feel like intentionality is just a great starter theme. Yeah. It touches

**01:40:32** on everything. It makes you think about your life. It doesn't have to be towards trying to specifically

**01:40:39** accomplish anything. I always love intentionality as a theme, but perhaps that is because I am

**01:40:46** always fighting the war on intentionality and tracking my unintentional time. So I love that

**01:40:52** one. I'll always love year of intention or intentionality as a theme. I think year of

**01:40:56** intention and year of less, like start a pack. If you're struggling and one of those two,

**01:41:04** pay attention to what you're doing or do less of what you're doing. They're really great starters.

**01:41:10** Brian is doing the year of discomfort. Growth doesn't happen when you're comfortable and I'm

**01:41:15** going to stop avoiding situations that scare me. No bones about it. This is more dark, I think,

**01:41:23** than yearly themes tend to be, but I actually really liked it. It's not dark at all. That's

**01:41:28** a very actionable one, right? That's a great clear decisions. A word like discomfort is not

**01:41:36** typically the type of word that we see in yearly themes, but I very much like it. I think there's

**01:41:45** a lot of interesting stuff in there, but it is definitely in sound different to the type of

**01:41:52** thing that we would normally see, right? Yeah. Okay. I get what you mean. I like it because

**01:41:57** when you've talked about themes being North stars, what this immediately makes me think of is a book

**01:42:03** I know I've mentioned in passing on the podcast, which is the war of art, which is talking about

**01:42:08** the creative process and how you can use your own resistance to doing something as the compass that

**01:42:18** points toward what should you be doing. So I really like year of discomfort because it has that same

**01:42:28** attribute of, you know, when you're feeling discomfort, so it can really highlight,

**01:42:36** is this a moment when you want to try to grow and push out of your comfort zone because you're not

**01:42:42** going to not know when you are uncomfortable. And, and like, so I really, I really like that one.

**01:42:47** I like that one a lot. Brandon, my yearly theme is year of the muscle rather than starting new

**01:42:53** things like hobbies or activities. I'm working out muscles. I currently have physically, mentally

**01:42:58** and getting better at my existing hobbies. Oh, interesting. That's not where I was expecting

**01:43:03** it to go from your neither was I, which is why I included it because I loved it. Cause it was,

**01:43:07** it really threw me. I was like, Oh, Brandon wants to get swole this year. It's like, Oh, yeah.

**01:43:13** Maybe that's part of Brandon's focus, but that isn't all it is.

**01:43:17** I like that. That's a nice twist on your muscle.

**01:43:22** Nigella says my yearly theme is one focus on becoming proficient at one thing at a time.

**01:43:29** I have lots of new stuff being thrown at me this year and focusing on one tool.

**01:43:32** One method is helping me do my job and keep my sanity.

**01:43:37** Oh yeah. That's, that's another great one. I like that. I like that a lot.

**01:43:42** Don't do too many things at once.

**01:43:43** Also is something I struggle with too many things at once. Year of one is a, is a good,

**01:43:50** good theme. I like it a lot.

**01:43:51** Grave says 2021 is my year of connectivity. Quarantine and lockdown caused me to not reach

**01:43:57** out to friends and family as much, but I'd like to reconnect and make more connections in a safe

**01:44:01** way. As I move into the workforce. Also another theme that I think perhaps very many people can,

**01:44:07** can feel like might be a, might be a nice thing to do this year.

**01:44:11** Yeah. It's definitely a 2021 thing, that one. Yeah.

**01:44:14** Marianne is working on the year of balance. Too much stress on social media, too much bad food,

**01:44:20** too much TV. I want to consider other thoughts, add in a few constructive activities and allow

**01:44:24** for more calming walks rather than 10 K run or nothing attitudes.

**01:44:30** That's a really good way to put it. Yeah. Chill walks versus 10 K all or nothing.

**01:44:33** Yeah. I like that. I like that.

**01:44:35** Yeah. I like that phrase too. Cause it's like, allow yourself to do some calm stuff rather than

**01:44:40** like, if this isn't perfect, I'm not even going to bother.

**01:44:42** Mmm. Yeah, that's good.

**01:44:45** And Lewis says my theme for 2021 is the year of novelization. Firstly, and most importantly,

**01:44:52** I want 2021 to be the year I finally finish writing a novel, but I also want to try branching

**01:44:58** out into new creative directions, maybe trying streaming or making other game videos.

**01:45:03** That's interesting. I think it's a little more like

**01:45:07** actiony and goalie than I'd like themes to be, but you know what? People have the novel inside of

**01:45:15** them and we can all be the authors of our own lives. So good luck to everyone with your themes in 2021.
