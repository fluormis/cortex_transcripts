# Cortex - 137: A Barometer of Twitter
**00:00:00** OK, I'm all set.

**00:00:01** Oh, let me just grab something.

**00:00:02** We'll correct one second.

**00:00:03** No rush.

**00:00:05** All right.

**00:00:06** What'd you grab?

**00:00:07** Vanilla Coke.

**00:00:08** Oh, sorry.

**00:00:09** I just realized I need to grab something.

**00:00:10** Hold on.

**00:00:11** Ha ha ha ha.

**00:00:15** OK.

**00:00:16** What did you grab?

**00:00:17** I grabbed a vanilla hule.

**00:00:19** Oh, that's the food thing, right?

**00:00:21** Yeah, the meal replacement thing.

**00:00:23** I was getting ready.

**00:00:24** I forgot to grab something.

**00:00:25** I knew it was something.

**00:00:25** And then it's like, oh, vanilla, thank you

**00:00:27** for triggering it in my brain.

**00:00:28** What do you think of vanilla hule?

**00:00:30** It's the best hule.

**00:00:31** OK, but are we grading on a curve here?

**00:00:33** It's not as good as a vanilla shake,

**00:00:35** if that's what you're asking.

**00:00:36** Yeah.

**00:00:36** It tastes vanilla.

**00:00:38** It is a totally adequate meal replacement.

**00:00:41** Is there a competitor?

**00:00:42** I forget the other one.

**00:00:43** It was like a?

**00:00:44** Soylent.

**00:00:44** Soylent, yes.

**00:00:46** It's definitely better than Soylent, I would say.

**00:00:48** And I think there's some weird thing with Soylent not

**00:00:50** being able to be sold in the UK anymore.

**00:00:53** It seems like hule is everywhere and Soylent has disappeared.

**00:00:56** Is this one of the ones I can't have?

**00:00:58** Is it full of nuts?

**00:01:00** Is it full of nuts?

**00:01:02** I don't know.

**00:01:04** Just like with Soylent, I feel like the really unfortunate

**00:01:08** names is like Soylent.

**00:01:09** What's Soylent made out of?

**00:01:10** People.

**00:01:11** Yeah.

**00:01:11** It's like hule.

**00:01:12** What's hule?

**00:01:13** Human fuel.

**00:01:13** Human fuel.

**00:01:14** It's made of humans.

**00:01:15** It's made of humans.

**00:01:16** Like, guys, why are you picking these names?

**00:01:18** These are terrible names.

**00:01:20** Like, looking at their website, it doesn't say it's got nuts in it,

**00:01:24** but they might have nuts in it.

**00:01:26** How are you with peas?

**00:01:27** Are peas OK?

**00:01:28** I don't know.

**00:01:29** Yeah, yeah.

**00:01:29** Peas are great.

**00:01:30** Peas are awesome.

**00:01:31** It says on here, like just an image.

**00:01:33** I don't know.

**00:01:33** It's just an image.

**00:01:35** Tapioca, sunflower seeds, coconut, pea protein, flax seed,

**00:01:39** and hemp seed protein.

**00:01:40** I think I should be good at that.

**00:01:42** Yeah, I'm not seeing anything on the one

**00:01:43** that I'm drinking that looks like nuts.

**00:01:46** Did Soylent have a lot of nuts?

**00:01:47** No, but a lot of like protein bars.

**00:01:51** It's all nuts.

**00:01:52** It's just all nuts.

**00:01:53** No matter what it tells you the flavor is, right?

**00:01:55** It's like chocolate chip, but like 70% peanuts.

**00:02:00** It's always funny to me when I see like chocolate chip and then like peanut

**00:02:03** chocolate chip.

**00:02:04** It's always peanut anyway.

**00:02:06** So look at it, you know?

**00:02:08** But I found, I don't remember, but years ago, like I found a company

**00:02:12** that that was their thing.

**00:02:14** Like we make protein bars without nuts in them.

**00:02:18** So the hue, all right, does it fill you up?

**00:02:20** It totally acts as a meal replacement.

**00:02:23** I think the biggest disadvantage is it's higher in carbs than I would like.

**00:02:28** 26 carbohydrates per individual little drink.

**00:02:32** It's a bit high on the carb side if you're trying to do something that's

**00:02:36** keto to have more than one in a day.

**00:02:39** But this is, shall we say, transitioning out of holiday eating mode.

**00:02:44** I have never eaten so much during the holiday break before.

**00:02:47** So we build a gingerbread house.

**00:02:49** And you know, and I build a gingerbread house every year.

**00:02:51** I basically ate the entire gingerbread house, which is like not a thing that I do.

**00:02:55** Wow.

**00:02:56** Usually it's like it's there and then we'll eat a little bit of it and it's gone.

**00:03:00** But like over the course of like a week, I ate most of the gingerbread house.

**00:03:05** Cause it was just like in the kitchen and like every time I walked past it, I was

**00:03:08** like, well, I have another piece of gingerbread house.

**00:03:10** Like I was like Godzilla walking around the kitchen.

**00:03:14** The poor villagers must have been terrified of me.

**00:03:17** Well, I'm glad you were enjoying yourself.

**00:03:20** That's very much the like Thanksgiving to New Year's season.

**00:03:23** It's like, well, when can I physically not eat anymore?

**00:03:27** Again, like I would love for the carbs to be like half of what they currently have.

**00:03:32** But compared to eating gigantic bowls of pasta for dinner, it's very, you know, it's

**00:03:38** like, oh, we're already way ahead.

**00:03:40** It's like, oh, how many, how many carbs per meal?

**00:03:43** Three weeks ago, I don't know.

**00:03:44** A hundred, 200 carbs per meal.

**00:03:47** I was like, okay.

**00:03:48** So 26 is a great improvement.

**00:03:50** I like to make a recommendation for you for like a thing that I like, which is kind

**00:03:54** of in this vein.

**00:03:56** It's a cereal called magic spoon.

**00:03:59** Magic spoon.

**00:04:00** Okay.

**00:04:00** Yeah, they do.

**00:04:02** It's great.

**00:04:02** What I like about magic spoon is they do cereal that is like kids cereal for adults.

**00:04:10** No sugar, low carbs, high protein.

**00:04:13** I'll investigate it.

**00:04:14** And genuinely it's really good.

**00:04:16** Now, like all of these things, it has like something weird about it.

**00:04:20** Like it's got like a little chalkiness to it sometimes, but the flavors are great.

**00:04:25** And of all of the stuff that I've tried, which is like all of this for me is lunch

**00:04:31** replacement.

**00:04:32** That's always what I'm looking for because lunch is the most dangerous meal of the day

**00:04:36** for me, for sure.

**00:04:38** And magic spoon has been my favorite of these that I've found.

**00:04:41** I might try these who all things.

**00:04:43** I might get one of their sampler packs and give it a go because this would be the perfect

**00:04:47** kind of thing for me to have in the studio.

**00:04:49** I have a little fridge in the studio, right?

**00:04:51** And I could just stock these up and maybe a couple of days a week.

**00:04:54** This is my lunch or whatever.

**00:04:57** Yeah.

**00:04:57** If you're looking for a lunch replacement for that, I highly recommend it.

**00:05:01** Okay.

**00:05:02** What I don't like about these kinds of things is like, why is it version 1.0,

**00:05:06** version 2.0?

**00:05:06** I'm just going to speculate that gives you some insight into the background of the

**00:05:13** founders of the company.

**00:05:15** That's what that comes from.

**00:05:16** Like, oh, they probably came from tech slash software.

**00:05:19** All right.

**00:05:20** I'm going to take a look.

**00:05:21** Yeah.

**00:05:21** No, this is, this is all part of the rollover from the theme of like, oh, there's two

**00:05:24** parts.

**00:05:25** And one of them is work on your health.

**00:05:27** And this is definitely the like work on your health.

**00:05:29** Like let's transition out of just terrible holiday eating and like so far, so good.

**00:05:34** How is your theme going?

**00:05:37** Uh, it's probably worth setting the stage, by the way, that we set our themes eight

**00:05:42** weeks ago by the time we're recording.

**00:05:44** Yeah.

**00:05:45** So like I have been living the year of the weekend for two months, even though it's

**00:05:50** January.

**00:05:51** I was pausing there for a second when you asked me because we do have this very

**00:05:54** strange time delay between when we last spoke and especially because we recorded

**00:05:59** the theme episode earlier this year.

**00:06:01** Way in advance.

**00:06:02** Way in advance.

**00:06:03** We recorded it like before I went on vacation in November.

**00:06:07** It was recorded a really long time ago because we wanted to make sure it was done.

**00:06:12** I didn't want to record it on vacation again this time.

**00:06:14** Like I did in 2022, the beginning of 2022.

**00:06:19** Yeah.

**00:06:19** That was, that was the day where you were going to Disney after we were done.

**00:06:22** I hated that.

**00:06:23** Right.

**00:06:23** Like I was nervous.

**00:06:25** It was way too much stress.

**00:06:27** I was like, no, no, no, we will never do this again.

**00:06:29** Like, so we just can't live with the pressure that like Mike has to go to

**00:06:33** Disney.

**00:06:33** So like we need to fit it.

**00:06:34** Like I was awful.

**00:06:35** I was like, I can't delay that man going to Disney.

**00:06:37** That was, that was just, it was a bad idea.

**00:06:39** Cause then I was like, it was on my mind that I had to edit and I started editing

**00:06:43** on in the airport on the way.

**00:06:45** It was just like a bad, bad time.

**00:06:46** So like this time, and I think we'll always do this, get it done before the

**00:06:50** holidays for us, it's just a case of like planning.

**00:06:54** So like we're still running our themes for 12 months, but they're from like

**00:06:57** November to November rather than January to January or whatever, you know?

**00:07:01** Yeah.

**00:07:01** Yeah.

**00:07:01** I think also part of the reason I was kind of hesitating is, is I feel like

**00:07:05** ideally December slash January, some period in there is like a vague

**00:07:13** transition from the previous year to the next year.

**00:07:17** And that's how I feel like it's gone for me is it's a bit like, Oh, we did record

**00:07:22** forever ago, but I feel like mostly I've actually just started with the theme

**00:07:29** stuff two weeks ago, cause I was in a kind of transition period, sort of a

**00:07:33** good way to finish the last year slash also start the year of work was I ended

**00:07:40** up doing a writing retreat.

**00:07:42** I'm fortunate enough to be invited to these things sometimes.

**00:07:44** And so those are always just like incredibly successful work periods.

**00:07:49** You're there with other people.

**00:07:51** You're focused on one thing.

**00:07:53** Everybody just ends up talking about whatever they're working on.

**00:07:56** And you sort of keep an eye on everybody else of like, Hey, what are you doing over

**00:08:01** there?

**00:08:01** Shouldn't you be working and not just sitting around?

**00:08:04** So there's really great, really focused period of time.

**00:08:07** Just like gentle bullying.

**00:08:08** Yeah, it is.

**00:08:09** It's like friendly work bullying.

**00:08:11** But it's, it's good though.

**00:08:12** Yeah.

**00:08:13** Like, I liked that.

**00:08:14** Something that was different this year, which ended up being a great idea was

**00:08:17** that we were all kind of, you know, like I always talk about in units of like doing

**00:08:21** units of work kind of got everybody to be centrally tracking like units of work done

**00:08:27** per day, basically right above the coffee machine, which is where everybody was going

**00:08:31** all the time.

**00:08:32** So that was also like a very nice, gentle pressure on everybody is like you could see

**00:08:36** where other people were in their day towards finishing, however many units of work they

**00:08:41** wanted to get done.

**00:08:42** It was also a nice test of some of this stuff that I'd been thinking about how I want to

**00:08:47** pick and select topics.

**00:08:50** Some of the things I was working on were correctly constrained in terms of like how big

**00:08:54** can this project get or like how many things am I working on at once?

**00:08:58** So it was it was really good.

**00:08:59** And that's why like that trip really felt like a big transition.

**00:09:03** It's like that was partly last year, but it was also the beginning of this year.

**00:09:06** The people on these writing retreats, are they all YouTubers or are they across different

**00:09:10** fields?

**00:09:10** It's different fields.

**00:09:11** Not everybody's a YouTuber.

**00:09:13** I think that's good.

**00:09:13** Yeah.

**00:09:14** Yeah.

**00:09:14** I think that makes the most sense or something like that.

**00:09:16** If you can get a mix of professions.

**00:09:18** Yeah.

**00:09:19** The trick to those things working well is it matters that everybody does the same kind of

**00:09:25** thing, but it doesn't matter that you're doing it in the same medium.

**00:09:30** Writing is writing, right?

**00:09:31** Whether you're writing a YouTube video or a TV show or a movie or a book, like you're still

**00:09:36** writing.

**00:09:37** When I get invited to these things, I do try to say yes, they always end up being just very

**00:09:41** productive periods of time.

**00:09:42** But they're also just incredibly draining because you can't maintain like the 10 days of just

**00:09:48** constant focus on the one thing at this high level for forever.

**00:09:52** But that's why it was it was nicely planned right before my Christmas break and flying home.

**00:09:59** The whole airport was like a plague zone.

**00:10:02** I don't know what was going on this year, but coming through that airport, I felt like I was in a

**00:10:07** horror film.

**00:10:07** Everywhere I listened, it was like coughs and sneezes.

**00:10:11** It's like flumageddon, man.

**00:10:12** It's been like this holiday season seems to have been a bit of a nightmare.

**00:10:16** I feel pretty fortunate that I have escaped any kind of like even just sniffles because just it

**00:10:22** feels like everyone's sick with something.

**00:10:25** Yeah, it was it was real bad.

**00:10:29** And I was in the airport of like, I'm not getting out of here alive.

**00:10:32** It's no way.

**00:10:33** And sure enough, I go 24 hours after getting home, I was like terribly sick for a couple of weeks

**00:10:39** with like a low grade flu, which I'm choosing to interpret as a final last thing from 2022.

**00:10:44** And that like closes the book on the terrible year of health.

**00:10:48** It's like a one final thing is Christmas and New Year's was kind of very low key from being super

**00:10:55** sick.

**00:10:55** But yeah, so that aside, I'm pretty happy because I've been slow to getting back into work.

**00:11:01** But I've been now that the holidays are officially over and I'm back to regular normal health.

**00:11:06** I've been sort of pushing hard on the like work on your health part of the theme.

**00:11:12** And that's partly why I was drinking the fuel now.

**00:11:14** It's like already lost a bunch of weight.

**00:11:16** I've been back into doing regular exercises, put on some muscle.

**00:11:21** And so like so far, it's actually quite a good start to the year.

**00:11:25** And I'm going to now like now that that has gotten started, going to slowly start ramping up the

**00:11:30** work side of things as well.

**00:11:31** So that's kind of my main report from the theme.

**00:11:34** But oh, actually, when a little thing happened, which made me kind of think about how I think it's

**00:11:39** really good to have a theme to help guide your decisions.

**00:11:44** And I just had a moment happen a couple of hours before we started recording, which is that I got

**00:11:50** an invitation to a conference.

**00:11:52** And it's funny because it's a conference that I had I had constantly been encouraging the runners up

**00:11:59** to be like, hey, you guys need to do that again.

**00:12:02** That was great.

**00:12:02** And let me know if you're ever thinking of doing it again.

**00:12:05** And so today I got that email like, hey, we're going to do it again.

**00:12:08** And for a moment, I was like, oh, man, I really want to go to this thing.

**00:12:12** And I felt kind of conflicted.

**00:12:14** But that like the theme came into my mind and it was like, hey, is this going to materially help

**00:12:19** you with the theme of year of work?

**00:12:22** Or is this actually going to be a hindrance in the year of work?

**00:12:26** And in that framing, it's like, man, this decision is a no brainer.

**00:12:30** Sure, I've been wanting to go to this thing for years, but it just doesn't make sense.

**00:12:34** And it actually becomes really easy to make that decision of like, oh, I'm going to have to turn

**00:12:39** down this invitation like I'm very sorry.

**00:12:41** But yeah, so I don't know.

**00:12:42** I felt like the theme has already saved me some time sort of going forward and making some

**00:12:47** decisions much easier about now you have to turn down more invitations than you did last year.

**00:12:53** You have to limit the amount of travel.

**00:12:54** And so, yeah, this is this is the theme helping to guide decisions.

**00:12:58** I'm still not going to say no to all invitations.

**00:13:01** I was I was trying to think of like a rough rule.

**00:13:04** And I think my rule might be something like if I have to change time zones, that's probably like a

**00:13:12** near automatic no with the slight asterisk of if it can work out that I can stay on grey

**00:13:18** master time while moving.

**00:13:20** Like maybe that's still a yes.

**00:13:21** But yeah, so anyway, that's how I'm just thinking about stuff as the year started.

**00:13:25** It is funny where it's like, you should do this again.

**00:13:27** You should do this again.

**00:13:28** Come on, you should do it again.

**00:13:29** Okay.

**00:13:29** Well, I'm not coming.

**00:13:31** I know you should do it.

**00:13:35** Like I genuinely feel bad about that.

**00:13:38** I'm sure I've even said words like, oh, if you do this again, I guarantee that I will go.

**00:13:42** Right.

**00:13:43** It is like, oh, this episode of Cortex is brought to you by issue.

**00:16:15** How's your theme going so far, Mike?

**00:16:17** You know what? Very happy.

**00:16:18** I feel like I have so far picked the perfect theme for me this year.

**00:16:23** Oh, yeah.

**00:16:23** Well, one thing that happened, I guess,

**00:16:26** since we last recorded is I suffered two injuries, which is I mean, really,

**00:16:30** I look at it as kind of hilarious and injuries are not hilarious.

**00:16:34** Well, I mean, it's like one of those things where you look back and it's just

**00:16:37** like I can't believe this happened to me kind of thing.

**00:16:39** It's retroactively hilarious.

**00:16:41** I sprained my ankle pretty bad a couple

**00:16:42** of days before we took that vacation that I was talking about,

**00:16:45** which was very upsetting because it felt like that was finally my reward for what

**00:16:50** was overall a very bad year.

**00:16:53** And that just added on to it.

**00:16:55** But through the help of my wife and a mindset change and thinking about weekend,

**00:17:00** I had the best vacation I've ever had.

**00:17:03** Oh, fantastic.

**00:17:04** Because I ended up prioritizing relaxation and recovery.

**00:17:10** Oh, good. Good.

**00:17:12** And so we just basically did really nothing.

**00:17:15** Just like really just relaxed, enjoyed ourselves, you know,

**00:17:18** sat by the pool, a good food, like that kind of thing, which is it was

**00:17:21** so needed and so wonderful.

**00:17:24** So that felt really good.

**00:17:25** Then because of the ankle sprain, I wasn't working out.

**00:17:29** And then I think that weakened and exacerbated an existing injury that I have

**00:17:34** in my back because I went back to the gym and immediately threw my back out

**00:17:38** like three days before Christmas, which is which is the thing I'm still dealing

**00:17:42** with now and I think is going to be around for a while.

**00:17:46** But in these situations, they are very frustrating.

**00:17:50** But the idea of the year of weekend is about like rest is like a big element of it.

**00:17:57** And so this mindset is helping me take the rest that I needed in certain areas

**00:18:05** to pull me through emotionally to very frustrating things that have occurred.

**00:18:09** So that was like just good to have that in my mind.

**00:18:13** So I was honestly very happy about when we

**00:18:14** recorded that episode because it was like it was like two days before I did.

**00:18:19** I ended up spraying in my ankle.

**00:18:20** But me and you were texting over the break a bit because I had found out you

**00:18:24** were sick and you had found out about my back through our wives.

**00:18:29** And I think I text you on Christmas Day and said, like, I feel bad for you.

**00:18:33** But at least it's like one last thing into 2022 about being sick before 23 starts.

**00:18:39** Right.

**00:18:39** That's what we were talking about, which is just kind of like a funny way to look

**00:18:42** at it, just just tuck it all in to 2022 and forget about it.

**00:18:47** Yeah. Yeah. It all counts as 2022.

**00:18:49** And now that's the past.

**00:18:51** That's the past.

**00:18:52** The past doesn't exist.

**00:18:53** The past isn't real.

**00:18:54** So it's, you know, away it went on to 2023.

**00:18:59** So my fitness for 2023 is going to change a little bit as I'm now like having to

**00:19:04** think about the midterm of the back recovery.

**00:19:09** And I've seen a specialist and gone through that whole thing.

**00:19:12** And, you know, that's just the thing I'm now going to have to start dealing with

**00:19:16** again, which is fine. I've done it before I work on it.

**00:19:19** But I've already started making lots of decisions about the way that I'm spending

**00:19:24** time and it's lots of small decisions that I think add up to bigger effect.

**00:19:29** So, you know, one is I leave for the studio a little later in the morning.

**00:19:33** A lot of this is about getting rid of kind of like wasting time.

**00:19:38** You know, so like even if it is the case of just like I stay home and hang out,

**00:19:42** I stay home, play video game, like but just there being more time at home,

**00:19:46** less time at work and kind of like further trying to separate those things

**00:19:50** and create that structure. And then similarly, when I'm done for the day,

**00:19:55** leaving, like not just like hanging around and finding other little things to do.

**00:20:00** And this is also in conjunction with scheduling changes and trying to group

**00:20:06** more things together.

**00:20:08** So it's less of one thing at the studio days.

**00:20:13** You know, I've got one thing I'll make sure that I've got something else coming up.

**00:20:17** I'm also going to slot it in that day.

**00:20:19** Not perfect on this yet.

**00:20:20** And it's going to take work persistence and difficult decisions.

**00:20:24** They're going to be things that I'll turn down or I will need to be difficult with

**00:20:29** people, that kind of thing. And one of the things that I'm starting

**00:20:33** to realize and I'm working through is like most of the people that I work with,

**00:20:39** the difficulty can be harder on me because of time.

**00:20:44** An afternoon recording for one of my

**00:20:47** American co-host is an evening recording for me.

**00:20:49** Yeah. And that is harder for me than it would be if I could record it in the afternoon.

**00:20:54** Right. So I'm needing to kind of try and be real with myself about some of the

**00:20:58** things that I'm taking on, that it is more difficult and I don't like working

**00:21:03** late anymore. So like this is part of why I'm needing to be a little bit more tricky

**00:21:08** about some of the things that I'm saying yes to.

**00:21:11** You know, the key of the year of the weekend is taking weekends.

**00:21:15** And I have been making very conscious choices about how I spend them.

**00:21:19** Like I have a task and to do list every Thursday.

**00:21:22** That's like, what's your weekend?

**00:21:24** Do you have a full Saturday and Sunday?

**00:21:27** Are you going to be working on one of those days?

**00:21:29** If you are, what will you be doing next week to make up for that time?

**00:21:33** That's been really good because it's just making me think about it.

**00:21:36** And the whole thinking about it thing is like the mindset change has been really

**00:21:40** great. So I'm valuing my rest time more,

**00:21:43** considering it as a important thing because it is part of my themes.

**00:21:47** Like I should be doing this.

**00:21:48** This is the year of the weekend. Right.

**00:21:51** Right. Like this is the same mindset as with

**00:21:53** the year of structure where it was about having structure to allow for unstructured

**00:21:58** time. So like playing video games instead of just like hanging out at my desk and

**00:22:04** not really doing anything was a good thing.

**00:22:06** And that reframing was great for me.

**00:22:09** And this is a similar thing.

**00:22:10** Not working on the weekend is what I'm supposed to be doing.

**00:22:15** So it's a tick in the column where previously it had been,

**00:22:18** oh, I should probably get some work done if I'm just going to be hanging out.

**00:22:23** So it's like rearranged for me.

**00:22:25** It's like rearranging what's most important.

**00:22:27** So that's been good.

**00:22:28** So, yeah, I've been I've been pretty I've been feeling pretty good about it.

**00:22:33** I'm excited for the rest of the year under this kind of banner.

**00:22:36** But I'm aware that kind of like you, it's going to take a lot of decision making all

**00:22:41** the time to make it stick. But yeah, I'm happy with the results so far.

**00:22:46** One thing I've added to my little checklist, which I don't know if this works for you

**00:22:50** because we do have these weirdly aligned themes just in opposite ways.

**00:22:55** But the day before one of my weekend days, I've added a little checklist item now,

**00:23:01** which is just to think about what the weekend might be tomorrow.

**00:23:06** This is to try to increase the probability of the wife outside time.

**00:23:11** If we think about it the day before, what we might do,

**00:23:15** it wildly increases the chance of thing actually happens on day.

**00:23:20** Interesting.

**00:23:21** So already we've we've gone out more so far than we have in the past,

**00:23:26** just with weekends of thinking about, OK,

**00:23:30** what might be a thing that we do that counts as outside time?

**00:23:34** And it's also funny, I know, like when I

**00:23:36** mentioned sometimes about like time tracking with my wife and like wife outside

**00:23:40** time, people always want to know, they're like, what is your wife think about that?

**00:23:44** And I'll tell you, she loves the idea of wife outside time.

**00:23:48** She's totally thrilled and on board with like, oh, hey, how can we make this timer

**00:23:52** tick up? Right.

**00:23:53** So I think sometimes people have actually like, oh, God, that sounds so horrible.

**00:23:57** But it's it's actually it's the reverse is a way to express importance from from my

**00:24:02** perspective of like, no, this is important.

**00:24:05** I should look at the timer and see that this timer has been going up relative to

**00:24:09** other things. But yeah, so like, how do you turn that into an actionable item?

**00:24:14** And this is one of my little things is just like just on the checklist.

**00:24:17** Just think about it for a second.

**00:24:19** And even just that gentle reminder makes it way more likely like, oh, OK, we know

**00:24:23** we're going to go outside today to some place or even just like, oh, there's some

**00:24:26** couple errand that we need to run. Let's just do that tomorrow.

**00:24:29** And instead of instead of what can very easily happen on the weekends, like you

**00:24:33** just kind of wake up and the day slowly slides past from both of you.

**00:24:39** That's the attempt to try to decrease the number of times that occurs.

**00:24:42** Yeah, I think I could maybe add this into my Thursday thing is a little bit sooner.

**00:24:46** But like, you know, not just like, are you taking the weekend?

**00:24:50** But what are you going to do with it?

**00:24:51** Yeah, I find that framing is somehow more

**00:24:54** helpful than just like, oh, it's the weekends.

**00:24:58** It is that framing of like, what might happen tomorrow or what do you plan on

**00:25:02** having happen tomorrow?

**00:25:03** At least so far slightly changes it in my brain.

**00:25:05** As with all this stuff, with like health stuff and everything else, it is always

**00:25:08** kind of easier in the beginning of the year.

**00:25:10** But it's just a question of like, OK, what works and what can stick and what helps

**00:25:13** remind you of different things.

**00:25:15** Do you have any idea of the kinds of things that you want to do with your

**00:25:17** weekends this year?

**00:25:19** Well, I mean, there is the house stuff, right?

**00:25:21** So like that's oh, God, the house projects are part of it.

**00:25:25** But also a year, I think for me, especially on the non weekend weekend days,

**00:25:32** I think would be good times to arrange activities with friends, especially those

**00:25:37** friends I have that have more flexible working times, which I do.

**00:25:41** But even then, it's like because one of my biggest issues is for my friends that

**00:25:46** have regular jobs here, they do nine to fives.

**00:25:50** I never have evenings free.

**00:25:52** So like if we want to go out and get a drink or a meal or whatever, I'm always

**00:25:56** I can't do it. And like so that's something else I've been thinking about.

**00:25:59** And these days I'm taking as weekend days.

**00:26:01** It's not just the regular daytime.

**00:26:04** It also means that evening could be free as well.

**00:26:07** So this is something that I this is going to take a lot of work

**00:26:11** and focus from me on like doing this.

**00:26:14** And I want to be for, you know, in a lot of my friend situations,

**00:26:18** someone who is pushing and like making the plans happen.

**00:26:25** But that's something I'm not naturally good at.

**00:26:27** So that is a muscle I need to strengthen.

**00:26:30** Yeah, I have I have no ability to help you there.

**00:26:35** Well, it's why me and you so seldom see each other is because we are both very bad at this.

**00:26:40** Yeah, we're really bad at this.

**00:26:42** But so your idea is you want to try to be more proactive about that for like you be

**00:26:46** the person who causes things to happen. That's the hope.

**00:26:49** Yeah. I don't know if this is really true,

**00:26:51** but I do have the perception that a lot of social groups exist because there is

**00:26:55** just one person who is the person who makes the thing happen.

**00:26:59** Yeah. That often really seems to be the case.

**00:27:01** Like there's a person who is the driving person behind each little social group.

**00:27:06** If you have any tips and tricks in that area, do let me know.

**00:27:10** For being a friend.

**00:27:12** Yeah, for being a friend.

**00:27:13** You know, I'll let you know.

**00:27:15** I'll let you know.

**00:27:19** I've got a bunch of follow up.

**00:27:20** Lot of little things have been happening.

**00:27:23** It's been two months.

**00:27:23** Of course, there's going to be a lot to talk about.

**00:27:25** Lots of little things.

**00:27:26** And I want to talk to you about them.

**00:27:28** One is got an awesome new Roomba.

**00:27:29** Ooh, new Roomba.

**00:27:30** Yeah. It's like the Roomba of my dreams.

**00:27:32** OK, let me check it out.

**00:27:34** It's called the Roomba combo.

**00:27:35** Roomba combo.

**00:27:37** OK. It vacuums and mops.

**00:27:40** Oh, intriguing.

**00:27:42** Now it is not as advanced as they're like because I robot,

**00:27:47** the Roomba company have a mopping robot, which I don't know if you've seen.

**00:27:51** It's like a full on sprays water out, cleans up after itself.

**00:27:56** Like this, the Roomba combo has a mopping pad that follows the Roomba.

**00:28:02** Basically like it's behind it as it's moving around.

**00:28:06** But it has liquid in it.

**00:28:08** So the Roomba will vacuum.

**00:28:10** But as it's moving forward, leaves a trail of liquid behind it and then mops it up

**00:28:15** afterwards and you can put like a cleaning solution in it.

**00:28:18** But what makes this Roomba combo so good?

**00:28:22** And I was watching some reviews of these things.

**00:28:24** There's a great YouTube channel called I think it's called Vacuum Wars.

**00:28:29** It's so good.

**00:28:30** My friend Tom, like Thomas Studio Neat turned me on to this.

**00:28:33** It's like it is an incredible YouTube channel.

**00:28:35** The guy just reviews all the vacuums.

**00:28:39** It's just like very good.

**00:28:40** As always, like my first reaction is like, how can that possibly be?

**00:28:43** And then it's like, ah, the pen show, right?

**00:28:46** Every everything is a world unto itself.

**00:28:48** I mean, Vacuum Wars has two hundred sixty six thousand subscribers

**00:28:54** and gets between ten to two hundred thousand views on videos because it's like.

**00:28:58** I love it. I love this is the person who knows all the vacuums.

**00:29:02** Like they have all these testing environments that they set up, right?

**00:29:05** Like they have these boxes and he sprays different types of like food down

**00:29:09** and like watches. It's very good.

**00:29:11** But the Roomba combo, one of the things that makes the Roomba combo good,

**00:29:16** because there are other robots that do this like joint thing,

**00:29:19** is the mopping pad can be lifted and lowered

**00:29:25** for when there's carpets or rugs.

**00:29:27** And this is combined with great.

**00:29:30** I don't know how old your Roomba is now.

**00:29:32** My Roomba is pretty old.

**00:29:33** My Roomba is like five years old or whatever.

**00:29:35** Yeah, my Roomba is due for a soul transfer soon.

**00:29:38** So I've got my I've got my eye on these things.

**00:29:40** Yeah, that Roombas have gotten so good because now they have cameras in them.

**00:29:46** And this camera and it has a light on it, too.

**00:29:50** So it lights its way.

**00:29:51** I was like, it has a little flashlight.

**00:29:52** I just saw that.

**00:29:53** It lights his way and goes out and like they have brains in them now.

**00:29:57** Right. And they like one of the things that I'm so impressed with.

**00:30:00** I have a bunch of things I'm impressed with.

**00:30:02** So one, it detects the rugs and knows that the rugs also won't pop the rug.

**00:30:06** It does not bump into stuff as much.

**00:30:09** One of the things that was always so funny is our old Roomba Robbie

**00:30:14** when cleaning around the dining table, it was just a nightmare.

**00:30:18** Bang, bang, bang, bang, every chair, everything.

**00:30:20** Rambo, the new Roomba, doesn't bump into the table

**00:30:25** because he knows it's there.

**00:30:27** And it also does all this stuff where, like, again,

**00:30:30** Robbie expected that all the rooms never changed.

**00:30:35** And if anything changed, you'd get a bit confused where Rambo expects things to

**00:30:41** change and so it has the map, but is willing to see what's going on.

**00:30:47** And like if something changes in the room, it's not like he doesn't clean that area.

**00:30:51** Like he can see something's changed in the room and we'll go around and clean it.

**00:30:55** And now as well, once he finishes the job, sends you a report and the report has

**00:31:01** pictures in it of like, what is this obstacle?

**00:31:04** Like, is this a permanent obstacle?

**00:31:06** Oh, I see.

**00:31:08** OK, so it's asking you, like, yeah, ran into a thing.

**00:31:10** What is this thing? Interesting.

**00:31:12** Including cables.

**00:31:14** So Rambo does not chew up cables like Robbie used to.

**00:31:17** Yeah.

**00:31:18** And like recognizes the cables and is like, what's going on here?

**00:31:23** Also something, this might be good for you.

**00:31:25** I don't know. Probably you wouldn't need it.

**00:31:26** But it's the pet people.

**00:31:28** They seem to have done so much work on detecting animal droppings.

**00:31:33** None of the dogs who stay with us.

**00:31:34** I know that any gray household, this could never be a problem.

**00:31:37** That and ever how that works.

**00:31:39** Yeah, they are very well trained.

**00:31:42** We clean their paws before they can come back in the house.

**00:31:45** It's a whole routine.

**00:31:46** The cleanest dogs in England.

**00:31:48** I've seen the cleaning.

**00:31:49** I've seen I've seen the dog cleaning off the walks.

**00:31:51** It's very intense.

**00:31:53** But these rumors empty themselves, which is so good.

**00:31:57** Old Roomba, old Robbie, we had to empty him.

**00:31:59** But they have these bases which have an extra vacuum in them.

**00:32:03** Right. And apparently it can do like six.

**00:32:06** It can empty it like 60 times or something before you would need to empty the base.

**00:32:11** Which is also very good.

**00:32:13** And then you can also do the it will do a map of the floor plan.

**00:32:17** And then in the app, you can delineate rooms,

**00:32:20** even if it's an open floor plan, like make zones and those zones.

**00:32:25** So then you could say, go and clean the kitchen, drive out, clean the kitchen, go back.

**00:32:31** I can't believe how much better these products have gotten in the last five years or whatever.

**00:32:37** It's kind of incredible, like the leaps, the difference between Rambo.

**00:32:41** I love Robbie.

**00:32:42** You know, he's a family.

**00:32:43** Robbie's not going anywhere.

**00:32:44** He's going to go upstairs.

**00:32:45** Right. And Robbie's going to do upstairs.

**00:32:48** But Rambo is like he's got a big brain going on.

**00:32:52** And he's a smart guy.

**00:32:53** Yeah, it looks it looks interesting.

**00:32:55** I think the test that I would want to do is we don't really have to worry about the

**00:32:59** accidents, but the pet toys are the big problem.

**00:33:02** And like one of our dog guests was very sad because his bone had disappeared the other

**00:33:06** day. And it's like, oh, I found it in Roomba.

**00:33:09** Right. It's like Roomba sucked it up.

**00:33:11** Oh, this is where your bone went.

**00:33:12** I'm so sorry. Here's a brand new one.

**00:33:14** You know, I've seen it in the vacuum was video like it's not perfect.

**00:33:18** Right. Like you will grab things.

**00:33:20** But it seemed very good like he was doing it with toys and stuff.

**00:33:24** And most of the time it's like going around them.

**00:33:27** Yeah, that's what I'm curious about.

**00:33:29** Yeah, I don't know. I have to put this on the consider list.

**00:33:32** I think that base for us is a little bit tricky because we don't have a great spot

**00:33:35** for a base. You don't have to do that.

**00:33:37** Oh, is that optional?

**00:33:38** Yeah, it's optional. It's an optional additional purchase.

**00:33:43** OK, I thought that because whatever it was, their last one had a base,

**00:33:45** but like it wasn't optional. It had to it had to work with it.

**00:33:49** But if there's a not base option, I might then we might consider that.

**00:33:52** I believe you just get you can get one.

**00:33:55** It's just a regular charging base, not the like big vacuum charging base.

**00:34:01** One of the things we absolutely love is when it's Roomba's time to vacuum.

**00:34:05** We have ours just perfectly hidden right under this little cabinet in the kitchen

**00:34:09** that is just barely taller than he is.

**00:34:12** And so like it is so cute to watch him like back up and come out and then like go back

**00:34:17** in after he's done it is it is never not funny to watch like we just can't not look

**00:34:22** at it for a second, but that's partly just a space constraint that we just don't

**00:34:26** have anywhere to put a real base like that in the house.

**00:34:29** So yeah, that's interesting.

**00:34:30** So you can the one I have is the J7 combo.

**00:34:34** But the difference is one has the base and one doesn't.

**00:34:37** I've got I've got to think about it.

**00:34:38** It might be it might be time for Roomba upgrade.

**00:34:41** This looks very interesting.

**00:34:43** I wanted to ask you if you would play it around with Obsidian Canvas.

**00:34:49** Oh, no.

**00:34:52** So I saw that this came out.

**00:34:54** I think this is this is for anybody who's listening and uses Obsidian.

**00:34:57** This might be an interesting tool to try.

**00:34:59** This this looks like a bit of a bit like some of the tools that you use

**00:35:03** sometimes of just like you have a more flexible workspace where you can connect

**00:35:08** a bunch of different text boxes and images with lines.

**00:35:11** It's just like a digital whiteboard is the way it looks like.

**00:35:13** But what I like about the look of this.

**00:35:15** So I've been eyeing this gray.

**00:35:17** This is the first.

**00:35:18** No, wait a minute.

**00:35:19** What do you mean you've been okay?

**00:35:22** I have ever looked at Obsidian and could see myself there.

**00:35:26** Oh my God.

**00:35:27** That's no way.

**00:35:29** Really? Because what I like about it is you can have all of your notes as you do.

**00:35:35** Right. And they can be whatever.

**00:35:36** But then you can create these boards that are visual representations of things

**00:35:42** which could include web pages and images and videos, but also the notes embedded

**00:35:48** in the page. And there's just something about that where I'm like, that works.

**00:35:53** How my brain works.

**00:35:55** So I've had the web page open for a while and I have yet to dive in.

**00:35:59** But I've been wondering if like this could be something for me.

**00:36:03** This could do what I'm using Kraft for anyway.

**00:36:07** Yeah.

**00:36:08** But could also give me this additional thing, which is this like rather than

**00:36:13** having like a folder of notes.

**00:36:16** So let me give you an example.

**00:36:17** So one of the things that I will do is sort of like say with the theme system

**00:36:21** journal, I have a whole folder of notes for the journal.

**00:36:25** But if I'm planning something new,

**00:36:28** like let's imagine that when I did the new layout, the 2.0 layout,

**00:36:32** right, which is what's in there now, I had my drawings and then I had

**00:36:37** manufacturers information, then I had pricing information and all that kind of

**00:36:43** stuff. Now, I could imagine having a like 2.0

**00:36:47** board that had all of that just visible in one place.

**00:36:51** And I like that instead of looking at just like a list of notes in a folder,

**00:36:56** I could just see them all.

**00:36:57** So like I could need one piece of information.

**00:37:00** I got it here.

**00:37:00** I've got another piece of information there.

**00:37:03** Like it seems really intriguing to me.

**00:37:06** I mean, I'll just also just point out that presuming that it works in Dropbox,

**00:37:09** which I imagine it does, you could have limited sharing with somebody else for

**00:37:13** some of these, if that's a thing that you wanted to do.

**00:37:15** Yeah, it's funny.

**00:37:17** I didn't really think about you using it.

**00:37:18** I looked at it and I thought about you just in the sense of, oh, this is this is

**00:37:23** like the tool that Mike likes to use a kind of virtual whiteboard.

**00:37:27** And I can 100 percent see why lots of people are interested in this,

**00:37:31** which is why if you've heard me talk about Obsidian,

**00:37:33** I think it might be interesting for anyone to just go look at this tool and see if

**00:37:36** it might be something that you want to use.

**00:37:38** But I literally haven't opened it or tried it on my Obsidian install because

**00:37:44** this kind of thing just isn't for me.

**00:37:46** This is not the way my brain wants to organize information.

**00:37:50** Yeah, I'm much more like the thing that I

**00:37:51** want and that I think the maximum version of this, which Obsidian does,

**00:37:55** but it's like the Rome research version of this, where you have a kind of

**00:38:00** everything is a bullet point in a list and you can like indent,

**00:38:03** outdent or like open and close different levels of that bullet pointed list.

**00:38:07** That's what I use Obsidian for.

**00:38:09** And that's always kind of the way my brain works is like I want to have

**00:38:13** this and the arranging things in arbitrary space on a whiteboard.

**00:38:17** It just has never really worked for me.

**00:38:19** But I do think it's a very smart move

**00:38:21** by the Obsidian developers to add this other tool.

**00:38:26** Oh, now they must capture like 95 percent of the way people want to organize random

**00:38:31** notes. You fall into these two camps.

**00:38:33** Do you want it more visual or do you want it more just purely text based?

**00:38:38** I mean, look, I'll just say, Mike, if you ever want to play around with Obsidian,

**00:38:41** I am more than happy to help you get set up with it.

**00:38:44** If that's a thing that you want to do.

**00:38:46** Maybe actually, because the only reason,

**00:38:49** because it's been out for a while in the beta, at least,

**00:38:51** I think it might be in the shipping version now since I first looked at it.

**00:38:55** It is in the shipping version.

**00:38:56** It's released in the shipping version now.

**00:38:57** Because this one in again, how long has been this?

**00:38:59** This went into my show notes document when they had it in like their first kind

**00:39:03** of open preview of it.

**00:39:05** Yeah, I only found out about it through the change log updates to the shipping

**00:39:09** version and like and with Obsidian, I'm like, please give me the stable only branch.

**00:39:14** This is not the time to use your beta software.

**00:39:17** But like I'm just I feel quite intimidated about starting.

**00:39:22** Yeah, you're not wrong to because Obsidian is like a real big thing to just open

**00:39:27** and go look at just a ton of those options.

**00:39:30** So I'm happy to hold your hand through the Obsidian set up and guide you to just

**00:39:36** the relevant things to whatever it is you're trying to accomplish.

**00:39:39** That is a very intriguing prospect to me.

**00:39:41** I'm going to put a pin in that one.

**00:39:43** I want to come back to that.

**00:39:44** Because I need a guide and then I'll be fine.

**00:39:48** I will be your Obsidian guide.

**00:39:51** This episode is brought to you by FitBod.

**00:39:54** Hey, it's a new year.

**00:39:55** Typically a time many of us are thinking about changing up our fitness plans.

**00:39:59** Maybe you have fitness as part of your yearly theme.

**00:40:02** So I'm super pleased to let you know that FitBod is both an easy and affordable way

**00:40:07** to build a fitness plan just for you.

**00:40:09** FitBod has a really smart algorithm built

**00:40:12** into the awesome app that learns about you, your goals and your training ability.

**00:40:16** This is going to create a custom dynamic

**00:40:18** program based on your experience and any equipment that you have all in their app,

**00:40:22** making it incredibly easy to learn how to perform every single exercise.

**00:40:26** Personal fitness isn't about competing with other people.

**00:40:29** Don't look to others and try to do what they do.

**00:40:32** You need something that's going to work

**00:40:33** just for you because that's when it sticks and you're going to see the results

**00:40:37** that you're looking for. Everybody has their own fitness path,

**00:40:40** which is why FitBod uses data to make sure they customize things to suit you exactly.

**00:40:44** They have powerful technology to understand your strength training ability.

**00:40:48** It studies your past workouts and then

**00:40:50** adapts to your available gym equipment and your training plan will maximize

**00:40:54** fitness gains by intelligently varying intensity and volume between sessions

**00:41:00** because overworking some muscles while

**00:41:01** underworking others can negatively impact results, which is why FitBod tracks your

**00:41:06** muscle fatigue and recovery to design a well-balanced workout routine.

**00:41:11** The FitBod app is so simple to use over

**00:41:13** 1,400 HD video tutorials shot from multiple angles to make sure that learning

**00:41:18** every exercise is a breeze. I find this to be so important.

**00:41:21** So I make sure that I'm feeling confident in the new exercises that I'm trying out.

**00:41:25** FitBod also integrates with Apple Watch,

**00:41:28** Wear OS smart watches and apps like Strava Fitbit and Apple Health.

**00:41:33** Personalized training of this quality can be expensive,

**00:41:35** but FitBod is just $12.99 a month or $79.99 a year.

**00:41:40** But you can get 25% off your membership by signing up at fitbod.me slash cortex.

**00:41:46** So go now and get your customized fitness plan at fitbod.me slash cortex.

**00:41:51** And you will get 25% off your membership when you do.

**00:41:54** F-I-T-B-O-D dot me slash cortex for 25% off.

**00:41:59** Thanks to FitBod for their support of this show and Relay FM.

**00:42:03** We had mentioned the pens that we collaborate with the Apple Mention

**00:42:07** Studio on the Mark 1 pens. Oh, yeah.

**00:42:09** We mentioned that before they weren't in stock.

**00:42:11** They are in stock now.

**00:42:12** So if you go to cortexmerch.com, we have a small number and we're ordering more.

**00:42:16** I'm hoping to try and keep them more in stock now.

**00:42:18** So if you heard us mention it and you heard us say we don't have any none to sell you,

**00:42:23** we do currently have some to sell you.

**00:42:25** Go to cortexmerch.com. You can see it there.

**00:42:27** Well, you should be able to.

**00:42:29** Again, the numbers are always limited.

**00:42:30** But as of right now, we have them.

**00:42:32** I was just trying to remember like, wait, why did we mention that we have pens that

**00:42:37** you couldn't buy at the time?

**00:42:38** But it was the theme episode.

**00:42:39** We were reviewing like what had been going on and talking about, oh, we have this

**00:42:43** product that we never talk about because it's very hard to keep it in stock.

**00:42:47** We were just having that as part of the theme review of the year.

**00:42:50** But yes, I love these pens and we definitely still are in that difficult to

**00:42:55** keep in stock phase with it a bit like we were with the journal years ago.

**00:42:59** So go check it out right now at cortexmerch.com.

**00:43:03** Limited numbers, hopefully slightly less limited this time.

**00:43:06** But yeah, we'll see how it goes.

**00:43:08** I have some scripts for you.

**00:43:10** What do you mean you have a script for me?

**00:43:12** I have asked chat GPT.

**00:43:15** Oh, no.

**00:43:16** To write three cold opens for the show.

**00:43:20** I mean, Mike, how can you how can you just jump into something like this?

**00:43:26** You don't even you don't even want to tell the people what chat GPT is.

**00:43:30** I can't.

**00:43:31** I don't think I have the ability to do that.

**00:43:34** I don't have the words.

**00:43:35** Maybe you have the words.

**00:43:36** I don't have them.

**00:43:37** OK, wait. Before you talk about the script,

**00:43:41** I went back and I listened to the last sort of in time episode we did,

**00:43:46** which is two episodes ago before the themes episode, before the state of the apps.

**00:43:51** When we were just having a regular cortex and talking in October,

**00:43:55** we both made a joke at the end about how we had two episodes about A.I.

**00:44:01** art in a row and like how fast and suddenly all of this thing was coming online.

**00:44:06** And at the end of that episode, we realized, oh, we won't be able to have an in time

**00:44:10** episode until January. And we were like, oh, my God, what on earth is going to

**00:44:15** happen between now and January?

**00:44:17** And I feel like, man, we did not have any idea what was going to happen.

**00:44:22** I literally think what happened was like

**00:44:26** day zero for the whole of the Internet suddenly becoming aware that A.I.

**00:44:33** is really a thing. It was early December.

**00:44:36** This tool called chat GPT was released,

**00:44:40** which is like an A.I. chat bot that you can talk to.

**00:44:44** And this is the thing that I'd said it many times during our A.I.

**00:44:48** art episodes, where I kept talking about how like the A.I.

**00:44:51** art is cool.

**00:44:52** The language models are scary, but it was always kind of hard.

**00:44:56** Like I was just saying a thing because I had seen private demos behind the scenes

**00:45:01** about some of this stuff, and it's a bit hard in that scenario to like try to

**00:45:05** convince people. I was like, oh, no, like the language models are now very public

**00:45:11** and people can play with them and talk to them and see what they can do.

**00:45:16** And I happened to be at home with my parents the day it came out.

**00:45:20** Boy, was that an interesting day on the Internet?

**00:45:23** And I like I was showing my parents this kind of tech demo of like, look,

**00:45:27** there's this thing you can talk to and it will respond in very smart ways

**00:45:33** that you wouldn't expect. You can ask questions of it and it can give you answers.

**00:45:38** You can ask it to do all sorts of tasks and it can complete them.

**00:45:42** So, yeah, chat GPT is like the first public facing, actually useful in some

**00:45:48** circumstances language model that people can play and test with and see.

**00:45:54** So that's the background just in case someone hasn't heard about it

**00:45:58** and hasn't messed around with it. So so now tell me, what did you ask

**00:46:02** chat GPT to do in terms of a script?

**00:46:05** What I wanted it to do was to give us a cold open intro for the episode.

**00:46:11** So the thing that happens before the, you know,

**00:46:14** which very frequently in the show's history has had some kind of conversation

**00:46:19** about microphone issues. Well, yeah.

**00:46:21** So I asked it for prompts in these areas.

**00:46:24** One of them was write a cold open intro

**00:46:26** for the Cortex podcast featuring CGP, Graham, Mike Hurley.

**00:46:29** Ensure there is some conversation about issues with microphone.

**00:46:33** So that was the first one I had to like, this is well, this wasn't the first one.

**00:46:38** I asked it a couple of things before and it kept talking about brains.

**00:46:41** So I had to kind of like, kind of like bring it around again.

**00:46:45** Do you want to read through these as the AI has written them?

**00:46:48** Well, I don't know because I feel like the one I'm looking at that you have

**00:46:52** in the show notes is just not very good because that's what I that's why.

**00:46:57** So I have three.

**00:46:58** I think these three differ in their goodness.

**00:47:02** OK, so here's here's the first one.

**00:47:03** So Mike and I will be performing our roles as written for us by GPT.

**00:47:09** Begin the scene.

**00:47:11** Hey, everyone, welcome back to another episode of Cortex.

**00:47:14** I'm CGP Gray and with me, as always, is Mike Hurley.

**00:47:17** Hey there. Happy to be here as always.

**00:47:20** But man, I had a bit of a nightmare setting up my microphone today.

**00:47:24** My computer seemed to be having some issues and I wasn't getting any sound on my end.

**00:47:28** Oh, no, that sounds frustrating.

**00:47:30** I know I've had my fair share of microphone issues in the past.

**00:47:33** It's always a bit of a hassle to get everything right.

**00:47:36** Yeah, it can be a real pain, but we're finally all set up and ready to go.

**00:47:40** So let's dive into today's topic.

**00:47:42** Sounds good to me. Let's get started.

**00:47:44** Intro music fades out and see.

**00:47:48** That's bad because it's just extremely generic.

**00:47:51** Extremely generic.

**00:47:52** Well, one thing chat GPT doesn't know who would be most likely to have the issues in

**00:47:58** chat GPTs, while I have a problem, which never happens.

**00:48:01** Yeah, never never happens.

**00:48:03** It never happens.

**00:48:04** Tell me when it happened.

**00:48:06** I feel like it happened off microphone.

**00:48:07** We just never have been able to capture it live.

**00:48:10** That's why it's just this memory.

**00:48:11** I think that's the way it works.

**00:48:13** OK, also, we'll just pause here for a second because, well, maybe we'll talk about it

**00:48:17** later, but chat GPT has some weird limitations on it.

**00:48:22** And one of these things is like they've limited how much it knows about the

**00:48:27** current world. And I think there's just an interesting question of like,

**00:48:32** does it know what the Cortex podcast even is?

**00:48:36** So that's why I feel like this is a hard one because it might not have any concept

**00:48:40** of the Cortex podcast. It does.

**00:48:42** It does. In some ways that I asked this

**00:48:45** question, they just weren't very interesting.

**00:48:47** They were using words from our show

**00:48:51** description and episode descriptions to talk about what Cortex was.

**00:48:57** So like productivity show, we're going to actually one of them does have it.

**00:49:01** So like you'll hear it in the third example.

**00:49:04** OK, that, you know, it feels like it's

**00:49:06** just Googled Cortex, but like at least it is aware of it enough.

**00:49:11** OK, all right. So do you want to run through the second one?

**00:49:13** Yeah. OK, begin scene.

**00:49:16** The sound of static and muffled voices can be heard as the episode begins.

**00:49:22** Mike, what's going on with the microphones?

**00:49:24** Just a sec.

**00:49:25** Let me check the connections.

**00:49:27** It's always something with these microphones.

**00:49:30** Welcome to the Cortex podcast, where technical difficulties are just another

**00:49:34** part of the show.

**00:49:35** I guess you're right.

**00:49:37** All right, we're good to go. Let's get started.

**00:49:39** Today, we're going to talk about the

**00:49:41** latest advancements in neural networks and how they're changing the way we think

**00:49:45** about A.I. And we'll also be discussing some of the ethical implications of these

**00:49:49** developments. It's going to be a great episode.

**00:49:51** So let's dive in.

**00:49:53** The sound of intro music begins to play as the episode officially starts.

**00:49:58** So there's also stage directions in this one, which just threw me in the like,

**00:50:01** threw me in the middle of it.

**00:50:03** I didn't read them out loud, but it's like more static and muffling.

**00:50:06** The sound of the microphones being adjusted can be heard.

**00:50:09** It's also telling us to laugh, which is also weird.

**00:50:12** Yeah. So it's giving us emotional instructions like CGP, gray, colon,

**00:50:17** brackets, frustrated, like what's going on with these microphones?

**00:50:20** Mike Hurley, calmly, just a sec.

**00:50:23** Let's check the connections.

**00:50:24** So this again is like,

**00:50:26** I think we need to just pause here for a moment, because even this is kind of

**00:50:32** mind blowing when you start playing around with it to realize like, oh,

**00:50:35** I can type into a machine, give me a script for a podcast.

**00:50:41** And it does spit out like this is as stage directions or more like closed

**00:50:46** captions, right? Here's the person.

**00:50:48** Here's the sound that's taking place in the background.

**00:50:50** Here's what they're saying, like alternating the dialogue between these two

**00:50:53** people, even here, just a little bit.

**00:50:56** One of the bigger deals that you can see is

**00:51:00** it understands the previous state of things, which was always a limit

**00:51:04** with the older tools like GPT three, which is why they were never very

**00:51:08** impressive, is it would just like respond to the previous sentence

**00:51:13** and tell you something.

**00:51:15** And that was it. Whereas here you can just be like, just keep writing a conversation

**00:51:19** and it will keep track of the state of the conversation.

**00:51:22** Like the conversation can progress and respond to itself

**00:51:26** in all sorts of ways that it couldn't before.

**00:51:28** So do you want to go through the third conversation here?

**00:51:31** Yeah, I think this is the best one.

**00:51:33** I gave it a little bit more.

**00:51:34** OK, my prompt was write a cold open for the Cortex podcast.

**00:51:38** You see, GP Grey and Mike Hurley.

**00:51:39** They're having microphone issues as always.

**00:51:42** At the end, they say levels, levels.

**00:51:45** OK, all right.

**00:51:45** OK, begin scene.

**00:51:48** Sound of microphone feedback.

**00:51:51** Oh, here we go again.

**00:51:52** Yep. It's just another day at the Cortex office.

**00:51:55** Can you hear me now?

**00:51:56** Not really, no.

**00:51:58** All right. Let me adjust the levels here.

**00:52:00** Yeah, levels.

**00:52:01** Levels are key.

**00:52:02** OK, I think we're good now.

**00:52:04** Finally.

**00:52:05** Welcome to Cortex.

**00:52:07** I'm CGP Grey and with me, as always, is Mike Hurley.

**00:52:09** Yep. And we are having microphone issues as always.

**00:52:13** Yep. But we're here to talk about all things productivity, creativity and technology.

**00:52:18** Levels, levels.

**00:52:19** Levels, levels.

**00:52:20** Let's get started.

**00:52:23** That's the best one, I think.

**00:52:24** I still feel like it's a little generic, but it's interesting that

**00:52:27** with the greater direction, you can push it.

**00:52:30** You can force it more towards creating what it is that you want to create.

**00:52:34** I think this kind of thing would be much better if you used examples of vastly more

**00:52:41** well-known people that it would have databases of.

**00:52:44** Like, I think that's why you end up getting this, like,

**00:52:47** genericness, is it just doesn't really know very much about us.

**00:52:51** But if you pick two celebrities or well-known politicians,

**00:52:55** people for whom there's a large corpus of them talking,

**00:52:58** having played around with chat GPT, you can get some absolutely

**00:53:03** frighteningly impressive examples of whatever it is you're looking for.

**00:53:08** It's particularly good at poetry.

**00:53:10** Yeah, they use that example a lot.

**00:53:12** Like, for example, I was trying to get some of these because the first one I did

**00:53:16** ages ago and the two most recent ones, I actually got those today because for the

**00:53:21** past few days I've been trying to access chat GPT and it's been down because of

**00:53:24** load issues or whatever.

**00:53:26** And on their kind of like waiting screen as such, they just generate poetry.

**00:53:31** Yeah, I was just loading up it now and it's getting the same thing of like chat

**00:53:35** GPT is at capacity right now, probably because the whole world is trying to use it.

**00:53:40** The thing that, of course, I wanted to see just straight away was

**00:53:45** when I first got a chance to try it hands on was I asked it basically sort of generic

**00:53:52** school homework essay type questions.

**00:53:56** So here's the thing that you can do.

**00:53:57** Right. You can say I need a book report

**00:54:00** about the themes in Lord of the Flies as they relate to modern politics in Germany

**00:54:08** written as though I was a 10th grader in Germany.

**00:54:13** And it will do that.

**00:54:15** Right. Like it'll boom, boom, boom, boom.

**00:54:17** Like totally spit out a very good seven paragraph essay that will do that kind of

**00:54:24** thing and the ability to even tweak it to be like, don't make it too good.

**00:54:29** Right. I'm just in 12th grade or I'm in fourth grade.

**00:54:34** My dad had a really good one where he

**00:54:35** asked it something along the lines of I'm a fourth grader and need to do a

**00:54:41** presentation on grasshoppers or something like some kind of insect.

**00:54:46** And please write the script for me for what I need to say in front of the class as a

**00:54:50** fourth grader. Oh, my God, this was unbelievably good for like,

**00:54:53** this is exactly what a fourth grader would would do and say if they were writing

**00:54:57** a report on some bug. I did the Lord of the Flies one as you were talking.

**00:55:01** It's good. Oh, did you get through?

**00:55:03** Yeah. Yeah.

**00:55:04** My first take on this was, oh, this is the death of homework.

**00:55:10** Yeah. Why do you why do you say, yeah, like that?

**00:55:13** Well, OK, so I if a homework maybe it will will fly because by and large, right,

**00:55:20** like I'm imagining you can correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm imagining most homework

**00:55:26** essays read similarly from kids like there isn't a lot of variation

**00:55:31** except for I expect in some outstanding student.

**00:55:33** So whatever might be able to turn something in, which is genuinely different in some

**00:55:37** way. Right.

**00:55:39** But like what I feel like I've seen a lot

**00:55:41** with chat GPT is people saying like this is going to change marketing because of

**00:55:47** this and then they, you know, they will give a prompt and they'll have some kind

**00:55:51** of response and the response is they just feel like somebody went to Google and

**00:55:55** typed in the question and then copy and pasted the answers because that is I feel

**00:56:00** like ultimately at the moment, a lot of what is going on here.

**00:56:03** Right. It's like this information exists

**00:56:06** somewhere online, this model that they are using has sucked in all this

**00:56:10** information and can interpret it. But what that means is, at least to me,

**00:56:15** it feels like a lot of the stuff is written like that.

**00:56:19** Like somebody went to Google and Wikipedia and did some research and wrote

**00:56:24** something about it that doesn't feel like a lot of originality,

**00:56:27** at least in some of these things that I've seen, which tend to be along the lines of

**00:56:31** like, oh, watch out for your job.

**00:56:35** And again, this is whatever version it is.

**00:56:39** Right. But it's effectively to the public version one.

**00:56:41** It is already very impressive here.

**00:56:44** But I just don't know if I would be ready to say, like, this is the end of every

**00:56:48** type of thinking work because chat GPT can just do it for us.

**00:56:52** Yeah, I want to be clear here.

**00:56:53** I'm not saying it's the end of every kind of thinking work.

**00:56:56** Right. That's not what chat GPT is.

**00:56:58** No way. But it's a lot of people are saying.

**00:57:01** Right. You know, like I feel like a lot of the conversation is just like, wow,

**00:57:05** this is it now. Well, yeah.

**00:57:07** So even though I have definitely been the AI doom and gloom person chat GPT

**00:57:12** in its current form, I don't think is that there's a reason.

**00:57:16** There's a reason that I picked homework in particular.

**00:57:19** Yeah, because homework to me is just I mean,

**00:57:23** so much of it is just obvious work and it's it's like not really.

**00:57:28** I mean, like I'm just I'm trying to think about how to express some ideas.

**00:57:32** One of the things with a lot of questions that like you as a teacher,

**00:57:37** you actually you actually kind of want very low variance in the essays you get

**00:57:43** back from students because it makes them way easier to mark.

**00:57:47** So like if you're a student and you've

**00:57:48** ever had your school teach you something of like, oh, hey,

**00:57:51** if you're writing a little essay that needs to argue for a point,

**00:57:55** it needs to follow this five paragraph structure.

**00:57:58** It's like you introduce the idea with and here is your thesis and then you have

**00:58:04** like three paragraphs about it and then you summarize why that was great in the end

**00:58:09** or whatever, like different schools have different versions of this.

**00:58:12** You're not being given that because it's a great way to write a convincing essay.

**00:58:16** You're given that because it's real easy to mark.

**00:58:19** That's why you are given that is like, oh,

**00:58:23** if I have to spend less of my marks and thinking time on the actual essay and can

**00:58:30** instead be evaluating structure of things that dramatically reduces the

**00:58:35** workload in marking an essay like that might not be obvious.

**00:58:39** But like schools don't teach you how to write convincingly.

**00:58:42** They're optimizing for a teacher has to mark a 100 or 200 or 300 of these things.

**00:58:49** And so having them all be in a format as a student.

**00:58:53** For written homework questions and like book reports and all kinds of things.

**00:58:59** There is a weird way in which you're kind of punished for thinking very

**00:59:04** creatively or doing something different.

**00:59:07** You need to have something that just like fits in the pipeline.

**00:59:11** And in many ways, you're kind of optimizing for not catching the teacher's attention.

**00:59:17** And that's why I think like chat GPT is like, oh, my God,

**00:59:20** it's the most perfect tool for this.

**00:59:22** That's what's going on here.

**00:59:24** The fourth grade of Grasshopper thing, by the way, is awesome.

**00:59:27** Oh, OK. Can you want to read this little sample?

**00:59:29** I still can't get through.

**00:59:30** Hi, everyone. Today, I'm going to talk to you about Grasshoppers.

**00:59:33** Grasshoppers are really cool bugs that you might see in your backyard or at the park.

**00:59:38** They're green and have big legs so they can jump really far.

**00:59:41** Grasshoppers eat plants and leaves and they have big jaws that help them chew up

**00:59:44** their food. They also have big eyes so they can see where they're going when they jump.

**00:59:48** This is my favorite part of Grasshoppers lay their eggs in the ground.

**00:59:51** When they hatch, they look like little mini grasshoppers.

**00:59:54** They grow bigger and bigger until they become adults.

**00:59:57** That's it for my presentation about Grasshoppers.

**00:59:59** I hope you learned something new and cool about these bugs.

**01:00:02** Thanks for listening.

**01:00:04** That's great. That really is like a fourth grade.

**01:00:05** It's great, right?

**01:00:06** I can include in the hi, everyone.

**01:00:08** Like, it's great.

**01:00:09** Do they look like mini grasshoppers or do they look like larvae?

**01:00:12** I don't actually know.

**01:00:12** But that seems like something a kid would say, right?

**01:00:14** Totally. Yeah. Yeah.

**01:00:15** That's a perfect kid sentence.

**01:00:17** And like you totally you totally can get really creative things out of this.

**01:00:24** OK, so one of the one here's one of the issues that I've had with what's happened

**01:00:27** with Chant GPT when it came out is if anyone's listening to this show now

**01:00:32** and they're like, oh, I haven't heard of this thing before.

**01:00:34** Let me go try it.

**01:00:35** The version that you're going to try is almost certainly less interesting

**01:00:41** than the version right now that Mike and I are talking about.

**01:00:44** And it's definitely less interesting than the one that went out on launch day

**01:00:49** because I have a feeling that the people behind Chant GPT were

**01:00:55** quite surprised by like the entirety of the Internet trying to get this thing

**01:01:02** to do everything on one day, and it became very clear that they were like

**01:01:07** live coding in more and more restrictions on what it would do,

**01:01:13** what it wouldn't do or what it would say or what it would not say.

**01:01:17** And so it was very fun to be on the Internet on launch day where you could

**01:01:21** like where people were doing all sorts of things to like trick it or try to get

**01:01:26** around its restrictions. And it was super interesting that first day.

**01:01:30** And I've been using it since and it's clearly become less interesting

**01:01:35** and much more formulaic with a lot of stuff.

**01:01:37** I mean, it was also a little bit more depressing, too.

**01:01:41** Right. Because there was so many biases

**01:01:44** because based on what the Internet was pulling in.

**01:01:47** Yeah, but like what these systems are is they're.

**01:01:55** They're like,

**01:01:56** here's here's my problem, like so when people describe how these things work,

**01:02:00** you talk about, oh, it's it's kind of producing like a

**01:02:04** statistically likely output based on the input of text.

**01:02:10** And I think that both kind of over and under sells the thing.

**01:02:14** Like there's a way in which people use that to dismiss it where they go.

**01:02:18** Well, there's no thinking that's happening.

**01:02:20** It's just you fed it a bunch of text and it's just giving you back what's in the

**01:02:24** text. It's like, yes, that's true.

**01:02:27** But I also kind of think that's what a lot of people are doing.

**01:02:30** Like I really think a lot of people are very chat GPT like where it's like

**01:02:35** when you talk to someone, I don't know, sometimes you could feel more and more

**01:02:38** like, oh, I'm just talking with a thing that's giving me like the most probable

**01:02:42** answers in this conversation.

**01:02:43** I mean, or sometimes like I'm talking with the Facebook algorithm.

**01:02:46** I can feel that in talking to you.

**01:02:49** I can see where you get your news and I can see what is affecting you.

**01:02:53** And I, you know, like I feel like I am talking to a news algorithm in a person.

**01:02:59** Yeah, it's funny that you bring that up because.

**01:03:03** So if anyone listening to the show ever

**01:03:05** does the thing that I have often suggested, which is like pulling back from

**01:03:09** news in very many ways or like try or like I've done, you take major breaks

**01:03:14** from the Internet, there totally is what you've just said, Mike.

**01:03:18** This weird thing that becomes much more

**01:03:21** obvious is like how ideas are spread and how ideas get into people.

**01:03:29** And you can

**01:03:31** like you were aware of it before, but when you're really distant from things, it

**01:03:36** it becomes very clear, like, oh, I'm not talking to a person.

**01:03:39** I'm talking to this news channel.

**01:03:41** And like that's everything that's in that person's head.

**01:03:44** Or like you said, oh, this is like I know what corner of the Internet this person

**01:03:48** exists in and I'm talking to that corner of the Internet.

**01:03:52** And so, yeah, like I think that's actually a really good way to describe the way

**01:03:57** chat GPT works in person form.

**01:04:00** And yeah, we can know that experience.

**01:04:03** So so this is why I think it's funny when

**01:04:05** people use this to like undersell what chat GPT is doing.

**01:04:09** And they're like, I can't be very interesting.

**01:04:11** It's just going to reflect whatever it's been fed.

**01:04:14** Yeah.

**01:04:15** But also, I think that's how brains work, like they reflect what they have been fed.

**01:04:19** So like this is not the the slam dunk argument against this system being able

**01:04:25** to do things.

**01:04:26** Well, I do have a counterpart on that, which is if we like, you know, for the type

**01:04:31** of person that believes that this is like the future of everything, right, of which

**01:04:35** there are definitely a subset of people, if chat GPT just works by what it is

**01:04:40** ingested, if we assume that all great thought will come from these AI

**01:04:45** robots in the future, where are they going to get the new from?

**01:04:49** Like if they end up just like cycling through all of the stuff that other

**01:04:52** AI is generated, like that's the thing that I don't know if I know the answer to

**01:04:56** that, right, like if these things work by ingesting a bunch of stuff,

**01:05:00** where does the new come in?

**01:05:02** I mean, look, we can't possibly do this because it would just take too long.

**01:05:05** I think to have a complete conversation about what is occurring with AI and where

**01:05:13** can it go is a question that really has to dive quite deeply down into what do you

**01:05:19** think thinking is and that like many things ultimately dives down to the very

**01:05:28** bottom of the universe, atoms and electromagnetic fields interacting with

**01:05:32** each other. And like I've had that conversation with people, but that just

**01:05:36** like it's too much to talk about it.

**01:05:38** Sure.

**01:05:39** Like it just takes forever.

**01:05:41** Like my summary on it is like my perspective is that what we are doing in metal

**01:05:48** and software is not fundamentally different than what is being done with meat and

**01:05:54** neurons firing.

**01:05:56** I think, yeah, like these things will eventually get better and better.

**01:05:59** And so the question of like, does something new come out of that?

**01:06:04** I really think it's a metaphor just like a like a human brain.

**01:06:08** Human brains are just like ingesting the world that's around them.

**01:06:11** But they do still produce things that we think are new in some way.

**01:06:16** But like as of right now, human brains are just way bigger than these.

**01:06:23** I should rephrase that. It's not that they're bigger.

**01:06:25** I think the neuron numbers might actually be comparable, but they're significantly

**01:06:29** more interconnected than these systems are.

**01:06:32** I don't think it's impossible, but I don't think what I'm seeing right now tells me

**01:06:38** that it's possible, if that makes sense.

**01:06:40** Yeah. What I'm seeing right now is interesting.

**01:06:43** It does not tell me.

**01:06:44** I do not feel like I can draw a very clear line to original thought.

**01:08:48** So, OK, this might be a little long for the podcast, but I want to give you what

**01:08:52** was my best response with chat GPT.

**01:08:56** And this was on day one.

**01:08:59** Here is the prompt.

**01:09:00** I said, write a fictional story about coffee beans.

**01:09:04** So here was the story.

**01:09:06** Once upon a time in a land far, far away,

**01:09:09** there lived a group of magical coffee beans.

**01:09:11** These beans were not like the ordinary coffee beans that you might find in your

**01:09:15** local grocery store. No, these beans were special,

**01:09:18** each with its own unique personality and characteristics.

**01:09:22** There was the bold and brash robusta bean who always wanted to be the center of

**01:09:27** attention. He loved to boast about his high caffeine content and his strong,

**01:09:31** full bodied flavor, but his boastfulness often got him into trouble.

**01:09:35** And he often found himself being ground up and brewed into strong,

**01:09:39** bitter cups of coffee that no one wanted to drink.

**01:09:44** Next, there was the delicate and refined Arabia bean.

**01:09:47** She was the most popular of all the coffee beans with a delicate floral aroma

**01:09:51** and a smooth, sweet flavor.

**01:09:53** She was often sought after by the finest coffee shops and restaurants,

**01:09:57** and she was always in demand.

**01:09:59** But she was also very sensitive and she didn't like being roasted too dark or

**01:10:03** brewed too strong, lest she lose her delicate flavor.

**01:10:07** Then there was the exotic and mysterious

**01:10:10** mocha bean who hailed from the distant land of Yemen.

**01:10:13** He was a rare and valuable bean with a deep, rich flavor and a hint of chocolatey

**01:10:18** sweetness, but he was also very fickle and could only be grown in certain

**01:10:22** conditions, making him difficult to cultivate and harvest.

**01:10:25** Finally, there was the jolly and cheerful espresso bean who always wanted to be in

**01:10:30** a good mood. He was a small but mighty bean with an intense,

**01:10:34** concentrated flavor that could give anyone a kick of energy.

**01:10:38** But he could also be a bit of a hothead.

**01:10:39** And if he was brewed too long, he could become bitter and burnt tasting.

**01:10:44** All of the coffee beans lived together in harmony,

**01:10:46** each with their own unique flavor and personality.

**01:10:49** But one day, disaster struck when a group

**01:10:52** of evil scientists decided to create a Frankenbean,

**01:10:56** a monstrous hybrid of all the different coffee beans.

**01:10:59** The Frankenbean was huge and powerful with the caffeine content of a robusta,

**01:11:04** the smoothness of the Arabia, the richness of a mocha and the intensity of an espresso.

**01:11:10** But the Frankenbean quickly turned on its creators,

**01:11:13** rampaging through the land and destroying everything in its path.

**01:11:17** The other coffee beans were terrified and they didn't know what to do.

**01:11:21** But just when all hope seemed lost, the bold and brash robusta beans stepped

**01:11:26** forward, bravely facing down the Frankenbean and using his high caffeine

**01:11:30** content to defeat it once and for all. And so the coffee beans lived happily ever

**01:11:37** after, each enjoying their own unique flavor and personality and never

**01:11:41** forgetting the brave robusta bean who saved them all.

**01:11:45** The end.

**01:11:46** Didn't stick the landing, but everything else was great.

**01:11:50** That's pretty good.

**01:11:51** Oh, it was great. It was very entertaining.

**01:11:53** I thought it was very funny, too. It was a good story.

**01:11:56** I think that's a great example of pulling from things that exist,

**01:12:02** but also creating something new that was much better than I was expecting for the

**01:12:08** prompt, write a fictional story about coffee beans.

**01:12:12** Yep. Yep.

**01:12:13** Now, I am very convinced that they have wildly turned down the ability of the thing

**01:12:18** since then, because I have not been getting similar kinds of responses when I

**01:12:22** use chat GPT now, but this was like the day one, you know, hour six.

**01:12:27** While I imagine all the engineers were panicking of like, everyone's trying to

**01:12:30** break our system out of the box, like, what are we going to do?

**01:12:34** So, yeah, anyway, I feel like

**01:12:37** that could basically be a children's illustrated story as it exists.

**01:12:43** Like you said, it doesn't quite stick the landing, but I feel like it's there.

**01:12:46** I could totally see that as like a kids illustrated storybook.

**01:12:50** One hundred percent.

**01:12:51** That's the best result that I got out of

**01:12:53** chat GPT when I was playing around with it on day one.

**01:12:56** And I think these things are only getting better.

**01:12:58** So I fully expect it's going to increase.

**01:13:01** One of the things that was very interesting was watching my father play around with it.

**01:13:05** And he got into a little loop of of asking it for movie scripts around various

**01:13:11** topics, write a script where Indiana Jones prevents a diamond heist, you know,

**01:13:15** that it would just like boom, boom, boom, put out whatever.

**01:13:18** And he was genuinely enthralled by reading them again on like the very first day.

**01:13:24** And so much so I could see like he just kept typing in like different movie scripts.

**01:13:27** And he's like, wow, it'll just like write the movie that I wanted to write.

**01:13:30** This is unbelievable.

**01:13:31** I think it is already there for some level of new creativity.

**01:13:38** It might not be amazingly new creativity,

**01:13:41** but I think it's doing something that's more than just

**01:13:45** more than just like a kind of Google copy and paste.

**01:13:48** That's what I think it's already doing.

**01:13:50** I can't express my feelings as such, but I feel differently to this than the image

**01:13:56** generation and I don't really know why.

**01:13:58** What do you mean? Do you feel like the image generation is more creative?

**01:14:03** No, it's about like, you know, like I've, you know, I have spoken many times and still

**01:14:08** try to get my feelings out on this.

**01:14:10** And it's complicated about like what it is to be human and human creativity and stuff

**01:14:15** like that, where I feel like these models, it's really hard.

**01:14:19** It's like these models, what they're doing is it's less impressive to me.

**01:14:25** It feels more what anyone could do in a sense of like not like that story is a standout.

**01:14:32** Right. But like a lot of the things that I've

**01:14:35** seen myself and other examples that I've seen around again, they feel very much like

**01:14:40** spend an hour on Google and you could probably come out with something like this

**01:14:44** yourself, right? Like there is that kind of feeling to it.

**01:14:48** But like something like Dali, some same companies, by the way, in case you don't

**01:14:52** know, it's all from OpenAI. These two, Dali and chat GPT come from one

**01:14:56** company called OpenAI. What Dali is doing is something that the

**01:15:01** average person could not do.

**01:15:03** But what chat GPT is doing, I think the

**01:15:06** average person could do with the same input, right?

**01:15:11** Like you could look at a thousand images and could not paint a painting to the

**01:15:16** skill of Dali, but you could read a thousand articles and could probably turn

**01:15:20** something out and that's close to what chat GPT can do.

**01:15:23** I don't know how that makes me feel, but that's just how I feel in looking at them.

**01:15:27** But I can't really express why I don't have this existential dread feeling about

**01:15:33** chat GPT like I do about Dali.

**01:15:35** But I don't know why that is the case.

**01:15:39** Well, I suggest like a thing to think about that people underrate in economic

**01:15:45** change. So I think chat GPT is currently in the phase of people are doing the thing

**01:15:52** where they overestimate the change in the short term, but they underestimate the

**01:15:56** change in the long term, which is like just a general phenomenon that always

**01:15:59** happens. Everybody does that.

**01:16:01** I do that when you see like a new tech demo.

**01:16:05** I think one of the questions to often ask about how impactful will this be is the

**01:16:12** question of if it makes something significantly faster or cheaper, not

**01:16:17** necessarily like does it do a new thing?

**01:16:20** And if it does an existing thing much faster and cheaper, you can like

**01:16:26** rate higher in your mind the chance that this is going to have a big impact.

**01:16:30** And so when you keep saying like, oh, this is what a person could do by reading a

**01:16:34** bunch of articles on Google and writing something up, I don't disagree with you

**01:16:37** that for tons of stuff that is totally true.

**01:16:40** But the game changer here is that it's so much faster.

**01:16:44** Yeah, but it ain't cheaper.

**01:16:46** Well, it's not cheaper for open AI to be

**01:16:48** running, but it's cheaper for people to use.

**01:16:51** And I still think it's cheaper at scale.

**01:16:54** Like even if you I mean, just based on some of the art stuff, like

**01:16:59** signing up for those paid services, it's still like much cheaper at scale, even if

**01:17:04** the cost of running the servers for the individual company is quite large.

**01:17:08** But so this is just where like when I

**01:17:10** think of the death of homework, the big deal of this is that

**01:17:13** chat GPT can do 80 percent of your work in seconds and then you can spend an hour

**01:17:20** tidying up all of your homework assignments instead of spending many

**01:17:24** hours working on all of them or I had the interesting phenomenon of coming across.

**01:17:32** I was on Hacker News just like reading a bunch of the articles that were linked

**01:17:35** to the discussion site like Reddit and there was an article that was kind of weird.

**01:17:40** And I went back into the chat and it's like, oh, this was an article that was

**01:17:45** written by chat GPT. It's like the first time that it happened

**01:17:49** where I came across like some website that like contracts out articles had one

**01:17:53** that was written by chat GPT.

**01:17:56** And what I thought was very funny and very weird was that the author showed up

**01:18:01** in the comments and was like, oh, hey, yeah, I'm the guy who wrote this article.

**01:18:06** Yes, I used chat GPT, but all of the ideas were mine.

**01:18:12** I just prompted chat GPT to get the words right.

**01:18:16** It was very strange.

**01:18:18** I thought like, oh, it's the first time I've come across this.

**01:18:20** Like, here's an article that's written by chat GPT.

**01:18:23** And I'm going to disagree with the person that they wrote that article.

**01:18:27** I think the very concept of like the ideas in the article are mine,

**01:18:31** but I didn't write it is hilarious.

**01:18:33** But nonetheless, that person could have a huge output of articles

**01:18:39** in like a much faster time scale with the with the assistance of something

**01:18:43** like chat GPT, even if they're going through and like editing it afterwards.

**01:18:47** So this is seen at right.

**01:18:48** I saw some headlines about this.

**01:18:50** So so that's like one area that's quite interesting.

**01:18:55** And one of the other things that I'm going to be curious to see what happens

**01:18:59** with this is when I had been talking to some people behind the scenes who were

**01:19:03** working on systems like this, like language model systems,

**01:19:06** one of the things I was really surprised to hear is the number of people who said

**01:19:11** that they were using this as their search engine, that they had given up using

**01:19:16** Google and instead were using their own language models as a kind of Google.

**01:19:21** And that's why I think one of the there was like the constraints that that opening

**01:19:26** has put on chat GPT is they're like, they can't know anything about the way

**01:19:29** that the world currently exists.

**01:19:30** It doesn't know anything about what's happened since like 2020 or whatever.

**01:19:34** Like they've really limited any concept for it of like what the world currently is.

**01:19:40** Of course, that is the public facing side.

**01:19:43** You know, back when it was first launched, people could totally trick it of like,

**01:19:46** oh, no, you know, for open AI, 100 percent knows about the current world.

**01:19:50** They're just not letting people play with that.

**01:19:52** But yeah, like this kind of stuff could be super useful in search engines.

**01:19:57** And like I was very surprised when I was

**01:19:59** talking to people to hear that that they were using it as a search engine.

**01:20:02** But having played around with it a bit, it won't replace my Google, I think,

**01:20:07** for right now. But there's definitely been a couple of times where I've had

**01:20:10** questions that I would put in the variety of I'm not exactly sure what I'm asking.

**01:20:16** But can you direct me in the right down the right path here?

**01:20:19** Or like, I just don't have any of the words for this thing.

**01:20:22** But if I can just describe the situation,

**01:20:24** can you tell me like what the words are that I should be Googling for?

**01:20:28** And chat is already really good at that.

**01:20:31** And it just saw the headline.

**01:20:33** But apparently Microsoft is looking to do some kind of ten billion dollar investment,

**01:20:37** perhaps in chat GPT to incorporate it into Bing so that they can have that as a search

**01:20:43** engine thing. And like, that's another area where I think, man, on the short term,

**01:20:48** if that happens, it could be quite useful as a tool for kind of helping people use

**01:20:54** search engines the way they want to use search engines.

**01:20:57** Like, I think people want to use search engines like it's a very knowledgeable

**01:21:01** reference librarian like, hey, I'm looking for a thing about this.

**01:21:04** Can you help me out with that?

**01:21:05** And chat GPT can totally do that right now.

**01:21:08** So we'll see where this stuff goes.

**01:21:10** The Microsoft thing is really interesting, like, because OpenAI is using Azure,

**01:21:15** I think, and this deal, apparently, that's going around as we're recording this,

**01:21:23** it ends up with like Microsoft would end up eventually owning a large chunk of OpenAI

**01:21:30** if they go through with it. It's really intriguing.

**01:21:33** I mean, it's clearly Microsoft are like, we would like Bing to be better.

**01:21:38** There is also apparently rumblings around Silicon Valley that Google believes that

**01:21:43** it has better tools, but it's too scared to put them out.

**01:21:46** Like of both image generation and text

**01:21:50** generation, which I 100 percent believe that they would like if anyone's going to

**01:21:55** be able to do this, Google should be the company in theory, right?

**01:21:59** With like the immense data sets that they have and the human trained,

**01:22:06** effectively, AI that they've generated over time.

**01:22:08** Right. Where like you search for a thing and click on the thing that you want.

**01:22:12** That is positive training for Google.

**01:22:16** But apparently Google is concerned about

**01:22:20** the public perception of the quality of their tools.

**01:22:25** For like this similar thing, what you're talking about, what OpenAI did is like,

**01:22:28** we need to put some barriers around this thing.

**01:22:32** Yeah, that's Google's concern.

**01:22:35** Yeah, I mean, I would say even I found that first day with OpenAI,

**01:22:41** I was a bit like, this feels reckless.

**01:22:43** This this.

**01:22:45** This feels like a bad decision or I don't know, I was I was just really kind of

**01:22:49** wondering what's going on over there, like what was the what was the conversation?

**01:22:55** But there was some real wacky stuff when people were really trying to

**01:22:59** break around the system where you could see little parts of it.

**01:23:02** I think the most alarming one that I came across was people found that you could

**01:23:07** prompt it to be able to express the idea of working with Amazon Web Services.

**01:23:12** So I was like, oh,

**01:23:14** chat GPT knows the correct code for interfacing with Amazon Web Services.

**01:23:19** I was like, oh, I don't like that at all.

**01:23:22** That seems like, oh, please not.

**01:23:25** Like, let's not let's not have an AI system that that knows how to do that.

**01:23:29** That's a real bad idea, guys.

**01:23:31** I mean, look, I'm just if I had to place money on it, I would for sure place money

**01:23:36** on Google has the best system, but that doesn't necessarily mean they have the

**01:23:39** most public facing system.

**01:23:41** It would be quite a surprise if someone else was able to be doing better than Google

**01:23:45** was, like you said, given the just absurd

**01:23:48** amount of computing power and data that they have at their hands, it would.

**01:23:53** I feel like Google would have had to drop

**01:23:55** the ball quite badly to not internally have something that's doing really well on

**01:24:00** this front.

**01:24:01** But yeah,

**01:24:03** I think a lot has happened since October.

**01:24:08** I don't even know how I feel about this stuff anymore.

**01:24:11** Like, I think I've been like ground down now over time.

**01:24:16** I'm sorry, Mike.

**01:24:17** I have ground you down with the AI.

**01:24:19** I do apologize for that.

**01:24:21** It's not you.

**01:24:22** It's it's the Internet.

**01:24:24** Because I didn't need to have these

**01:24:26** conversations with you to know this stuff was happening.

**01:24:28** You know what I mean?

**01:24:29** Yeah, we started talking about it because it was just bubbling up and becoming

**01:24:33** impossible not to notice and it just it was just the timing of everything exploded.

**01:24:37** And I think that the most explosive thing that could possibly have happened between

**01:24:41** the last time we spoke and now did happen, which was a massive public

**01:24:45** demonstration of look at what language models can do, just like the art stuff.

**01:24:50** This is only going one way, which is better and better.

**01:24:53** One day, Mike, we'll have to have the conversation that goes all the way down

**01:24:57** to the atoms of AI.

**01:26:37** I spent a little bit of time recently revamping my personal website, Mike Hurley

**01:26:41** dot net, which is on Squarespace because I wanted to make sure that I had a really

**01:26:44** good landing page of people could come to.

**01:26:46** They could see all the things that I'm working on, the podcast, the projects,

**01:26:50** that kind of stuff.

**01:26:51** Super easy to do.

**01:26:52** I just say, oh, I want to do this.

**01:26:53** And then within an hour or so, I'd redesign my entire website.

**01:27:24** So another pretty big thing that since we last spoke is that I have left Twitter.

**01:27:29** Left left?

**01:27:30** What is what is left mean, Mike?

**01:27:32** My account exists.

**01:27:34** OK, I don't look at it.

**01:27:36** I don't look at the timeline.

**01:27:38** I don't look at my replies.

**01:27:39** Logged out of everywhere, apps deleted and everything.

**01:27:42** Does your do you still post stuff?

**01:27:45** Is there like OK?

**01:27:47** The only posting that I do

**01:27:50** manually is to the Cortex account.

**01:27:53** OK, I can't load Twitter on this computer.

**01:27:56** Did you have a dramatic I left Twitter tweet?

**01:27:58** Is your final tweet or kind of?

**01:28:00** OK, but I don't think it was dramatic.

**01:28:03** Let me read it to you because I was actually pretty proud of it.

**01:28:06** I just wanted to say it's time for me to put my attention elsewhere,

**01:28:09** like find my shows, find my products, streaming, Instagram links.

**01:28:13** I said, or wherever you get your podcasts or wherever you get your

**01:28:17** podcasts, I like that, but it's good because that's the joke, right?

**01:28:20** Like find us wherever you get your podcasts.

**01:28:22** So I thought that that would be and then that's it.

**01:28:25** That was my last tweet. I like that.

**01:28:26** That's a very good last tweet.

**01:28:27** I think you're right to be proud of that.

**01:28:29** Yeah, I didn't want to make it like a whole big thing, like a whole big

**01:28:32** political thing, but I wanted to be able to pin a tweet which had all of my places.

**01:28:37** Right. So that was what I did.

**01:28:39** And yeah, it's been a month.

**01:28:40** OK,

**01:28:42** so

**01:28:44** this is very interesting to me.

**01:28:46** What are your reasons for for leaving?

**01:28:48** Like what was the

**01:28:50** I don't know if this is correct to say, but I feel like you've had a on again,

**01:28:55** off again relationship with Twitter over the years.

**01:28:57** Pinning that tweet feels more definitive than things in the past.

**01:29:04** So I'm just I'm just kind of curious, like what what motivated this?

**01:29:08** Like what was your reasoning for doing this?

**01:29:10** Well, realistically, my on again, off again has only been in my feelings.

**01:29:13** Like I've never changed my approach to it as such.

**01:29:17** Like, yeah, that is what I meant.

**01:29:19** Like when I talk to you about things, like what is the what's the barometer

**01:29:25** of Twitter in Mike's brain right now has not been a consistent reading over the years.

**01:29:30** No, I feel like that there has been a downward trend.

**01:29:33** My reasons are threefold for why now.

**01:29:36** So one, since Elon Musk took over, the service is taking a nosedive in things

**01:29:41** that frustrate me, I think a lot of the product decisions are weird.

**01:29:46** I don't like some of the advertising changes.

**01:29:48** I don't like this sense of like

**01:29:52** extortion that I feel like is taking over on Twitter.

**01:29:56** It's like you've been verified for a long time for whatever reason.

**01:29:59** And now we want to start charging you for it.

**01:30:01** It's a little things like that have been grating on me.

**01:30:03** Like that's part one.

**01:30:05** That wouldn't have been enough if it wasn't for the other things I feel like.

**01:30:10** So well, also, I don't like some of the

**01:30:12** policy decisions that have been made for people that are being brought back onto

**01:30:16** the service, but I don't really need to get into that more than that point.

**01:30:19** I am frustrated.

**01:30:22** Actually, point one two is like it's just annoying to be on Twitter and like was

**01:30:27** annoying to me to be in Twitter and all anyone wanted to talk about was Elon Musk.

**01:30:30** Like I just found that frustrating.

**01:30:32** Like it just wasn't fun.

**01:30:35** It was just really annoying.

**01:30:36** And all anyone wanted to talk about was

**01:30:38** Twitter and Elon Musk and it's just like, I'm not really interested in that.

**01:30:43** Like, and it was just frustrating to me.

**01:30:44** Twitter is at its worst when it turns its eye upon itself and then just wants to talk

**01:30:50** about Twitter. And this is the longest I've ever seen that happen.

**01:30:53** It's just been constant and it's just annoying.

**01:30:57** And like, I don't need that in my life.

**01:31:00** Right. That's point.

**01:31:01** It's really it strikes me as really tiresomely self-involved.

**01:31:06** Like, yeah.

**01:31:07** Point two.

**01:31:09** So many of my friends, people whose work I enjoy as well, have left Twitter.

**01:31:15** So if I sign in, my timeline wouldn't be as fun anyway.

**01:31:20** So like what was happening is I was feeling these things of point one of like,

**01:31:24** this isn't fun to be on anymore.

**01:31:26** I don't agree with the decisions they're making.

**01:31:29** I don't agree with the moderation changes they're making.

**01:31:31** Like that stuff was grating on me.

**01:31:34** But I was like, but this is a community, right?

**01:31:36** Like I'm part of this community.

**01:31:39** I'm separating the platform from the people and it's the people that I want to read.

**01:31:43** Well, then they all started leaving.

**01:31:45** So it's like, all right, I've got a lot to hold on to here.

**01:31:48** But then point three is the biggest one for me.

**01:31:51** I have wanted to do this for years for my own mental health.

**01:31:56** And I've finally done it.

**01:31:59** Like point one and two gave me the cover

**01:32:03** to do the thing that I've wanted to do, which is leave Twitter hilariously for me.

**01:32:09** This is the first theme in years where I did not try and shoehorn this in as a part

**01:32:13** of it, and it's the one that I actually did it on.

**01:32:15** You know, I've had these things of like changing my approach to the Internet and

**01:32:19** all that kind of stuff. And a lot of it was for getting away from Twitter.

**01:32:23** And there's a couple of reasons for this.

**01:32:25** One, Twitter's timeline is like typically a not fun place to be

**01:32:32** because it's like full of people being angry about things all the time.

**01:32:37** And whether that anger is warranted or not is not the point.

**01:32:41** It's like, how much of my day do I want to spend

**01:32:45** ingesting the anger of people? Right.

**01:32:49** That had an overall negative effect on me where it was like surprise,

**01:32:55** you know, like I'm going on Twitter for whatever reason and surprise atrocity.

**01:32:59** You know, like that wasn't necessarily what I was going for at that moment.

**01:33:04** Similarly.

**01:33:08** The way that people react, like the way that people can be to people online.

**01:33:14** So like I would sometimes be on Twitter and then someone would just start being

**01:33:18** randomly nasty to me for like seemingly no reason.

**01:33:21** And I don't and it's like a similar thing of like that didn't play well for me,

**01:33:26** of like the surprise of it, you know, and that surprise over time morphed into dread.

**01:33:34** So like I would open the Twitter app and be like, all right, here we go.

**01:33:38** Even if there was nothing happening.

**01:33:40** So like these behaviors ended up creating this cycle of

**01:33:45** expecting it and being surprised by it.

**01:33:48** And like that just wasn't good for me.

**01:33:50** So time to leave it behind.

**01:33:54** This is why like reason three is why unlike many people, I am not replacing my

**01:34:00** Twitter usage of Mastodon or any other service like that.

**01:34:03** So this kind of social media for me, this like text based short posting social media

**01:34:09** where people anyone in the world can get in touch with me or I can get in touch with

**01:34:13** anyone in the world, like send the messages or read what anyone's got to say.

**01:34:17** That's gone.

**01:34:18** Like I want to see what my life is like

**01:34:21** without this endless stream of thoughts and opinions and news all the time from

**01:34:26** everywhere. So that's where I am.

**01:34:29** When you say that the first two points about like the current changes with Twitter,

**01:34:33** how they're like how they're acting as cover for the actual thing.

**01:34:37** Point three about your mental health.

**01:34:39** Like what do you mean by what do you mean by that?

**01:34:40** What do you mean by cover?

**01:34:41** So there's two things going on.

**01:34:43** One is I needed something to push me like I needed an excuse to do it.

**01:34:49** Right. Because nothing was changing.

**01:34:51** It had to be me that all of a sudden made that change all on my own.

**01:34:55** Right. Which was not easy for me to do.

**01:34:59** In the other words, well, I always felt like my community expected me to be there.

**01:35:05** Like listeners expected me to be there.

**01:35:08** So I didn't want to be like, oh, it's time for me to leave everyone, you know, like

**01:35:14** the blue I felt like.

**01:35:16** And we're going to get I want to talk about this a little bit more in general.

**01:35:19** But I would have felt like I was like better than everyone else.

**01:35:24** It was like this feeling of like, no, I'm leaving Twitter now.

**01:35:27** Like this service, it would have felt weird to me.

**01:35:31** I can't explain it fully.

**01:35:32** There's like this relevance thing that's bubbling around in my brain anyway that I

**01:35:36** want to talk about.

**01:35:37** But like I feel like if I would have just left Twitter, it would have kind of

**01:35:42** been a sign that I didn't want to hear from people at all.

**01:35:47** Do you mean that in the sense that you think that's how people would have

**01:35:51** interpreted it? Yes. OK.

**01:35:53** Yeah, I was worried that people would have thought of me that way.

**01:35:56** Right. Not that it's actually the case.

**01:35:58** That's how you're worried people wouldn't.

**01:36:01** OK. All right.

**01:36:01** I was like, who on earth ever thinks that someone's like, oh, I'm better than you

**01:36:04** by leaving Twitter. But that's your concern, is that that's how the audience

**01:36:09** might react to something like that.

**01:36:12** That like because I had always been and was always very like

**01:36:16** proud of especially all in my career about being approachable.

**01:36:20** And like it is something that's important to me.

**01:36:22** And I always loved that that was something that I could do that like people could ask

**01:36:26** me questions and I could answer them and stuff like that.

**01:36:29** But the problem was in doing that, as the world changed, the type of things that would

**01:36:35** be sent to me changed and.

**01:36:38** The tone was different and things could get weird.

**01:36:40** And it just ended up being not as nice as it used to be.

**01:36:44** It was kind of like whether people would feel that way,

**01:36:47** it wouldn't feel that way. It wasn't the thing.

**01:36:48** It was like a thing in my brain.

**01:36:50** I didn't want to come off as being this like unapproachable person or like I didn't

**01:36:55** want to come off as being like, oh, like you can't know you can't get in touch with

**01:37:00** me on Twitter, so I'm just going to leave.

**01:37:02** But in so many people leaving.

**01:37:05** It's given me the opportunity to try this because I feel like enough people

**01:37:10** understand the halfway point now, which is I've left Twitter like so many people

**01:37:15** have, right? But what I'm not doing is replacing it

**01:37:18** with something else because I want to try and live my life without this thing.

**01:37:26** Yeah, it doesn't matter now, but this is one of those cases where I just wonder how

**01:37:31** much.

**01:37:33** That worry of the audience interpretation

**01:37:36** of your actions is a would have been a real thing or not.

**01:37:41** But I get what you mean that if this is a move that you have been eyeing up now is

**01:37:47** an excellent time to make that move because you're not going to get pushback.

**01:37:52** Because I feel like people can understand at least part of it, right?

**01:37:55** Even if they don't get all of it, there would have been two parts before of like,

**01:37:59** why do you want to leave Twitter and why don't you want to be on this social media?

**01:38:02** Well, now it's just why don't you want to be in the social media,

**01:38:05** which is half of the thing, right?

**01:38:07** It's like it feels like there is it's easy to understand why I don't want to be on

**01:38:11** Twitter like a lot of people in our community understand that now,

**01:38:15** not everyone. And that's fine.

**01:38:16** And like I'm not judging other people.

**01:38:18** Right. Like this is not a yardstick for everyone, even my fellow creators.

**01:38:24** Right. Like if this is a thing that's good

**01:38:27** for you and like mentally go for it, for me, it isn't like it's just not.

**01:38:32** It is bad on my mental health to.

**01:38:38** And it's not even like that I was like being barraged by haters constantly.

**01:38:42** No, no, no. But like I'm totally on board with this.

**01:38:45** Right. To me, this lines up with a lot of my feelings always about like the news.

**01:38:51** Right. Which even now, like the very concept of what is bounded within those two

**01:38:56** words has wildly changed since we started talking on this podcast years ago.

**01:38:59** Because like Twitter is functionally a

**01:39:01** newsfeed in a way that it like sort of wasn't at the dawn.

**01:39:06** But it's the same thing of there's a variance in the interruption of your day.

**01:39:13** And why would you want that?

**01:39:15** Or like you need a really good positive upside if there's a thing that can just

**01:39:22** derail your day randomly at any moment.

**01:39:27** That's it.

**01:39:27** Yeah. And like this is something that I am

**01:39:30** aware of with people who really follow the news where you can see that like some

**01:39:36** thing in the news has totally derailed them in a way that just doesn't make sense

**01:39:42** to the scale of its impact on their life.

**01:39:45** And it's just as an outside observer, it's a bit like you don't have you don't have

**01:39:50** to do that.

**01:39:51** You don't have to roll the dice randomly for you're going to get derailed for a

**01:39:58** thing that either doesn't affect you or that you are unable to affect in many ways.

**01:40:05** So like when you just said thereof, you

**01:40:08** started to get the feeling of opening Twitter and like, all right, you know,

**01:40:11** what's it going to be today? Am I going to find out some horrible piece of news or

**01:40:16** like I'm just going to get swept up in whatever the Internet is angry about

**01:40:20** right now? And like with 24 hour news where it's a bit like, oh, how mysterious.

**01:40:27** There's always news 24 hours a day.

**01:40:30** It's like on Twitter, there's some standard amount of anger and it's like

**01:40:36** sometimes that anger is focused on very just things.

**01:40:41** But it's like there needs to be a certain level of anger always.

**01:40:45** And if there's nothing just to get angry

**01:40:48** about, it'll be something ridiculous that people will just like everyone's angry

**01:40:53** about this right now. And so you can like you can easily get

**01:40:56** swept up in whatever the current angry thing is.

**01:41:00** And then also like being a person on the Internet, you do have the issue of just

**01:41:06** running into someone is really angry at you about something.

**01:41:11** And again, like maybe they have a good reason.

**01:41:13** Maybe they don't.

**01:41:15** But you're just rolling the dice every time you open up Twitter.

**01:41:19** So like I'm totally on board with all of those as like very excellent reasons to

**01:41:25** want to leave the service. Like you're not you're not going to get any pushback for me.

**01:41:29** It's not you that I'm worried about.

**01:41:31** Right.

**01:41:33** Oh, you weren't.

**01:41:34** It wasn't me that you were concerned was going to berate you on the podcast.

**01:41:37** I felt like if there's one person in the world that knows it's you because you did

**01:41:42** it right. You did it in the most extreme way.

**01:41:45** There is a feeling that I have which

**01:41:48** is expanding in different directions and I'm working on is being out of touch.

**01:41:54** I was literally about to make the joke like, but Mike, aren't you worried about

**01:41:59** being out of touch? Because that's what everybody says.

**01:42:02** And I always find that kind of hilarious.

**01:42:04** But that is what I'm worried about.

**01:42:05** And it comes in two directions.

**01:42:07** It comes in one.

**01:42:07** People hear me say these things and like, oh, you're better than everyone else.

**01:42:12** I still feel like that's a weird thing in your head.

**01:42:14** I just can't imagine any reasonable person having that kind of response.

**01:42:18** But but it's not.

**01:42:20** But yet I agree with you.

**01:42:22** Right. But this is the thing is like the people that were making things

**01:42:27** difficult for me were the unreasonable people anyway.

**01:42:30** Yeah. Yeah. By definition.

**01:42:31** Right. Reasonable people weren't the people

**01:42:34** that made it difficult for me to go on to Twitter sometimes.

**01:42:37** Right. Because, you know, a handful of times a month,

**01:42:40** I'd be dealing with an unreasonable person and that would destroy a day for me.

**01:42:45** Yeah. You know, like someone would decide

**01:42:47** that they wanted to make fun of the way I pronounce words in a day.

**01:42:51** And like that will stick in my mind for weeks.

**01:42:53** Right. And like, I don't want that when I don't need to have that.

**01:42:58** And like and I don't need Twitter.

**01:43:00** So it's like an easy thing for me to just get rid of.

**01:43:03** Right. Like this is where I ended up.

**01:43:05** But the concern I have is like people like, oh, you're

**01:43:09** you what you're so you're better than us.

**01:43:12** Right. But that's one part.

**01:43:14** Whatever I deal with that.

**01:43:15** Like I don't need to appease two unreasonable people.

**01:43:19** The thing that I'm more worried about is that.

**01:43:24** Either I will lose track of the things that people were talking about.

**01:43:31** Or people will think I have.

**01:43:34** So I will use, say, for example, I'll use my Apple focus shows.

**01:43:39** Right for this. Yeah.

**01:43:40** Because they're more news focused.

**01:43:42** What's going on? What's the conversation of the day?

**01:43:45** What are people focusing on? Right.

**01:43:47** That is more of a concern for me that either a I'm not in tune with what the Apple

**01:43:52** community is thinking and talking about, or people think that I'm not because I

**01:43:57** have a differing opinion and I'm not on mastodon.

**01:44:00** When if I was on mastodon, they may just think I have a differing opinion.

**01:44:04** But I'm still informed.

**01:44:08** Now, the perception part, I kind of can't do anything about that.

**01:44:11** Right. There's like people are going to think that about me or not.

**01:44:14** The actually staying in touch part, I am working on that.

**01:44:19** So I've increased the amount of websites and blogs or in my RSS.

**01:44:25** So like I'm able to bring in more opinions.

**01:44:27** And I've also got like a few people who I think are like taste makers or some of the

**01:44:34** louder voices in the community.

**01:44:36** I have put their mastodon feeds into my RSS reader.

**01:44:41** So if I ever want they're in a folder called vibe check.

**01:44:45** So if I ever want to see what the vibe is.

**01:44:48** I feel like I can go to this folder and can have a quick scan through it.

**01:44:52** But I don't read that like I would read Twitter.

**01:44:54** It's like a way to inform like there's a big there's like a bunch of news coming out.

**01:44:59** Let me go and check the vibe check folder

**01:45:01** and reader and see like what are people kind of saying about this?

**01:45:08** So this is kind of a thing that I'm trying to do to balance it right now.

**01:45:17** And I have a lot of thoughts, but it's like it's hard to articulate.

**01:45:20** I like.

**01:45:23** So you're in an interesting position where

**01:45:26** you have many shows in which you are talking much more about topical things

**01:45:29** or like what is currently happening.

**01:45:32** And I just I feel like the problem of.

**01:45:36** The problem of staying informed is I feel like it's barely a problem.

**01:45:41** The whole thing with the modern world is like selection.

**01:45:48** It's it's not about finding a thing.

**01:45:52** So, you know,

**01:45:56** I think it's always been the case that a person with some well selected RSS feeds

**01:46:03** can be very adequately up to date on anything they care to because some RSS

**01:46:11** feeds are already a million times better than technologies were for trying to keep

**01:46:17** in touch with what's going on. So I just like I just don't perceive

**01:46:21** the problem of like, oh, I need to stay in touch as an actual problem.

**01:46:25** I think what people are worried about is.

**01:46:30** A kind of confusion with volume of consumption as proportional to amount

**01:46:37** of staying in touch, and I just don't think that that's the case.

**01:46:41** I think that's like a perception problem.

**01:46:43** You're not more in touch if you've heard about a thing seven times.

**01:46:48** You're just as in touch as if you heard about it once, like through one cleverly

**01:46:52** selected RSS feed.

**01:46:53** So I just I can't conceive that you will actually lose touch in any way.

**01:47:00** And it's really funny because you having a folder called Vibe Check, to me, it's

**01:47:04** like, oh, that feels like Mike is still too in touch.

**01:47:09** That's kind of my initial response to that.

**01:47:11** It's like, oh, I would prefer a Mike who

**01:47:12** was more out of touch and didn't feel the need to have like a Vibe Check folder.

**01:47:16** But I can totally understand that as a transition away from Twitter.

**01:47:20** I'm like, oh, maybe what's a Twitter or I was going to say a Twitter like thing,

**01:47:25** but it's actually different.

**01:47:26** It's more like what is a way to extract what you think is the value in Twitter

**01:47:32** without having that as a tool.

**01:47:34** I'm kind of using it like the like micro

**01:47:36** blogs, really, because I don't ever read what people are saying in response to these

**01:47:41** tweets. I don't see in this the responses people send.

**01:47:45** These are purely the tweet that they call them to which I just think is ridiculous.

**01:47:50** Toots, I know, toots to their audiences.

**01:47:54** Awful.

**01:47:55** There's a lot about Masterdom that just doesn't vibe with me as well, like

**01:48:00** which is part of why it was so easy for me not to move.

**01:48:04** But I think it I don't care how many videos there are.

**01:48:07** I find it confusing, like the overall structure of it.

**01:48:10** I find the URLs complicated.

**01:48:13** Like there's a lot of it that I don't like.

**01:48:15** There's also something which is really funny to me that a lot of people left

**01:48:18** Twitter because they don't like this one guy who's controlling it.

**01:48:22** But Mastodon inherently, like the way it is built as Mastodon,

**01:48:25** is one person's decision about the way that the service works.

**01:48:28** It's just all very funny to me, but I'm just not interested in it.

**01:48:31** Also, I just I know literally nothing about Mastodon, but just the very fact

**01:48:36** that they want to call them toots, it's like, oh, my God,

**01:48:39** you guys are setting up roadblocks for yourself.

**01:48:41** You don't need to for mass adoption of this thing.

**01:48:44** I don't don't pick unappealing words

**01:48:47** just because you think they're funny.

**01:48:49** Tweet was bad enough.

**01:48:51** Tweet at least tweet had the advantage of being cute.

**01:48:55** Yeah.

**01:48:56** And conceptually aligned with it's a bird.

**01:48:59** And what do birds do?

**01:49:00** They tweet.

**01:49:02** Mastodon's toot.

**01:49:04** OK.

**01:49:05** I think the idea is it's meant to be like the sound they would make from their

**01:49:09** trunks, right. But like, yeah, that's not what people think about it.

**01:49:14** And I actually don't think I believe it was originally pitched

**01:49:17** as a joke, but then was adopted as the official nomenclature for the service.

**01:49:22** Wow, that's really regrettable, Mastodon.

**01:49:25** Bad decision.

**01:49:26** I think a lot of the decisions about Mastodon are regrettable personally.

**01:49:30** But I'm happy that like.

**01:49:34** The tech community has found a new home for itself.

**01:49:38** Yeah, right.

**01:49:39** I am very pleased that there is something that people are excited about and are

**01:49:44** going ahead and using, like, because it would have been really sad for me if like

**01:49:50** people didn't want to be on Twitter anymore, but had nowhere to go.

**01:49:53** And I'm happy that people have somewhere to go.

**01:49:56** I've just decided that I don't want to go to it right now.

**01:50:00** And like there are things that are helping me.

**01:50:02** Like I don't feel like I need it so much because I use Discord so much now.

**01:50:07** Private Discord, public Discord, like that is like a

**01:50:10** is a much better place for me and for what I'm looking for.

**01:50:14** And the types of communication and conversations that I'm having.

**01:50:17** Also, what I didn't want to do from this is

**01:50:20** I don't want to make it that I've completely shut down any type of free

**01:50:26** feedback to me or the shows, right, that like people can't send in questions to me

**01:50:32** anymore, they can't send in like general follow up.

**01:50:36** And so because, you know, a lot of that stuff can come in through our members

**01:50:40** Discord, but I didn't want to make that the only way that people could send stuff

**01:50:44** in. So there is now on the real AMP website,

**01:50:47** there is a feedback button.

**01:50:50** And people can get it from this show or they can go to Cortex feedback.com and they

**01:50:53** can send in questions like ask Cortex questions can come in that way, for example.

**01:50:57** So that's on our website.

**01:50:59** Now we built that it goes into our own CMS.

**01:51:02** It's like a tool that we're building so we can collect follow up and feedback.

**01:51:06** Oh, I didn't know that.

**01:51:07** We just put it live like a couple of weeks ago.

**01:51:10** It's it's an early version of what we will

**01:51:12** want this to be because as well, my co-founder Stephen has also left Twitter

**01:51:16** and is also not a mastodon.

**01:51:18** So I didn't know that.

**01:51:20** Yeah. And so we're very much like, all right,

**01:51:23** we need to work something out because I was starting to realize that, like, you

**01:51:27** know, submissions of questions and stuff has always been a thing on this show and

**01:51:32** many shows, and I don't want it to be that the only way you can get in contact

**01:51:37** with us is to become a member like there's just something wrong about that.

**01:51:41** So this is now like free, open feedback form that anyone can put their info in.

**01:51:46** And so far it's been live for a couple of weeks on some shows.

**01:51:49** I'm very happy with this as a as a system.

**01:51:52** It works great.

**01:51:53** So I presume the format is the same for all the shows.

**01:51:56** So it's really dot fm slash show name slash feedback.

**01:52:00** Yeah. Is that like just a generic thing for all the shows?

**01:52:02** That's a really good idea for the shows that have opted in.

**01:52:04** It is an opt in thing for each show.

**01:52:06** OK. Does not everyone.

**01:52:07** Some people are just still very active on

**01:52:09** Macedon so they don't need to want this and they want this stuff on Macedon or

**01:52:12** Twitter or whatever. Yeah, this is something because as well.

**01:52:16** What's great about this is not email.

**01:52:17** So it's going into a specific place and it's character limited.

**01:52:21** Oh, I see. Right.

**01:52:22** So this is the type of way that I want my feedback for my shows.

**01:52:26** And I like to see it so far, like the feedback is high quality and good and

**01:52:32** helpful and like this is the kind of stuff that I want because as well,

**01:52:35** it's like feedback I would get by email while too long.

**01:52:39** Even if someone was mad at me, it was always better than a tweet.

**01:52:42** Yeah. Well, before you mentioned that you built this system for Relay,

**01:52:46** which I think is great, I was going to say like this again,

**01:52:49** the concept of being out of touch or like the concept of not being able to get

**01:52:53** feedback, it's like emails existed for a really long time.

**01:52:57** That's totally a thing that you can do.

**01:52:59** And there's a weird way in which email,

**01:53:04** which used to be the low effort way to get in touch,

**01:53:07** has now become the higher effort way to get in touch compared to things like

**01:53:11** Twitter. And I do think even with like the feedback forms on Relay,

**01:53:17** I think there's a big advantage in putting up a very small but not zero

**01:53:23** hurdle for people to get in touch.

**01:53:26** And when you say Twitter has changed and like changed the way that you felt about

**01:53:31** it over time, it's totally a function of just absolutely.

**01:53:36** Everybody has gone there and it's just such a such a low effort way to respond

**01:53:42** to people. And so, well, yeah, of course, like it's a kind of selection effect.

**01:53:46** If you massively increase the number of people who are there and also never

**01:53:52** increase the difficulty of getting in touch with anyone, well,

**01:53:57** of course, the average content is going to go down.

**01:54:00** I feel like this is this is the lesson that older me would try to impart on younger me

**01:54:06** when he just he just never considered the selection effect of like, oh, hey, hey,

**01:54:13** kid, the Internet seems like utopia because it's just a very small number of people

**01:54:19** who are here. But like, think through what's going to

**01:54:22** happen when everyone shows up and like really internalize what everyone means.

**01:54:28** It's like it's not going to seem so great

**01:54:30** then like, you know, what what happens with huge groups of people?

**01:54:34** And that's kind of like the Twitter effect.

**01:54:36** It's just as it's gotten larger and larger, the average quality has gone way down.

**01:54:41** So I'm hugely in favor of this kind of thing of like, you still want feedback

**01:54:46** from people who listen to your shows. Tell them like relay dot FM slash cortex

**01:54:50** slash feedback. Like that's a great place to send feedback.

**01:54:52** Or even better is cortex feedback dot com goes to the same place.

**01:54:56** Cortex feedback dot com.

**01:54:57** Just a nice domain.

**01:54:58** Yeah, that is nice domain.

**01:55:00** And that that's great.

**01:55:01** And it's just a little bit of hesitation where someone who just is having a bad day

**01:55:10** and like wants to be mean on Twitter can do that real easy when they just see you

**01:55:14** tweet anything and they're on Twitter and it's like takes two seconds.

**01:55:18** Whereas this is more intentional.

**01:55:21** And I would expect that increases the quality of the positive and the negative

**01:55:25** feedback, like the negative feedback, kind of like you were just saying about

**01:55:29** how it's been higher quality, negative feedback through email.

**01:55:33** Then compared to Twitter.

**01:55:34** So I don't see any kind of stay in touch problem at all, Mike.

**01:55:38** We'll say, I mean, you are maybe not the right person to judge that.

**01:55:42** I am 100 percent the right person to judge this.

**01:55:45** I think I can make it work right.

**01:55:47** Like I believe I can handle my part, which is like I think I can stay in touch.

**01:55:52** I can consume the information that I need to form the opinions that I want to be able

**01:55:58** to effectively create good content.

**01:55:59** Like I'm very confident in that.

**01:56:02** My only wonder is like if it changes people's feelings or reactions to me and all my

**01:56:10** shows there, you know, but I am taking what I think is the best path for me.

**01:56:17** And I am hoping that people will come along on that with that in mind of like just to

**01:56:23** assume that maybe my opinions are based on the same information, not on the fact that

**01:56:27** I'm not a mastodon.

**01:56:28** You know what I mean?

**01:56:29** Yeah, I don't know.

**01:56:32** I'm just trying to express an idea here.

**01:56:35** I'm just sort of kind of mentally flipping through the people I think have

**01:56:41** interesting opinions or write interesting things or say interesting things like who

**01:56:45** do you follow in the world?

**01:56:47** And I'm trying to like plot this out on a graph of like interestingness versus

**01:56:52** connectedness.

**01:56:54** And I feel like it's something like a bell curve slightly weighed towards the less

**01:57:01** connected side of things.

**01:57:03** So people who have absolutely no connection in a real way, not the like, oh, I'm not

**01:57:09** on Twitter kind of way in the oh, I've lived in a cabin for two years and haven't

**01:57:14** read anything in the last 10 years and just have no idea what's going on.

**01:57:18** Like that tends to not be very interesting.

**01:57:21** And then as you increase connections, people can be interesting.

**01:57:26** But there's totally a diminishing returns and a rapidly diminishing turns for

**01:57:32** increased connectedness and sort of like we were saying before, the most connected

**01:57:38** people when I talk to them feel the most like talking to chat GPT like, oh, you're

**01:57:44** not a person anymore.

**01:57:45** You're just like a reflection of all the things that you're connected to.

**01:57:50** And there's no one here because if you are just connected all the time, there's no

**01:57:56** space for you to develop anything.

**01:58:00** And so it's kind of why I frowned a little bit when you told me about the vibe check

**01:58:05** thing, because in my like I know this would never really happen, but in like my

**01:58:09** fantasy world, it's like I want to hear what Mike Hurley thinks about a thing

**01:58:13** before the vibe check.

**01:58:15** That's the most interesting moment.

**01:58:17** By and large, that is the case.

**01:58:19** I'm not checking that a lot.

**01:58:21** And see, one of the things that I think I'm a little like is a sticking point for me

**01:58:26** is I think

**01:58:27** quite a lot of things in tech I could be a bit contrarian.

**01:58:31** And that's where I have a concern where people are going to forget that maybe I've

**01:58:35** always been that way, that then if I don't reference the thing that everyone's

**01:58:39** talking about, that must mean that the only reason I think differently to other

**01:58:42** people is because I'm not like up on the news.

**01:58:48** Yeah.

**01:58:49** I mean, here's the thing.

**01:58:50** You will get that kind of feedback for sure.

**01:58:55** I know because I have publicly talked about being more disconnected than the

**01:59:00** average person.

**01:59:01** I totally get that feedback where people leave these comments of like, oh, Grey's

**01:59:05** so uninformed because he doesn't know anything.

**01:59:08** That's just a natural thing that's going to happen.

**01:59:11** OK, so spoiler.

**01:59:12** That's why I have worried about this because I see these things too about you.

**01:59:16** OK, so that's the reason you're worried is that you see people like, oh,

**01:59:20** Grey doesn't know anything.

**01:59:21** Comments.

**01:59:22** It's great.

**01:59:22** Took his year away from the Internet.

**01:59:24** He doesn't know what he's talking about anymore.

**01:59:26** Like I see these things.

**01:59:27** Yeah.

**01:59:28** But like I mean, this is a this is a bigger conversation about negative

**01:59:32** feedback in general, but my take on those comments is that they're they're almost

**01:59:37** always wrong.

**01:59:38** Like the person is just.

**01:59:41** Over assuming lack of knowledge on my part because of disagreements,

**01:59:46** like that's really what's occurring.

**01:59:47** So they're running some kind of mental filter of like, oh, if they only knew more,

**01:59:52** they would agree with the opinion that I have, but they don't agree with my opinion.

**01:59:56** So that must mean they're lacking in information.

**01:59:59** And again, my thoughts on negative feedback are just if you don't agree with it,

**02:00:04** you can dismiss it relatively easily.

**02:00:07** The negative feedback that matters is the negative feedback that you agree with

**02:00:10** where you're like, oh, that person's right.

**02:00:12** But yeah, you are in a bit of a different position because

**02:00:16** you are in a place where you have to be talking about more current things on a

**02:00:24** much more frequent basis.

**02:00:27** But the reality of the situation is you're still going to be connected to things.

**02:00:34** That's why you've set up the vibe check.

**02:00:36** That's why you've set up the RSS feeds.

**02:00:39** Again, my issue is not my feeling about how I am going to be.

**02:00:43** But that's exactly like that's where I'm walking this through is like,

**02:00:46** that's the reality.

**02:00:48** If anything, like, you know, in my ideal world, I would I would reach through the

**02:00:52** computer and turn the dial down on your openness a little further.

**02:00:56** But, you know, but I totally understand why you don't want to do that.

**02:00:59** I'm not even suggesting that you should.

**02:01:01** That's just what I would do if I had the power.

**02:01:03** I expect I will.

**02:01:04** And that is my goal is to not need that.

**02:01:07** And it's why at the moment there's like 10 people in this folder.

**02:01:11** And so like it's a handful of toots a day at most.

**02:01:16** And my hope is that because I'm keeping this in my mind, the idea I want to get

**02:01:21** rid of that because I don't particularly want it.

**02:01:24** I'm seeing if I need it.

**02:01:25** And at the moment I don't.

**02:01:27** Yeah. Like I want to get through a big Apple

**02:01:30** news cycle and see how I feel after that.

**02:01:32** I think that's great.

**02:01:33** That's actually really good to have a specific moment to think about, like a thing

**02:01:37** we can reevaluate at the end of the year in the theme section.

**02:01:40** So, yeah, that's that's I'm actually really glad to hear that.

**02:01:43** But just to finish the thought is so if you're doing this and you know that you

**02:01:49** are adequately in touch and then people are leaving comments, be like,

**02:01:54** uh, I can't believe, like, said the thing on the show.

**02:01:58** He's out of touch fool.

**02:02:00** It's like, oh, but, you know, that's not true.

**02:02:02** Like, you know, you read the things about whatever the topic is.

**02:02:05** But you see, I think that's when me and you differ.

**02:02:08** And like part of why I needed to leave this part of social media is I frequently do

**02:02:15** not have that faith in myself.

**02:02:17** You ask me on any given day if I'm good at my job.

**02:02:20** I'll tell you I am.

**02:02:21** If you ask me on any given day, like what my skills are, I believe I can tell you

**02:02:26** them and I can tell you that I think I'm good at coming up with content, etc, etc.

**02:02:31** But if someone tells me you're bad at this, you're bad at this, you're bad at this,

**02:02:35** and then you ask me that question, I'm not going to give you the same answers.

**02:02:39** Right.

**02:02:42** But this is part of that.

**02:02:43** I have to be able to start from this place of like, I believe I'm good at what I do

**02:02:48** straight up, right, that I don't have to rely on other people's opinions to be able

**02:02:55** to form my own. The only way I can do this is I have to be able to start there.

**02:02:59** And I feel like now in twenty twenty three, I'm able to start there.

**02:03:04** But I am still susceptible to the doubt piece, which is the other part of why I can

**02:03:08** do it. Right. So like I believe I can leave now because I'm good enough at what I do.

**02:03:13** I also want to leave now so I don't have to be ground down.

**02:03:18** I guess I guess what I'm just trying to walk through here is

**02:03:22** the acknowledgment that comments about you being out of touch are inevitable.

**02:03:29** And that's fine.

**02:03:30** In some ways, I look at that as a price for increased interestingness.

**02:03:36** That's why I was thinking about like this graph before.

**02:03:39** There's some there's some sweet spot about like turning down the dial and turning up

**02:03:44** the dial for like where where do you want to be if you do this kind of work?

**02:03:50** But everything, everything in life is a trade off.

**02:03:53** And this is one of those moments.

**02:03:55** So like this is a trade off for a net positive increase in a bunch of things.

**02:04:02** It's a net positive increase in making yourself less chat GPT like when you talk

**02:04:08** about conversations, that's like a side effect of decreasing connectedness.

**02:04:11** It's a net gain in decrease in random derailments.

**02:04:16** But you don't get net gains without some kind of negative.

**02:04:21** And I just feel like this negative is relatively minor because it is only a

**02:04:27** negative. I don't want to say in perception,

**02:04:30** but I guess it's a negative from your perception that you just know that you

**02:04:35** have a harder time with those kinds of comments.

**02:04:37** So that's why I was just trying to say like, oh, but it's not true.

**02:04:40** And so you can kind of dismiss those sorts of comments if you know, like, oh, no,

**02:04:44** but I did read up on that topic.

**02:04:46** Like I I know more than this person thought I did.

**02:04:48** They're just assuming that I know nothing.

**02:04:50** That's sort of trying to express my thoughts on this.

**02:04:54** But I'm very pro you doing this move.

**02:04:58** I just feel like you can't do anything on the Internet when you are at any size of

**02:05:03** audience without having some people be really mad about it.

**02:05:07** Of course, this is going to inevitably be negative feedback.

**02:05:11** Some of it, it hurts because it's accurate and it's like, ah,

**02:05:15** they got me in my secret heart like they knew or like, yeah, that was that was real

**02:05:19** bad. But some of it is just like totally

**02:05:22** baseless and you you have to learn to mentally divide those two things as two

**02:05:28** fundamentally different kinds of things, the negative feedback that is baseless or

**02:05:34** that you don't agree with and the negative feedback that you do agree with.

**02:05:38** And they're just like they're almost like two unrelated categories and you have to

**02:05:42** kind of train yourself to think about them in that way.

**02:05:45** Yeah. And I think I have gotten better at this.

**02:05:48** Oh, for sure. For sure.

**02:05:51** You've known me for a long time and you've seen a lot of change in me.

**02:05:55** But it's like that I still like I believe I am able to separate those things.

**02:06:01** But I haven't gotten to the point where they still don't make me annoyed though.

**02:06:05** Yeah. And that may never go away because that can just be a human reflex for

**02:06:11** like it's this kind of thing again.

**02:06:13** And the annoyance can come from the fact of knowing, well, this will just be

**02:06:17** inevitable forever.

**02:06:19** Now that you have spoken about leaving Twitter, it's like, oh, inevitably forever.

**02:06:24** There's going to be the mics out of touch comments.

**02:06:26** And that's just that's just a thing.

**02:06:28** That's just like a negative cost for all of the positive upside.

**02:06:32** But again, if it couldn't be more clear,

**02:06:34** number one, I am the best person to judge this.

**02:06:37** And I think it's a great decision.

**02:06:38** Number two, I think it's a great decision.

**02:06:40** Like, I'm glad to hear that you've done this.

**02:06:42** I hadn't really thought about the situation kind of giving you cover.

**02:06:46** But you're right. Like, it's perfect.

**02:06:48** Like, if you're going to do this.

**02:06:51** This is the lowest friction way to step away from Twitter.

**02:06:57** Like, I'm happy that you've taken advantage of the, shall we say,

**02:07:01** unique moment in Twitter's history and like this can be some real upside for you.

**02:07:07** And I'm also just really glad to hear that you

**02:07:10** you know, you haven't played the migration game that everybody plays.

**02:07:14** Like, oh, now we're all going to go over to this thing.

**02:07:16** That game never ends, which is why it's

**02:07:19** interesting to hear from you even just a little bit like, oh, Mastodon already

**02:07:23** intrinsically has the things that we can just set our watches and wait until the

**02:07:27** time when everybody decides that Mastodon is terrible and we're all going to go

**02:07:31** over to some other place.

**02:07:32** So I'm like, I'm glad to hear that you're not having this in your life in any way.

**02:07:38** And yeah, RSS, it's great.

**02:07:41** It's back again.

**02:07:43** Who would have ever thought like 2023 is the year of RSS, but it totally is.
