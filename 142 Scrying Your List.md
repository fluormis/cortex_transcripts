# Cortex - 142: Scrying Your List
**00:00:00** Hi, Mike. Oh, hello. We're here. It's like a regular episode of Cortex. Ah, yes. Just a normal non-special episode. Normal Tex.

**00:00:10** We just ended up having two

**00:00:12** very

**00:00:13** Particular episodes back to back. Yeah, this is one of those things where when you make stuff

**00:00:18** Sometimes you have this little moment where it's like oh it just so happens to work out that we ended up with two special episodes

**00:00:24** In a row, but then what always happens is if you do two of something in a row people are like, oh my god

**00:00:30** Is this what it's going to be like forever? It's like no, no, it's no no, it's okay guys

**00:00:33** Like sometimes this just happens we've been talking

**00:00:37** Vaguely for like a year now maybe about trying to do

**00:00:42** More what we're thinking of as like single topic episodes. We're like trying to create these episodes

**00:00:48** that are maybe

**00:00:50** Easier jumping on points for the show. Yeah, because we kind of feel like we had them already naturally like state of the apps and yearly

**00:00:57** themes became these

**00:00:59** Singular things which aren't part of the month by month timeline of the show where we've kind of run

**00:01:06** Through a whole year talking this day like on this episode we're gonna do follow-up from previous episodes

**00:01:11** But those episodes don't have any of that and we notice that people seem to really like them

**00:01:15** So we were trying to find ways to add more

**00:01:18** Special things throughout the year the goal really is to add more episodes as opposed to

**00:01:25** Turning more of our like regular episodes into these specials. Yeah, it's one of these things is like thinking about the show

**00:01:31** one of the things that's been

**00:01:33** Interesting to see that we talked about before it's just like the youtube channel is doing really well

**00:01:38** And I feel like the youtube channel has become a way to onboard people to the whole rest of the show. Yeah

**00:01:43** and

**00:01:44** You know me mike. I love a good spreadsheet. I love looking at some data

**00:01:48** and I was just really aware of like oh a lot of our shows that tend to be

**00:01:53** Dominated by a single topic seem like they're significantly better for new people

**00:01:59** And so this was also realizing like we've been kind of doing a lot of

**00:02:04** Half special episodes without even realizing it so like a lot of our like book reviews, right?

**00:02:09** Or like talking about a documentary that kind of stuff was like basically half a special

**00:02:15** And as with many things it seems so obvious in retrospect, but you discover

**00:02:20** Oh, right when there's a clear topic

**00:02:23** It's just a much easier place for people to start with a podcast that they're not familiar with

**00:02:29** And I feel like this is always the fundamental problem for podcasts is discovery and so many podcasts you have the issue of

**00:02:37** Oh god, there's like hundreds of episodes. Do I need to start at the beginning? Where do I go?

**00:02:42** Any individual episode is dominated by everything else that came before right at the start

**00:02:48** And so like just jumping in at a random point is hard

**00:02:51** So we thought like okay

**00:02:52** Let's just follow the data here and see if we can do some more of these like individual episodes that are clearly focused on a thing

**00:03:00** As a way to get people on board nice and easy with the show

**00:03:05** And as I already said, and I really want to underscore this these are extra

**00:03:09** We're not going to make the show like lose all of its through line

**00:03:12** Right like because that's important to me too because I also think that this might be a reason somebody comes to the show

**00:03:18** But then they end up sticking around for our audio issues

**00:03:22** You know what I mean?

**00:03:23** Like because that just becomes a thing and I would just say to you now talking about putting the episode in time

**00:03:27** I wasn't listening to you for about 25 seconds there because I just got my invite to go to upper park for wwdc

**00:03:34** Hey

**00:03:36** Congratulations. Oh my god. That's super exciting

**00:03:39** Wow, we create the prayer circle amongst all cortexans

**00:03:43** We all join hands that mike actually f***ing makes it this time and doesn't sit in a hotel room for two weeks

**00:03:51** Oh, dude, i'm so excited for you. Oh, that's really great. It says you're invited

**00:03:57** I

**00:03:58** Like i'm i'm not gonna lie

**00:04:00** Like when we were talking before and the invite hadn't come through like I wasn't gonna say anything

**00:04:05** But but I had a big cloud of oh no fill the room

**00:04:10** So, oh i'm so pumped. Oh, that's great. That is like that is the best news all week

**00:04:15** I am so happy you got that invitation. So wow i'm gonna do it. I'm doing it. Nothing's gonna stop me now

**00:04:22** I'm gonna be there. So what are your plans? What's what's gonna happen? What can you share that you're gonna be doing?

**00:04:26** Well, all I know right now is it says I will be in person to watch the keynote address at apple park

**00:04:32** Like that's that's all I have

**00:04:34** That will be if I actually can do it the realization of 15 years of work

**00:04:40** Like this is my bucket list

**00:04:42** Which is why it was so soul crushing last year

**00:04:46** It's like this is for me

**00:04:48** In that part of my work of like apple focus podcasting the one

**00:04:55** Thing left. Yeah, it's the one goal the one dream left to achieve

**00:05:00** Is get to it pretty much every single one of my colleagues at this point has done it and I nearly had it and I

**00:05:07** Couldn't do it last year because in case you're new to the show because you just found stay at the hardware

**00:05:13** Last year I was invited to wwdc

**00:05:17** I made it out and I tested positive coronavirus the day before so I couldn't go

**00:05:23** And this time i'm locking myself down

**00:05:27** No one's coming near me and i'm gonna go and i'm gonna be there and i'm so excited

**00:05:33** I want to get some photos of

**00:05:35** Mike bubble wrap boy on the airplane

**00:05:39** Just my whole head covered in 95 months

**00:05:43** This is the time to be a lunatic and buy all of the eight seats around your seat

**00:05:48** Like you buy a middle seat right and buy like all of the immediate seats around you

**00:05:51** I mean like nobody's here, right when people move over and they go. Oh, we're a family. We wanted to sit together

**00:05:57** There's a free row. How delightful you say no, I purchased those seats

**00:06:02** Get out of here

**00:06:04** Oh

**00:06:06** Oh man, i'm so relieved. It's so happy

**00:06:09** Uh, that's fantastic. Bye. I've been so nervous about it, right? Because it's just like I just want to do it

**00:06:15** You know like it felt like it was gonna happen today

**00:06:18** And it has happened today and I feel like a weight has been lifted

**00:06:23** Off my shoulders. I just want to get there. I'm gonna go to apple park

**00:06:27** I'm gonna see the presentation all i'm gonna be doing is sitting in a chair and watching a screen

**00:06:32** But I will be doing it inside the venue. That's all I want to do to like

**00:06:37** I am a media professional

**00:06:40** Yeah going to the thing like I will be in the media area with the other media professionals

**00:06:47** I have worked

**00:06:48** So hard for so long to achieve this

**00:06:52** thing to be recognized as someone

**00:06:56** Who should be there?

**00:06:58** And my hope gray like that. I will my first

**00:07:02** keynote is going to be one of the defining keynotes, right like

**00:07:07** Introduction of a brand new platform and if that's the case, right and I get that

**00:07:13** I kind of feel like you know what missing out in last year's worth it because I will be able to say like my first one

**00:07:19** Was this one? Oh man. Yeah

**00:07:22** I'm trying to think of a way to phrase something right which is like

**00:07:26** Apple doesn't owe anything to anyone, right? Like they they can do whatever they want. They can invite whoever they want for whatever

**00:07:34** wacky and whimsical arbitrary reasons fills their little apple heart with joy, whatever like they can do what they want

**00:07:41** but at the same time I can think of

**00:07:45** I can think of no one else in the tech industry who

**00:07:49** Deserves to be there more who hasn't been there yet, right? It's like it's the intersection of these three things

**00:07:57** So our next episode we're going to be recording after the bwbc

**00:08:01** Oh great, right, of course. Yes

**00:08:03** So not only will it be our wbtc episode remember that the last half of last year's which is really sad

**00:08:09** Yes, yeah, it should be really happy

**00:08:12** I really have the feeling that I just keep like blocking this story out of my brain because it's too sad to think about

**00:08:18** A couple of months ago. I went back and listened because like there were three shows that I did, right?

**00:08:24** So I did like upgrade connected and cortex and I just went back and listened to like the intro of them all

**00:08:31** Because I just wanted to like remind myself

**00:08:35** Of that moment and it was just like listening back to it was like wow like that just feels like a completely different time

**00:08:41** Like a different person in a way. It was just such a strange set of circumstances

**00:08:47** where I had to

**00:08:49** I've never really had something like this happen to me before where

**00:08:53** Especially with upgrade because that was on keynote day, right?

**00:08:57** Where I just had to dig deep

**00:09:00** And pull it together and get the work done

**00:09:03** You have a job to do and you just gotta do that job. You are very sad, but you've got to make it happen

**00:09:09** Yeah, and yeah

**00:09:10** It was I just was like trying to recall like how did I sound like and I actually think I did a good job

**00:09:16** Like listening back to it and just getting on with it

**00:09:22** This year will be very different I think yeah

**00:09:25** Yeah

**00:09:26** We're in the timeline now

**00:09:28** I was really hoping this was going to happen today that it would come during our recording

**00:09:33** Like I was I was really hoping this was a good moment

**00:09:36** And then I hope we'll follow it up in a few weeks with another good moment

**00:12:11** Our thanks to memberful for their support of this show and relay fm

**00:12:15** I have some follow-up for you. Oh, okay. So I use the backpack which backpack

**00:12:19** So in the last episode I told you about my new belroy venture ready backpack. Mm-hmm

**00:12:25** So i've used it now as my traveling bag to replace the peak design bag

**00:12:31** What'd you think of it super in this bag is fantastic. I'm really happy with it. It is way better for me

**00:12:39** For what I want out of a bag like this I could get more in it

**00:12:43** It was more logical for me where like all of the pockets are inside

**00:12:47** So like it's not like where's this where's that like it was just much simpler

**00:12:52** What I will say is, you know works for me

**00:12:54** It wouldn't work for you with the way you were describing it as like you didn't want just a big open space

**00:12:59** But 100 is that but I like that because a lot of the stuff i'm putting in the bag

**00:13:04** Goes in its own little pouch or whatever

**00:13:06** It's just like a bunch of blocks and I just grab the ones that I need right the case as my airpods max in

**00:13:12** I have the belroy tech pouch that has my cables in I have my nintendo switch case that has my nintendo switch in right like

**00:13:17** I don't need that in pockets because it's all very

**00:13:20** Protected and it just makes sense and then I can also just like I have a sweatshirt and just throw it in there

**00:13:25** I was never able to get that to work with the peak design

**00:13:29** I could never have put a sweatshirt in that bag with the way that I packed it like it was just not going to happen

**00:13:34** But this one was much more simple like the water bottle pocket was easy

**00:13:38** I hate the side pockets on the peak design trying to get a water bottle in there is almost impossible for me

**00:13:43** But this just was easier

**00:13:45** I really liked the little secret pocket to put my passport and my keys in and it has the little thing I click my keys to

**00:13:51** These are all simple things. Yeah, but it's what makes the difference in backpacks

**00:13:55** So it's like it's the backpacks are entirely the sum of small details. Yeah, so yeah

**00:13:59** Yeah

**00:14:00** And cortex and adam wrote in to cortexfeedback.com

**00:14:03** To let us know about a line of belroy bags that I didn't even know existed called the transit

**00:14:09** Workpack line they do a 20 28 and 38 liter of these

**00:14:14** Hmm, this is very similar to the bag that I have

**00:14:18** But is more focused on the daily commute rather than the like the bag I got is more like uh, you're going out into the world

**00:14:26** But that was kind of perfect for me for general travel like as a as a travel bag, but this is a

**00:14:33** Commuter's backpack that you can put overnight clothes in hmm

**00:14:37** They even have compression straps in the backpack, which is like very smart

**00:14:41** I think because I've never seen that in a backpack before for if you're putting clothes in the bag

**00:14:45** Oh, okay. Right, right. I see yeah

**00:14:48** And also there's I think there's a little bit more structured organization in this bag than the one that I have

**00:14:53** I don't know why I didn't think to look for a belroy backpack before now like I have so many products

**00:15:00** Including my daily commuter bag. I don't know why it never struck me to look at them to replace my travel bag

**00:15:08** So I will thank instagram ads for making this possible

**00:15:11** It seems like you have gotten quite a lot of value in your life out of instagram ads

**00:15:16** This is a very normal thing. Like if you use instagram enough their advertising system

**00:15:22** Really just gets to know you

**00:15:24** I would say like instagram ads are the most effective and my favorite way to receive advertising

**00:15:31** Because I found so many things on there that are genuinely useful and helpful to me

**00:15:35** Like i'm happy with advertising if it feels like a two-way street, right? You're gonna show me the ads anyway

**00:15:42** I at least want them to work for me

**00:15:44** Yeah, it is always weird when people complain about targeting advertising like I I partly understand it

**00:15:50** But I also have the feeling of like but I want the ads to be relevant to me

**00:15:54** Like if I have to see them anyway

**00:15:57** I would way prefer that the ads have something to do with me than are just about

**00:16:02** Random products. I don't know anyone who

**00:16:06** Thanks an advertising platform as much as I hear you. Thank instagram ads for bringing things into your life

**00:16:12** It just it works, man. It works

**00:16:14** Like this is one of you know when like apple did the app tracking thing. Yeah when it said like hey, do you want to?

**00:16:21** You know like the person I was like, no, I I want the ads to remain personalized for instagram

**00:16:26** Most of the time I say don't track me because it's like you're opening some app for the first time

**00:16:30** It's like why would I I have no relationship with you app?

**00:16:33** Like why am I gonna let you track me?

**00:16:35** But with instagram it's like no

**00:16:37** I want the tracking to continue because i'm getting value out of this if they're still going to show me the ads anyway

**00:16:43** If they become less relevant to me

**00:16:45** Then it's an annoyance

**00:16:47** Yeah, very happy with the bellroy backpack the venture ready backpack. So i'm gonna mark this up again of like

**00:16:54** For me if you buy, you know, if you want something and it's on bellroy

**00:16:58** This is how I feel like i'm just gonna get it because I know i'm gonna like it because every single bellroy product i've owned

**00:17:04** I have really enjoyed and used and i'm very happy with it. So

**00:17:08** Yeah, yeah, they're good. I also like their little logo. Their logo is very pleasing to me. It's nice

**00:17:12** Yeah, I know this this transit work pack is intriguing to me

**00:17:16** I I like the this it's calling it like clamshell thing where the whole thing opens if you lay it flat

**00:17:21** I find that very drawsome as a product

**00:17:24** This design is the same as on my one and what I really liked about it

**00:17:27** It might be a little complicated here because they have a pocket on the front, but I could just open half

**00:17:33** And just like roll half of the bag down

**00:17:35** It was like an easy way to get in and out

**00:17:37** But I guess if you put things in that front pocket, you might not be able to to fold it in half the same

**00:17:42** Yeah

**00:17:43** I feel like i'm I might be drawn to this one

**00:17:46** since again

**00:17:47** Backpacks infinite market like we discussed last time I neglected to mention i'll just mention it here because it is worth it like

**00:17:53** The other backpack that I do have is the tombin daylight backpack

**00:17:59** And i'll say right away. I do not love this backpack

**00:18:03** But this is one of these cases where i'm trying to optimize for light

**00:18:09** And this is like the perfect backpack for that if like my primary concern is just it being light like this backpack works

**00:18:17** This is interesting. This looks to me like I think it's in the way they're marketing it as like

**00:18:22** The backpack you have in your suitcase for when you go to the place, which is exactly how I have used it

**00:18:27** Yes, so that's interesting this rolls up to nothing like when it when it is empty. It takes up zero space in a suitcase

**00:18:35** And it's funny since that show I kind of remembered like oh, right

**00:18:39** I can go out

**00:18:41** With my laptop and so i've actually taken this a couple of times out into the city to just like work in some random spots

**00:18:46** Which I haven't done since before covid

**00:18:49** But did it take state of the harbor to remind you of this? Yes, it did. Yeah, I

**00:18:53** I honestly think this is one of these things where I just gotten into a habit

**00:18:59** From the past several years of like oh, you just can't go anywhere

**00:19:03** And somehow there's like lodged it in my brain and like

**00:19:07** Oh, no, I like I totally can I can just throw my laptop into my backpack and go somewhere sometimes

**00:19:14** And so it's like oh it's been a lovely afternoon at the british museum just like working on a script in their little cafe

**00:19:20** It's like this is delightful, right?

**00:19:22** This is the advantage of living in a major city and just being able to like go somewhere and for that purpose

**00:19:27** This is like the perfect backpack. I I only want it to be light

**00:19:31** That is my primary concern because i'm pretty much just putting a laptop in there and maybe like a charger and a bottle of water

**00:19:38** And that's it. That's all I want for it

**00:19:40** Congratulations on your promotion. Do we have a job title for you?

**00:19:44** Uh, I don't know. Do we have a job title for me? I mean we could come up with one. Maybe you could be like

**00:19:50** Chief logistics officer i'll take clo that works for me. Is that a c-level office?

**00:19:56** I don't know how c-level offices work. It seems like they just pick a word, right?

**00:20:00** Everybody's like yes

**00:20:01** The whatever and companies are just making up whatever they want for the c-level stuff

**00:20:05** Yeah, you could just make whatever you want. It can be whatever you want it to be. Yeah, so yeah

**00:20:08** I'll take clo i'll take chief logistics officer. That's that works for me

**00:20:12** Actually, i'm just having a funny moment here. I think this is

**00:20:16** The first promotion I have ever gotten in my whole life, which i'm just realizing

**00:20:22** I'm just trying to think of all of my jobs

**00:20:24** I either

**00:20:26** Never got promoted

**00:20:27** And I got one demotion

**00:20:30** Which was my very first job where I worked as a page at a library as a kid

**00:20:35** I started I think because of some favors my dad pulled in the very prestigious

**00:20:40** Reference department of the library working as a page and helping people look up stuff and then like an idiot

**00:20:47** I needlessly antagonized my boss and got demoted to the children's library

**00:20:54** Wow, what were you doing at the children's library?

**00:20:57** I was mostly just hiding and trying like to avoid the shame of it which as a

**00:21:03** Tall teenager was really hard because in the children's library all the bookshelves were really short

**00:21:09** So it was like there was nowhere to hide and the children's library was terrible

**00:21:13** I was mainly just like restocking books that little kids were returning that kind of stuff

**00:21:17** But yeah, so i'm just i'm just thinking yeah all of my other jobs like when I worked as a teacher

**00:21:22** I was aggressively avoiding promotions. I was offered it a couple times and like, please no

**00:21:28** I would just rather stay a frontline teacher. So yeah, this is my very first promotion ever. Thanks, Mike chief logistics officer at cortex brand

**00:21:36** I don't even remember how this started but you made a spreadsheet. Yeah

**00:21:41** The this is one of these funny things. I don't really know what this is like from your perspective. I kind of feel like I have been

**00:21:48** bullying you for the past

**00:21:51** month and a half in some ways

**00:21:53** slash also being a real

**00:21:56** Overly explaining nerd is this is like my perception of it

**00:22:00** But yeah, it's a thing that i've just had in the back of my mind for a long time that

**00:22:05** as soon as we had a second

**00:22:08** Project that was of similar or larger size than the theme system journal

**00:22:14** I thought oh at this point

**00:22:16** it makes sense because there's enough things and enough data to

**00:22:21** Start building a spreadsheet to try to assist the business whereas before with just the theme system

**00:22:27** It always felt to me like there wasn't really enough there to work with so from my perspective what happened is

**00:22:33** The sidekick notepad was a surprise success

**00:22:37** Which had the good problem to have we were running out of stock way too fast

**00:22:43** This is how it started

**00:22:45** Basically, I built a little spreadsheet to try to give you some estimates about what was happening with the stock because I just

**00:22:53** I know from experience that when you're looking at data like daily sales numbers, it's very

**00:22:59** hard to accurately predict

**00:23:02** Where this ends up over a long period of time that what seemed like small variations in daily sales

**00:23:08** Over the space of two months can make a huge difference in like when are you actually going to run out or not?

**00:23:13** So that's what it was. I made this spreadsheet as

**00:23:17** Starting as a piece of evidence to show you

**00:23:20** To try to talk to you about like hey, we've got to change the way we do logistics around here

**00:23:25** So that's my perspective on how it got started and then I feel like I was basically

**00:23:31** Bullying you and slowly improving this over time is how it feels like to me

**00:23:35** But how does it feel like to you what like what happened from your perspective here?

**00:23:38** So it I mean it kind of started with a little spreadsheet and a bunch of phone calls where you were quite manic

**00:23:46** In explaining to me what you were doing. Is that fair? I don't know. Yes, you were very excited

**00:23:51** But I loved the excitement and I loved the excitement and it's turned out to be I think over like a six-week period or so

**00:23:59** You've created like three spreadsheets

**00:24:02** They just keep that's how it feels to me like it looks like this and now it's all gone and it looks like this

**00:24:08** And now we have the restock-o-tron is the thing that you've built now, which is like a dashboard showing all of the stuff

**00:24:15** So we now have this huge spreadsheet

**00:24:17** Where I input the daily sales figures for all of our products and it's doing some very I assume intense

**00:24:25** mathematics to work out

**00:24:27** What is our expected daily sales rate like kind of flattened out right rather than just all the peaks and stuff?

**00:24:34** What are the dates that we expect a product's going to be in stock until

**00:24:37** How many months of stock do we think we have like it's doing a bunch of smart stuff to predict things?

**00:24:42** but what I want to explain from my side is

**00:24:45** When you make a change to the spreadsheet you like to explain it to me

**00:24:48** right, and so you tell me what's going on and I get these slack messages from you that have the vibe to me of

**00:24:58** You were at the train station

**00:25:00** There are two trains coming towards each other one is at 60 miles an hour and one is at 40 miles an hour

**00:25:06** Which one will find its way to Albuquerque quickest?

**00:25:09** That is how every single message you have sent me about the spreadsheet reads to me. I cannot understand

**00:25:15** The I know all of the words. Oh, no, but when you put them together, I don't understand

**00:25:23** any of it

**00:25:28** What I understand oh god, I feel shame

**00:25:31** Right. So like the output is fantastic and like

**00:25:36** Like just the spreadsheet itself is incredible. But as you were trying to explain things to me

**00:25:42** I don't understand

**00:25:45** What it means?

**00:25:47** I just don't it doesn't make any sense to me at all

**00:25:51** But I love that you love it

**00:25:54** Oh

**00:25:55** Oh my uh

**00:25:57** Oh

**00:26:01** Okay, um, well that's interesting to take on board because uh

**00:26:07** Yeah, i've been basically kind of treating this as like

**00:26:11** Extremely lightweight app developments and giving my like change logs, right of like oh, here's what's changed on the spreadsheet

**00:26:19** Here's what's changed on the spreadsheet. Okay. So here's what I say when you give me those it's good

**00:26:24** But I want can I read an example? Okay about 10 days ago you completely redid the spreadsheet and

**00:26:31** Exploded our slack with explaining things for me, right?

**00:26:35** I woke up with some good ideas. It was fun

**00:26:37** Look unique. I I need you to understand

**00:26:40** I am over the moon that you have made this and that you want to be like this engaged with such specific things like this

**00:26:47** Right, like i'm i'm super excited about that

**00:26:50** Uh-huh

**00:26:51** Okay, pendator is still new which the error range column is telling you by being a shorthand for how

**00:26:58** Unconfident it is in all of the numbers in that row

**00:27:01** Edited to add I should probably reverse that to be more human readable

**00:27:06** Like I did i'm reading these things and i'm like

**00:27:11** And I get this feeling of like should I understand what that means

**00:27:16** I don't I don't know

**00:27:18** Should understand what it means

**00:27:21** You don't need to know but I will just point out that the new predictor tran starts out on column bn

**00:27:26** So column c through bm are all hidden calculations

**00:27:29** I'm like, ah, yes

**00:27:32** You must hide the calculations

**00:27:36** See like okay i'm trying to like articulate like what is it that i've been trying to express here?

**00:27:41** And I think what it is is a little bit of

**00:27:44** My concern level is very high

**00:27:47** That you won't take the spreadsheet seriously

**00:27:51** And in some ways the spreadsheet is the manifestation of my panic over not running out of stock

**00:27:58** Okay, like I think as a company there's a couple of things that are just major problems that people

**00:28:04** often don't consider and like we've talked about this on the show before that like

**00:28:08** Running out of stock is a thing that sounds like it's great because you've sold all your things

**00:28:13** But it's a real business problem to like not have stock in

**00:28:18** And since i've taken over as like chief logistics officer here

**00:28:23** Putting things together in terms of numbers to me has been like oh my god

**00:28:28** Like being out of stock for a month is a disaster like because we have actual numbers of what that means

**00:28:34** And then i'm trying to predict like

**00:28:37** Ooh, I think it is non-obvious that we need to have much more stock on hand than we previously thought

**00:28:45** And so my feeling is like i'm trying to put together a document of evidence that shows this and like makes recommendations about how much stock

**00:28:52** We should be buying when

**00:28:54** But i'm constantly afraid that when I change something you're going to be like, hey wait that estimate changed by 50 percent

**00:29:02** Like what's even happening over here in this like clown logistics department if like the estimates are going up and down

**00:29:08** These guys in the logistics apartment they're going well over here

**00:29:11** Yeah, exactly like like down at the coffee machine slacking you off to the other employees

**00:29:17** Yeah, but like you're you're you're going to look at it and you end like so I think the thing with that

**00:29:22** Like that message about the error rate. I know exactly what I was thinking where I was like

**00:29:25** I was trying to express like oh, hey

**00:29:28** This this is trying to show you what the anticipated error rate in these calculations is so like the real value is this value

**00:29:35** Plus or minus 45 percent and like that's just something that we need to keep in mind

**00:29:40** So I think that's what it is. Like I feel the need to explain every time i've changed something

**00:29:46** Because I don't want you to feel

**00:29:49** Like i'm just making

**00:29:51** Random changes over here and it's like oh these numbers keep going like up and down and like today

**00:29:56** He says I need to order x mini units and then tomorrow

**00:29:59** He says I need to order twice x units that is like why like what change between yesterday and today?

**00:30:05** And then that's where i'm coming in going like well

**00:30:07** Let me tell you what changed between yesterday and today like i'm using a different method

**00:30:11** To try to estimate what the resubscribe rate is for theme system journals like that kind of thing

**00:30:16** Here's the thing that you need to know, right? I feel like we're having this is like business therapy at the moment

**00:30:22** Yeah

**00:30:25** I trust you

**00:30:27** You need to know like this thing that you're making I trust you if you tell me it's this and this is the day

**00:30:32** I will just trust you because okay

**00:30:34** What I know is I don't understand how to do this

**00:30:37** Like I have been doing this stuff on gut. Yeah. Yeah, right and we've done

**00:30:43** Okay. Yeah, but i'm doing it on gut and that's not

**00:30:47** A sustainable long-term thing and I know that at some point we had to get smart about this

**00:30:52** I didn't know that this would be something you would be so engaged in and now i'm super happy that one of us is doing this

**00:30:59** Yeah, and I guarantee you the best person for the job is the guy who's currently doing it because I just I don't understand

**00:31:08** Like you tell me these terms and like and I I get what they mean

**00:31:11** But I don't know how you get there. So like one of the things you're talking about a lot is like a confidence

**00:31:17** Rate of like the amount of data that you're putting into the system

**00:31:21** Is allowing you to be able to predict things confidently and each product has a confidence rating in the restockatron

**00:31:29** About how confident you are in the dates that you're giving right of like when it needs to be restocked

**00:31:35** I don't understand how you are able to calculate that like I know what goes in and I know what comes out

**00:31:43** But like this is when everything in the middle I don't get it

**00:31:46** I've never been able to understand things like this like the the calculations required and so like

**00:31:52** You can please feel free to continue giving me this information

**00:31:56** But like there are things of it that are very helpful

**00:31:58** Like when we had a conversation today about subscriber numbers and how they're being calculated and like that

**00:32:04** I understand but like when you're like, so this is how I did this

**00:32:08** And if you want to tell me because I know that like sometimes you just want to

**00:32:14** Like an i'm like this like people just want to say things aloud, right? Because it like just helps with

**00:32:19** Going through a thing did you know did I do this right?

**00:32:21** How does this feel when I explain it to someone and maybe you're able to work through some problems if i'm asking you questions

**00:32:28** But like I just need you to know I don't understand it. Okay

**00:32:33** It's also funny that you mentioned about like what you put in and like what comes out

**00:32:38** So for any aspiring spreadsheet makers out there like this is one of my

**00:32:43** Basic pieces of advice is the thing i've done on the spreadsheet for mike

**00:32:47** Especially if you're working in a team, but even on on your own

**00:32:50** You need to have two colors on your spreadsheet

**00:32:53** Make the background of some cells green and that's where information comes in and then some cells are blue and that's where information

**00:33:02** Comes out and I think like I don't know if this is exactly your experience

**00:33:05** But I feel like that's one way to try to make a spreadsheet clear of like what's happening

**00:33:10** Because yeah, ultimately it's just a machine where you want to put some numbers in and then you should get some meaningful

**00:33:17** actionable information out and

**00:33:21** Everything else in the middle doesn't matter especially if

**00:33:24** Yeah, because because again like we're in this position of i'm performing a job where i'm trying to give you a tool

**00:33:30** Because you're ultimately the person who is working way more closely with the manufacturers than I ever will

**00:33:38** And so you're always going to be the person

**00:33:41** Making the final call about orders and how much are you willing to pay and like when is it going to come or?

**00:33:47** If we have it shipped this way or that way like what will happen eventually these are all data points, right?

**00:33:52** After a certain period of time we'll know exactly how long it takes to reproduce every product

**00:33:57** So then it can just maybe put into the system

**00:33:59** You know what I mean like oh, well, yeah

**00:34:00** I mean, yes

**00:34:01** That's one of the things that I want to have as an upgrade at some point in the future and I was trying not to

**00:34:04** Bug you earlier today

**00:34:05** But I was like mike I need historical data about how long is it between when you send the first email and when like the thing?

**00:34:11** Arrives at the warehouse like I just want to start having historical data about that

**00:34:16** But yeah

**00:34:17** so there is this thing with all spreadsheets of input output and then calculations in between and I think

**00:34:23** For lots of people when they make spreadsheets, it's not visually clear

**00:34:27** Like you need to separate out these parts and then all of the quote normal cells a user can just completely ignore

**00:34:35** Like all of the crazy stuff that's happening in the middle

**00:34:38** But yeah, I think you're partly right even that little thing that you just read there

**00:34:43** You can see that I edited to add that I was like, oh, wait a minute

**00:34:47** This number that i'm giving you it's more human readable if it's the opposite direction

**00:34:52** I think it's just funny to me now to hear you say like

**00:34:55** Gray either way. I don't know what the hell

**00:35:01** But I please I don't I want to create good working environment

**00:35:06** Please continue sharing all of the information. There is some stuff in there that is genuinely helpful to me

**00:35:13** But some of it it's going over my head

**00:35:15** But I am and I have where like I need feel like I need to understand I am asking for more clarification

**00:35:22** This is just not my skill set like it just isn't I don't understand how to make a spreadsheet like the one that you've made

**00:35:29** Like I know how to make very simple spreadsheets

**00:35:32** Like I just made one a couple of days ago to help me calculate

**00:35:37** The overall cost of a thing because you wanted that and so I figured well i've been doing it all manually

**00:35:41** So i'm actually just made a number spreadsheet that would just do a bunch of the calculations for me

**00:35:46** But that's kind of where my experience starts and ends, you know, I know I have to take this cell multiply it by that cell

**00:35:53** But I know that there's a bunch of things going on in this spreadsheet that I just don't know

**00:35:59** How anyone could understand you showed me this book that you bought? Oh, no

**00:36:03** which is just like

**00:36:05** Maybe the worst book for me ever written, but you seem very excited about it

**00:36:10** All right, the book I was very excited. It was a book on statistics, right or something like logistic statistics

**00:36:16** I'm yeah, well, so

**00:36:19** This is kind of embarrassing. What's the actual book title?

**00:36:23** Because my wife had a completely different reaction to like so both you and my wife were like

**00:36:28** What the hell is this book?

**00:36:30** You just purchased

**00:36:32** Okay, so the exact title of the book is called

**00:36:36** Understanding variation the key to managing chaos

**00:36:40** And it has a little picture of like a nebula on the front, you know in like a spacey kind of image

**00:36:47** and

**00:36:48** My wife took one look at this

**00:36:50** and she goes

**00:36:52** What the hell is this new age crap that you just bought?

**00:36:55** It does look like that the fun on the front cover is very new agey

**00:37:00** Yeah

**00:37:00** So if you didn't know anything about it

**00:37:02** It was a completely acceptable judgment to make of like what happened to my husband that he bought this dumb

**00:37:09** Book right like she's she's used to weird books getting shipped to the house all the time because of my job

**00:37:15** but

**00:37:15** Even among someone who buys outlier books this one caught her attention as extremely worrying

**00:37:21** For I can't believe this arrived when I saw this i'm like what has happened to my co-founder? Why has he bought this book?

**00:37:28** Is it I don't I don't understand even when you explained what it did or what it was for and you sent me some screenshots to some pages?

**00:37:36** And I don't know what it means

**00:37:38** I don't know what it even means. How would you describe what you think this book is?

**00:37:43** Like

**00:37:45** The lord of the rings for statistics what an interesting description there

**00:37:51** Maybe that's also saying about how I feel about lord of the rings

**00:37:55** I feel like you've disparaged two things at once very close to my heart with lord of the ring

**00:38:00** Every count has an area of opportunity here

**00:38:04** The area of opportunity is the number of closings each month if the area of opportunity remains constant over time

**00:38:10** Then one may directly compare the counts

**00:38:13** I don't know what I don't know what it means

**00:38:17** Okay, so so to explain for listeners, right can you

**00:38:21** No, no, so no, I want to i'm going to explain in like a broad way, right? Which is

**00:38:27** So what what's happening in what I buy this book and wants to deal with this spreadsheet. So

**00:38:32** Long time listeners will know I am a big booster of getting a physics degree if you can

**00:38:38** Like I think if you're the kind of person who is interested in physics at all. I highly recommend you get a physics degree

**00:38:45** and one of the main reasons for that is that

**00:38:49** People with a physics degree are just highly in demand in the world of employment

**00:38:54** Like I know people who will hire someone for a job

**00:38:58** With zero qualifications for that actual job just because they have a physics degree and it's like oh no

**00:39:03** they'll be able to like figure it out right they can they can apply stuff that they've learned and

**00:39:10** That's kind of what's going on here is like oh I did this physics degree, you know back in college and

**00:39:17** by

**00:39:18** The nature of the subject

**00:39:20** Is that it teaches you all of the useful parts of math?

**00:39:25** It's like it's the useful parts of math as they're applied to the physical world

**00:39:30** but you can just take any of these things and

**00:39:33** Apply them to other stuff

**00:39:36** And so this is one of these cases where like what i'm doing with this spreadsheet

**00:39:41** It's very much like oh a lot of stuff that you would do in physics if you were like running an experiment and you wanted to try to

**00:39:48** Publish a result and then also publish error bars on that result like it's the exact same thing

**00:39:55** It's like oh, well whether i've just taken a hundred measurements for like the weight of an electron

**00:40:00** Or it's the like sum of daily sales volume for our company

**00:40:06** It doesn't really matter what the data is

**00:40:09** There's just like a bunch of tools that you can apply

**00:40:12** And just like general principles about how to think about data

**00:40:15** And so i'd made this spreadsheet just sort of off the top of my head with a bunch of like old knowledge about mathematics and statistics

**00:40:25** and

**00:40:26** I bought this book because it I just sort of happened to come across it also at the exact moment

**00:40:31** I was just thinking about this which was i'm looking for a book

**00:40:35** Which is kind of like the equivalent of when I switched over to trying to do an economics minor

**00:40:41** I'm like, oh, can someone just give me an overview of what the mathematics in economics is?

**00:40:46** And then I can just like immediately translate all the physics stuff here. And if there's something

**00:40:51** That they're doing in a different way. It's more obvious

**00:40:55** and so

**00:40:56** this book

**00:40:57** Understanding variation key to managing chaos as best I can tell and like having skimmed through it

**00:41:02** It seems to be the case of like oh, this is someone who's just recently written a book that is basically

**00:41:09** Business math like here's just a bunch of business math

**00:41:13** And so I want to kind of read through it and just see like how are people in this field?

**00:41:19** using various statistical tools and this is one of those kind of things of like if there's a

**00:41:26** Single idea in here that is novel to me like the book is completely worth it instantly

**00:41:31** So anyway, that's why I was kind of excited. It was it was like, oh, let me just see because

**00:41:36** Almost all of these tools i'm already familiar with in a different context and it's just a bit of like

**00:41:41** Let me see. How does someone apply this?

**00:41:44** to

**00:41:45** Business stuff in general. So this book

**00:41:48** The title is the way that it is which like sounds very airy-fairy

**00:41:52** But it's trying to get across the concept of like how do you get your business under control using graphs and spreadsheets, right?

**00:41:59** How do you not be surprised?

**00:42:02** And like and that's exactly the thing that i'm trying to do here is what we need

**00:42:06** Yeah, like how do we not be surprised so important?

**00:42:09** This is so important because we spent the first kind of 18 months realistically of our business

**00:42:15** Being very surprised. Yeah, I mean and we were surprised again

**00:42:19** And I I do feel like there is no way to apply this kind of thinking to a brand new product, right?

**00:42:26** Like because there's no data that's exactly it

**00:42:28** I mean I'd have to like double check the way it went

**00:42:31** But I feel like the first three or four times we restocked the journal. We just had no idea

**00:42:36** And that data would also have been complete garbage. Like it just wouldn't have been very helpful at all. So it's

**00:42:43** There's a lot that goes on with data where it's like

**00:42:47** You need a bunch for it to be useful at all and just like having too little and especially having a thing where

**00:42:54** You're running up against a limit

**00:42:56** But you don't have even the foggiest idea of like did we just sell out or not?

**00:43:01** We couldn't have done it from the start

**00:43:02** I like one of the things that I like that you're doing with the spreadsheet is eliminating spikes from some of the data

**00:43:08** Which I think is helpful where like if we have two days where?

**00:43:12** We get a bunch more sales than usual that it's not going to be considered like well, this is the new normal

**00:43:19** Yeah, right. Like I feel like that would be such an easy way

**00:43:22** For someone to do it if they weren't trying to eliminate chaos

**00:43:26** Yeah, and again, that's like just straight from a bunch of physics stuff is like oh, you know when you conduct an experiment

**00:43:32** You're going to have some portion of the data is like outlier data and it just makes sense to get rid of that

**00:43:37** Or you just know that some results was weird for various reasons

**00:43:43** And that result doesn't help you get to what the true thing is because in some sense like

**00:43:48** What is the goal of this? It's really trying to figure out

**00:43:54** In kind of a platonic ideal world

**00:43:57** How many units of each product do we sell every day?

**00:44:02** I know actually even just explaining things to you earlier today

**00:44:05** I realized like oh actually I should bin the data by week that makes totally more sense because our data points are actually weekly sales

**00:44:10** They're not daily sales daily sales are introducing too much variation. What does bin the data mean?

**00:44:14** What are we going to do with the next version of the spreadsheet?

**00:44:17** Is right now you're entering the data points of like each product each day how many sold?

**00:44:24** But so one of the things that we can see is that there's a really big variation between

**00:44:29** Monday to saturday saturday is a disaster. Yeah, it's so interesting like no

**00:44:34** What buys the products on saturday's every saturday? Yeah, it's it's crazy. So

**00:44:41** This is also where like we sort of knew this by just like talking about and casually looking at the data

**00:44:46** Like this is a thing you told me it's like oh saturday's are bad

**00:44:50** But then what you can do with spreadsheets and graphs is be like how bad and it's like oh

**00:44:55** Very bad like the it's just so strange like

**00:44:59** Monday is great

**00:45:00** It drops a little through to friday and then saturday it just like plunges to the center of the earth and then it recovers

**00:45:06** On sunday and it really isn't like where does everybody go on saturday?

**00:45:10** No one's thinking about work on saturday, I guess but then like are they on sunday like I don't get it

**00:45:16** Yeah, shouldn't friday's also be bad like I don't get it. Yeah, I would think like friday and saturday should look the same

**00:45:21** But they don't but okay, so

**00:45:24** Whenever you're trying to figure out

**00:45:27** Anything there's like a true number, but all you can do in the real world is you can take measurements

**00:45:34** and

**00:45:35** The measurements are just like an indication of what is the real number?

**00:45:40** You know, it's it's a bit like even if you take your own weight, right you can step on a scale

**00:45:44** Twice in a row and it can be a little different, right?

**00:45:46** So like oh there is some real number that is your weight at any point in time

**00:45:52** But how precisely do you care about that and how many measurements do you want to take like that's part of the question here

**00:45:59** So there's always variation

**00:46:01** And the bigger the variation the more uncertain you are about what the real number is

**00:46:07** Now most time if you step on a scale, for example

**00:46:10** It's like oh the the weight will only vary by like a tenth of a pound or two tenths of a pound on a good scale

**00:46:16** So you can be like, all right

**00:46:17** I know my weight within this small range. So that's like good enough

**00:46:21** You only ever step on the scale once and see what the actual number is

**00:46:25** But it's just not like that with things like sales data

**00:46:28** You can't say like how many units are sold on a monday because they're all over the place

**00:46:34** and

**00:46:35** the problem with looking at our data

**00:46:38** and trying to predict a daily sales number

**00:46:42** Is that the variation between monday and saturday is really big

**00:46:48** and so that like

**00:46:50** artificially creates more uncertainty than there really is

**00:46:54** Because if we were just comparing saturday's to saturday's the variation between the sales would be smaller

**00:47:01** So what I mean is it dawned on me today that we can get more accurate measurements

**00:47:07** Of when we're going to run out of stock

**00:47:10** If instead of running all of my analysis on a what is the average day?

**00:47:16** Instead say what is the average week?

**00:47:20** Because the variation between weeks should be much smaller

**00:47:24** because we're

**00:47:26** combining together

**00:47:28** The best sales day every time and the worst sales day every time. So this is what i'm saying. It's like, okay. I should redo that

**00:47:36** Because there's just less variation between those two measurements

**00:47:40** So in some sense, it's like our real data is actually weekly

**00:47:45** Even though you're entering in daily data

**00:47:48** And so that's that's the thing that you can do in the spreadsheet is like have it filter out like, okay

**00:47:52** Before we run all the data analysis

**00:47:55** Just take the average number for the week and then

**00:47:59** Like do everything else that's going to happen afterwards with that

**00:48:01** So that's going to be the uh, that's going to be the next upgrade to the spreadsheet mic weekly binning

**00:48:05** That's what's happening there

**00:48:07** But again, I would just say too. I really love the spreadsheet

**00:48:09** But like I just I don't have a brain for this stuff

**00:48:12** But I have been thinking recently like it's part of like another reason why I think it was such a perfect partnership

**00:48:17** Because you understand this and I don't

**00:48:20** and so like

**00:48:21** You are bringing to the business this really important thing

**00:48:24** That I just would not be able to do so I think you you've totally reframed for me

**00:48:29** What problem i'm trying to solve a lot of times when I explain it because my mental framing of this is not

**00:48:36** You should trust me. It's like well that no that's ridiculous

**00:48:39** Like the whole reason to make the spreadsheet is to not trust me right to not be like

**00:48:43** Oh gray says we should buy some amount of stock and then you just

**00:48:47** Do it. It's like no. No, I want to show you here's where this is all coming from

**00:48:52** But in a partnership, I think I can reframe this like you can just trust me that i'm doing the best job

**00:48:58** on this kind of thing that I can

**00:49:00** in exactly the same way that I don't

**00:49:04** So mike

**00:49:06** When you tell me a lot about what's happening with glue binding for particular notebooks. Oh, I know

**00:49:12** I don't know what you're talking about half the time, right?

**00:49:15** But it's the same thing like I trust you to make an amazing notebook. That's your skill set

**00:49:22** Maybe it's the same thing. Like I do ask some questions about

**00:49:26** What's happening, but I think

**00:49:29** Yeah, I think maybe that's similar like i'm just kind of probing your

**00:49:33** Thought process on how it is you're putting a thing together a lot of the time you kind of ask me like why are we making that choice?

**00:49:40** Or why do you want it done this way? Like what are the benefits of doing it this way?

**00:49:44** Does it feel nicer like that kind of stuff?

**00:49:46** To ask me which is helpful, right? Because then if I can explain it to you, that's good

**00:49:50** If I can't explain it to you, then why am I making the decision?

**00:49:54** Yeah, yeah, I think we're a good partnership. I think so

**00:49:58** I think that I have this with relay too like if you can find someone

**00:50:03** Who between the two of you you can make a hole

**00:50:06** Then you're great because I think that's what it takes to run a business. You need good people

**00:50:11** around you because nobody can do everything

**00:50:16** It's just not possible and I think you are best off

**00:50:19** Finding a group of people whether it's two or three or four or more

**00:50:24** Who are all good at certain things?

**00:50:27** And you put them together and you become better as a whole like I think that's what's truly valuable

**00:50:35** There is no such thing as an as a excellent all-rounder. You can get someone who might be good at a bunch of things

**00:50:41** But you would be able to get a set of individual people who are all individually better at each thing. That's what I believe

**00:50:48** This episode is brought to you by fit bud

**00:53:07** So I just made a 100 year of the weekend focus decision

**00:53:13** Yeah, where in it I was like, oh i'm super happy about the theme that i've chosen

**00:53:19** So right now I actually think i'm in the busiest month of my year

**00:53:25** Maybe with the exception of september because of podcastathon stuff, right?

**00:53:30** But for regular work this month wild right so two episodes of cortex. That's enough

**00:53:38** right like

**00:53:39** Put two episodes of cortex in one month

**00:53:41** That's enough for me let alone all of the other stuff that i'm doing and preparing for wwbc

**00:53:47** All right

**00:53:47** So I have big episodes of my regular apple focus shows where we turn both of our predictions episodes into games

**00:53:55** They take a lot of work to do

**00:53:57** They're really important to me. I love doing them, but it's big stuff, right?

**00:54:00** This is like trying and then trying to get ready for like a basically a two-week trip

**00:54:04** There's a lot of a lot going on right now

**00:54:06** Mm-hmm, but I took a mini vacation in the middle of it

**00:54:09** Yeah, which is on paper to me like previous mic terrible idea

**00:54:14** Like if you're that busy, would you take four days out of your week to go and join somebody on a vacation?

**00:54:22** Like there's a four days where you could be preparing more where you could be editing where you could be recording

**00:54:29** We could have recorded this show last week rather than this week, which would have given me longer before we got to get it out like

**00:54:35** These are things where previous me on paper would have been like no way take the time to work

**00:54:42** The year of the weekend mic is realizing the value in taking breaks

**00:54:47** And what has ended up happening is taking a three to four day

**00:54:52** Vacation in the middle of one of the busiest months in the year has put a split down the middle

**00:54:57** So instead of being a really busy four weeks, it was busy too busy too

**00:55:02** And I was able to recharge in the middle of it. So

**00:55:05** Friend of ours friend to the world underscore David Smith the maker of widget Smith

**00:55:11** He just celebrated a big birthday

**00:55:13** In Scotland and he invited me and adena to come along and spend it with him as a family and friends

**00:55:18** And so that was one of these things I was like that is an honor

**00:55:21** You can't turn down something like that if a friend asks you I feel if it's somebody that you care about

**00:55:26** And they want you to join them on something that's important to them

**00:55:29** You do everything you can to try and do it and so I did it and I was a couple of days into this

**00:55:34** Wonderful time in the Scottish Highlands in this beautiful home of all these this wonderful nature around me

**00:55:40** And I was like this was a good idea

**00:55:44** Because it's allowed me to have this recharge

**00:55:48** To now this final stint before heading off to san francisco for wwc

**00:55:54** Oh, man, I feel like you've taken your theme very seriously. I don't know if I could have done that in your position

**00:56:00** You're right when you get a serious invitation. I think you're right. You have to take it seriously and say yes

**00:56:06** But man, I would I would have been

**00:56:09** Very nervous about that. Yeah, and I understand it. This doesn't fit with you right now

**00:56:13** This is the exact opposite of the year of work

**00:56:17** But what I have realized is that i'm just at a point where

**00:56:21** That kind of burning the candle at both ends is just not good for me right now

**00:56:26** It has been and in the future it will be again

**00:56:28** I have no doubt about that

**00:56:30** But I believe that our lives roll in these cycles and the cycle that i'm in right now demands of me

**00:56:36** To take better care of myself

**00:56:39** So this was like a perfect example of that where?

**00:56:42** I will now be in a couple of weeks getting ready to go on a plane and i'm going to feel nice and prepared

**00:56:47** and ready and fresh

**00:56:49** where

**00:56:50** I would have felt at my wit's end. I think otherwise if I would have been working solid all the way through

**00:56:58** I mean it does help that I am taking my weekends

**00:57:00** But similarly because we've got two episodes of cortex in a month

**00:57:04** They are reduced weekend times a little bit because I do edit mostly on the weekends

**00:57:09** So again, like having these few days is making sure I still make up for those days that i'd otherwise be losing

**00:57:15** Which is i've been very good at that if i'm taking a work day on the weekend

**00:57:19** I am still taking my weekdays, but this has been like a little life hack for me now where i've banked four days

**00:57:26** So I can now spend those

**00:57:28** weekend days throughout the rest of the month also I saw

**00:57:32** Something i've never seen before the most incredible rainbow

**00:57:35** I have ever experienced i'm sending you a couple of pictures of this rainbow in scotland in scotland

**00:57:42** Even better than hawaii rainbows. I was like you've been to hawaii

**00:57:45** I have never been this close to a rainbow where I genuinely felt like

**00:57:51** I could see where it ended

**00:57:54** And I also I think another picture could see the entire arc of the rainbow

**00:58:00** Which again is like another thing. I have never experienced before. That's a really good one

**00:58:05** It's a good rainbow, right? I guess I guess I don't really think of scotland as rainbow territory

**00:58:09** But of course, it's like it's very misty. So it's got to be great rainbow territory. Well, the weather was

**00:58:15** Surprisingly incredible the entire time like nice and warm

**00:58:20** Just only a little bit windy no rain, you know, so we didn't get out of here. We got the full highland experience

**00:58:27** but

**00:58:27** overall excellent

**00:58:29** And that rainbow man, come on

**00:58:33** Does look like just past the tree line is a pot of gold

**00:58:37** It actually looks like it's on top of the house in this image

**00:58:40** Because the rainbow is in front of those trees. You can see the colors of the rainbow is affecting the way those trees look

**00:58:47** Oh

**00:58:50** This is very charming like I had a great time and it was so helpful for me

**00:58:54** And I think that like this is a really really good thing for me to consider in the future

**00:59:01** I was gonna ask like it sort of sounded crazy to me when I knew that you were going to do this

**00:59:05** Like right before and and right in the middle of this really busy time, but it does seem to have worked out great for you

**00:59:11** so

**00:59:13** I think if you're thinking that this was a good thing and you want to do it in the future

**00:59:19** This is something you've got to lock into the calendar now

**00:59:23** because

**00:59:24** Future mic will have plenty of reasons why it's not a good time to take a break. Yeah, but that's why I feel like

**00:59:31** current mic needs to

**00:59:34** Lock future mic in in a way where it's hard to say no like that's the favor that underscore did for you here which is

**00:59:41** It was not just that like oh he he whisked you away to a magical rainbow land

**00:59:46** It's that you also just like couldn't say no and so like that makes the trip like this is gonna happen

**00:59:51** I'm gonna make it happen

**00:59:52** Yeah, I think what I would take away from this is like if I have something like this going on

**00:59:56** And I will try and apply this for say the podcasters on

**01:00:01** Is to before like a huge trip like this with it i'm under a lot of pressure and there's a lot of expectation

**01:00:07** Maybe take a little short city break go to london for the weekend the weekend before

**01:00:11** And just use it as an opportunity to just like switch off for a couple of days

**01:00:16** You know and like get out of home, right?

**01:00:18** Don't just spend the weekend at home like go and just like be in a different environment

**01:00:23** And not have to think about work try and get out of the work mode

**01:00:28** Get out of that mindset. I think that that is like a nice little addition to this like year of the weekend mentality of

**01:00:35** In these high intense scenarios create a little special weekend in a way

**01:00:42** So I think i'm gonna i'm gonna try and think about more about how that will be

**01:00:46** Because when it's you know, some of these things they can be so

**01:00:49** Intense like wwc is gonna be intense

**01:00:52** September will be super intense, you know, because again, it's like the podcast that's on and the iphone tend to line up with each other

**01:00:58** It's like two really important things. So trying to find ways to

**01:01:03** Take these breaks I think is gonna is gonna be a nice little addition and an important thing

**01:01:08** To ensure that the year of the weekend is being observed. This really is a beautiful rainbow

**01:01:13** Just like I'm just like leaving it on my i've never seen one like that

**01:01:18** Like i've seen some great rainbows in hawaii

**01:01:21** But that that has got some strong colors like that's the thing about it is the colors are so strong

**01:01:26** So in the first image that I sent you I have boosted the color of it to like really show it

**01:01:32** But this is akin to how it looked to my eye when I saw it

**01:01:35** But but the thing is also you can like if you look at you've got the roygy bit of colors

**01:01:40** But you can see them start to repeat again, which is like

**01:01:43** Really shows the strength of the rainbow, right? That like rainbows. I forget the exact details of this but like

**01:01:50** Every rainbow you're looking at

**01:01:52** Is a multiple rainbow. It's just that the colors are too faint for you to be able to see but it's like it's a

**01:01:58** Repeated effect, but you can only ever see the one

**01:02:01** But that's why it really catches my eye here of like it must have been very strong in person to be able to see like

**01:02:08** Immediately below the start of the pattern again

**01:02:11** Very magical and it was just one of those things where like 12 adults were turned into children

**01:02:17** Because we're just like this thing. There's just this unbelievable

**01:02:21** Because it really like seeing the end like that made it feel fake

**01:02:27** Yeah in a way like i've never experienced

**01:02:30** A rainbow that felt so physically close to me. It was it's kind of awesome

**01:02:34** I'm going to imagine you and underscore as the double rainbow across the sky guy taking a look at this in scotland

**01:02:41** I've been asking cortex to submit questions over at cortexfeedback.com where they can submit ask cortex questions for us with our fancy form

**01:02:50** Jamie wrote in to ask do you have any advice on how to keep a daily task list shorter?

**01:02:57** I'm thinking about not just the most important tasks, but also the one-time tasks at the moment

**01:03:02** I end up having an entire walkthrough of my day along with a wish list of nice to have things that I want to do

**01:03:08** Overall i'm looking at over 20 task items per day and it's just unrealistic that i'm going to get to them all

**01:03:15** No, Jamie, so

**01:03:18** I think for all of us is just completely unavoidable that you always feel like my task list is way too long

**01:03:25** Basically, no matter what you're doing. So I think I would suggest

**01:03:29** Two ideas here one for me the main idea, which I think I first talked about in my time management for teachers video

**01:03:37** Which is still up on my youtube channel

**01:03:40** Yeah, it's still there. It's it's still survived. Is that a public video? Yeah, it's a public video incredible

**01:03:46** It's also very funny to see like oh it still hasn't hit a million views

**01:03:52** That's like my oldest video any day now

**01:03:55** But there's an idea that I sort of talk about in there, which I want to like elaborate on a little bit, which is

**01:04:01** Your to-do list is functionally infinite in many ways

**01:04:05** But there's like a clear dividing line in my mind. That's critical

**01:04:10** That dividing line is the like I can't go home today

**01:04:15** Or I can't finish the work day until these items are done

**01:04:20** like that's that's the one

**01:04:23** really hard boundary

**01:04:26** For looking at to-do list items like

**01:04:29** It just has to be mission critical that this gets done today

**01:04:32** I cannot go home

**01:04:34** and the the thing that you can kind of like mentally use to try to identify those items is it's like

**01:04:40** These are the things that I would stay late at work for or keep working longer to

**01:04:46** Finish because they're just like

**01:04:48** Absolutely vital, but of course you don't want to

**01:04:52** Just do those items. So a thing that I didn't mention in that old video, but I think is also useful for the like

**01:04:58** What things have to be on the list is it's not just those but it's also the tasks that you know

**01:05:06** save you a

**01:05:08** significant amount of time and stress the following day so like

**01:05:13** I think whenever i'm talking to people about to-do lists

**01:05:17** It's like those are the two things that i'm looking for for like when someone's trying to put together like what am I going to do today?

**01:05:23** it's like

**01:05:25** Absolutely mission critical and the stuff that is going to save you a significant amount of time and stress

**01:05:32** tomorrow

**01:05:33** Even if it doesn't have to happen today

**01:05:36** And I don't know for me like again in my old teaching job the classic example of saving time and stress tomorrow

**01:05:43** For me was always like

**01:05:45** If you need to make photocopies of anything for tomorrow's classes don't wait until tomorrow

**01:05:51** Because it's just always a nightmare right and like causes you these problems of like

**01:05:56** Oh, there's a big line at the copier or the copier isn't working, right?

**01:05:59** Like you can really screw yourself over by waiting until the last minute with something like that

**01:06:04** I think those are like the two things that you really want to focus on

**01:06:09** but for the rest of the list i'm gonna suggest a kind of

**01:06:14** Mental reframing of what to-do lists are

**01:06:19** and

**01:06:20** In order to do this i'm gonna use an example from one of my favorite things to pull examples from ever

**01:06:27** Magic the Gathering of course this doesn't come up in a while

**01:06:31** That's how you know by the way if we're doing a special episode or a regular episode

**01:06:35** It's just gray reference Magic the Gathering is a metaphor or not

**01:06:39** Uh that might not be unfair. Yeah, it might not be unfair at all

**01:06:43** Okay, so in Magic the Gathering

**01:06:46** My absolute favorite mechanism of the game is something that most players consider quite banal and boring

**01:06:53** But it is something called

**01:06:55** Scry and

**01:06:58** Scry is the ability to

**01:07:00** look at the top cards of your deck and

**01:07:04** Rearrange their order or put some of them on the bottom

**01:07:07** And I love this so much in the game and I love this as an as a concept that I think is just

**01:07:14** Applicable everywhere. It's one of the very few words of the game that I like

**01:07:20** has so

**01:07:21** Dug itself into my brain. I sometimes just use it in conversation without clarification

**01:07:27** And then feel real awkward when someone is like what the hell did you just say about like scrying your list?

**01:07:33** Like oh no, this is very embarrassing

**01:07:35** but

**01:07:36** The thing about this is like the concept that is trying to express here is

**01:07:41** In most games of Magic you're never getting to the bottom of your deck

**01:07:46** The thing that you're really concerned about is like what is the order of the next?

**01:07:52** Two to five things that's going to happen

**01:07:56** and I think people should just think about their to-do lists

**01:07:59** as

**01:08:01** a list of

**01:08:02** Cards that they're scrying through your job is not to get through all of these to-do items. Your job is to

**01:08:09** Arrange them in the correct order and sometimes that means like oh you're looking at something and

**01:08:17** Just like in scry you put a card on the bottom of the deck because you don't want it right now

**01:08:21** It's like you're going to take this to-do list item and you're going to put it at the bottom of the deck and

**01:08:26** Probably you're going to die before you get to that to-do list item, right?

**01:08:31** But that's fine. Right? Like that's just what life is like

**01:08:35** I think you're doing life wrong

**01:08:37** if you're

**01:08:39** Consistently getting to the bottom of your to-do list. Damn

**01:08:44** Oh, that's good

**01:08:45** There is something about that that is really interesting to me where I don't know if you're saying it this way but like

**01:08:52** If it's like an ambition thing, yeah, you've done all of your to-do items, then you're not reaching for something else

**01:08:59** That's exactly the way I mean it is if your to-do list is empty

**01:09:03** Something about your life is wrong and it's probably that you're not reaching hard enough or you're just not thinking about the

**01:09:12** Just like the scope of things that you can actually do. Yeah, so this might be like in a game of magic

**01:09:18** The games always end and like most games players still have cards in their deck

**01:09:23** You know that like in an average game you're only going to ever get through like at most you're only going to see

**01:09:29** 40 percent of the cards in your deck in a normal game

**01:09:33** But you still have more cards in the deck than that and it's just like it's the same with life, right?

**01:09:39** I would imagine you have some in your hand, right? It's like oh, I had some plans here

**01:09:42** Like I was gonna do some cool stuff if it came around, but I just never got the chance

**01:09:46** Yeah, exactly. I like this. This is a good way of thinking about it. I feel very confident about this of like

**01:09:52** People are framing this wrong and I used to frame this wrong of feeling guilty that at the end of every day

**01:10:00** I didn't

**01:10:01** complete my to-do lists, but I just I think that's totally wrong your actual job is like

**01:10:07** arranging the correct order of the next things that you want to work on and

**01:10:13** That means putting some things at the bottom of the list, which you're just never going to get to and that's fine

**01:10:20** That's totally fine. In fact, it's way better than the alternative of having an empty to-do list

**01:10:28** Man, I love that. I really i'm gonna be thinking about that a lot

**01:10:32** That's like a really good metaphor

**01:10:33** Like it's not too dissimilar to how I am because i'm just realistic about like I know I always have more on my to-do list

**01:10:40** And I have time to fit into a day

**01:10:42** But i'm able to look at my list and I know what is like absolutely must be done and everything else is movable

**01:10:50** Or like I can do a little bit of it today. I won't finish it

**01:10:53** So i'll get it closer to the point where I can check it off

**01:10:56** I don't feel

**01:10:57** guilty about there being things because I know I have come to accept that

**01:11:03** I never have a day where I complete every item on my to-do list

**01:11:07** It just doesn't happen

**01:11:09** Because I just know that there's always more to go if I want to find time for it and i'm that works for me

**01:11:14** Great, but I know I just know by being able to look at things. What is the most important?

**01:11:19** And sometimes I flag them, you know

**01:11:21** I can to-do list I can change the color of a thing if I need to be able to have something stand out to me

**01:11:26** I can do that, but I do think it's a skill that you have to learn over time

**01:11:31** There are some truths about the world you have to accept first and I think what you have

**01:11:36** Perfectly encapsulate is one of those of like it's realistically just not possible for you to do it all

**01:11:41** Once you've accepted that you can then start to better prioritize

**01:11:45** Yeah, and I still want to say like there's just a slightly different framing here, which is the like

**01:11:50** It's not that you don't feel guilty for not having completed the thing. No, no, no

**01:11:55** This is the way it should be like you should end every day with more things on your to-do list

**01:12:02** Than you were able to do

**01:12:04** The real question is did you order things properly for the day? Not did you get everything done for the day?

**01:14:28** Jen's asks Apple is rumored to be working on a journaling app. Have you ever considered making your own digital journaling app?

**01:14:37** Have we Mike?

**01:14:40** We'll be doing a lot of work with the word considered

**01:14:43** So let me just I will reference this by saying there is a suggestion that Apple is going to be making a brand new app

**01:14:48** Which will be journaling focused. It will prompt you to write down things in the day

**01:14:52** but also like

**01:14:53** collect up information about where you've been and who you've been with and like

**01:14:57** Pre-populate some of that stuff. It's an interesting idea

**01:14:59** Like I actually like it as an idea for a journaling app

**01:15:03** Although I do have some questions about like will anybody else be able to use this information?

**01:15:09** Apple's putting into their own journaling app

**01:15:11** But we'll see about that one and so i'm super intrigued to see what that's all about

**01:15:15** In regards to making a theme system journal app

**01:15:19** No

**01:15:20** Right. Like I mean how have we considered it in a sense of making a decision on it? Yes

**01:15:26** And the decision is we're not interested in doing it. Yeah, we've discussed it, but I think every discussion has been a

**01:15:34** rather

**01:15:35** Unambiguous. No that this this just doesn't make sense for us to do in this company as a as a project for

**01:15:42** A whole bunch of reasons

**01:15:44** The main one for me personally is I just think that this stuff is better when you are making an intentional decision to sit down with a

**01:15:53** Set of things a pen and a notepad or a book or a journal of some kind

**01:15:58** Yeah, like get your phone away from you and sit and write down how you're feeling what you're thinking about

**01:16:03** Like I think that that is important and it's like honestly for me

**01:16:08** The act of doing that thing is part of what is important about doing it

**01:16:14** Anyway that you are choosing to sit down and do this thing

**01:16:18** Where I feel like if my phone is sending me a notification

**01:16:22** To remind me to write in a journal and then I tap that and I write in my journal and press like set like it

**01:16:28** Just feels like any thing that I have on my phone. I have a daily to-do

**01:16:33** Task to write in my journal

**01:16:36** But that doesn't then mean that I open good notes and start writing with the apple pencil like i've never done that

**01:16:42** I like to be able to sit down with this

**01:16:45** item that I care about that I look after that is mine

**01:16:49** And that I can see has got my handwriting in it and is filled up at the end. I think that that

**01:16:54** Is an important practice like a thing to do so that is one of the reasons the other is just

**01:17:00** Have you heard about the economics of the app store?

**01:17:03** Yeah, it would take a lot of time and money to make an app

**01:17:08** Which is a high enough quality that we would put our name on this is similar to the physical product stuff, right?

**01:17:14** Me and you are going to have an app that's cortex brand

**01:17:17** It's got to be really good that we would be happy with it. So that's going to be expensive to make

**01:17:23** and then like

**01:17:25** Trying to run that as a business

**01:17:27** I don't I don't know if I want to do that

**01:17:30** To be honest, I feel confident in being able to work with people to produce these products that we have

**01:17:37** Making an app to a high quality just feels like a completely different thing

**01:17:41** But also is not a thing that I particularly want to put my energy into because it's

**01:17:48** it would feel

**01:17:51** For like there's no good way of saying this without me sounding like

**01:17:54** Look at this guy, but it would feel like it wasn't true to what I believe

**01:18:00** for the theme system

**01:18:02** I believe it is best used

**01:18:06** when

**01:18:07** Using our journal or another notebook. I'm thinking in this way of like I have a yearly theme

**01:18:14** And every day i'm going to sit and write in my thing that is focused around my theme

**01:18:19** And it's going to help guide me because i'm taking that intentional time every day to think about it

**01:18:24** And just write down how i'm feeling how i'm getting on I think that that is important

**01:18:28** And I think the act of writing it down is the important part

**01:18:32** By sitting and making that intention rather than just being like let me open my app

**01:18:37** I don't know. I can imagine so many people are listening to me and they don't see a difference

**01:18:42** that's fine, but I feel this way and

**01:18:47** I'm part of the decision making of the things that we're doing. Yeah, and I back you on this like I agree

**01:18:53** There's a lot of problems with the economics of this

**01:18:57** again

**01:18:58** Largely stemming from how would the two of us want this to be done?

**01:19:03** This is not a question of like is it possible to make an app that is vaguely this

**01:19:09** it's a question of

**01:19:11** Making it the way that we would want to be which is very different

**01:19:15** But I do also agree with you that I think behavior change is really hard for people. It's especially difficult in

**01:19:24** absence of

**01:19:25** signals to yourself that you're really trying to

**01:19:29** Do something differently?

**01:19:32** And for most people

**01:19:34** in the current modern world

**01:19:36** It's

**01:19:38** Having a notebook that is a physical object

**01:19:41** I think is a real signal to their own brain to pay attention that something is different here

**01:19:46** Yeah, you know, sometimes you try to think about like who are you making?

**01:19:50** products for and like who are you trying to help with things and I sometimes

**01:19:56** imagine a kind of customer that I can easily imagine as like a younger version of myself as well like

**01:20:01** Someone who is like really tech oriented and spends a lot of time around electronics like just like I did

**01:20:09** but is also

**01:20:11** dissatisfied with life in various ways and it's having a hard time like changing themselves and

**01:20:19** To buy a physical notebook

**01:20:22** Which itself acts as a physical reminder in your real life space about something that you're trying to do

**01:20:28** I think it really shows your brain like this is different from all of the other things in your environment

**01:20:35** Take it seriously

**01:20:36** And so I think for that kind of customer the fact that it is a physical object

**01:20:42** Is much more helpful to them in terms of enacting actual change

**01:20:48** and that

**01:20:50** I can kind of imagine that selling an app even if it is profitable might be a

**01:20:56** Might be a disservice to that exact kind of customer because it would be less helpful to them

**01:21:02** because it is less distinct and like

**01:21:06** Something needs to be different is the whole thing about why you might be buying this which is why it helps that it's a physical product

**01:21:14** So I think we're in agreement

**01:21:16** No app of the theme system and we sell the theme system journal use any notebook you like we're not using this

**01:21:22** Time to try and sell you on it like watch grays video he explains it

**01:21:26** But like that is an important part to the two of us

**01:21:28** Yeah, and that's also why like i've talked about that. We've talked about that. We obviously sell a notebook

**01:21:34** But I like I don't know. I don't I don't want to get all cheesy here, but I really do feel it like

**01:21:40** I feel very strongly about

**01:21:44** wanting to

**01:21:45** try and help people to be happier and to live more satisfied lives because

**01:21:51** I know I could have had a really bad time in life and

**01:21:57** These kinds of things if you catch someone at the right time with them are literally life-changing

**01:22:03** It's important to me that people try this kind of stuff

**01:22:06** Obviously, we want to sell notebooks, but I care a lot more that

**01:22:10** Someone who needs it like gives this a try and maybe it's helpful to them and you can just do it on anything

**01:22:17** But not an app

**01:22:22** Ian asks a fairy or member of the appropriate government agency

**01:22:27** Grants you an extra employee at no cost to you that has whatever skill set you need

**01:22:34** What part of what you do now would you offload to them and why?

**01:22:39** Oh

**01:22:42** What would you say to this so

**01:22:44** This is the key of why like it's a fairy. Okay, so it's like there's magic involved. There's magic involved, right?

**01:22:51** Okay

**01:22:52** What I would want is someone who could help me

**01:22:55** with show production in like finding interesting stories

**01:23:00** To talk about helping me think about and expand on certain topics

**01:23:04** Like what's some interesting stuff that we could talk about?

**01:23:07** The reason we need a fairy for this is because this person needs to think and work like me exactly

**01:23:13** Because I wouldn't want to work with anyone like this if they didn't share my exact thinking

**01:23:18** Which is why I have no actual desire to find a producer

**01:23:22** Because I like the way that I think about topics for my shows. Would I like it if there were two of me?

**01:23:29** Great, right? Other than that, right?

**01:23:31** This isn't a role that I would be looking to fill because I want to still be involved

**01:23:36** But if there's someone who already thinks like me then I'm already doing it, you know, that's why that's the fairy part

**01:23:41** Yeah, if there's okay if there's magic involved, this is in some sense an easier but exactly

**01:23:47** That's helpful

**01:23:48** Because there's magic involved right so

**01:23:52** If there's magic involved what I would want is a

**01:23:56** First draft script writer that would be the thing that I would want. Right? See there we go

**01:24:02** You know again, it's like do the first part but think like me. Yes

**01:24:07** Exactly. Yeah, it's like I mentioned this before but like my skill is not writing my skill is editing

**01:24:13** and so getting to the point where there's the first what I think of as readable draft

**01:24:19** is

**01:24:20** so much work and it's so hard and

**01:24:24** The problem is like that first draft. It's the same thing you have like there's there's a certain kind of quality that i'm looking for

**01:24:30** and

**01:24:31** I know people are always like oh, but you can hire writers and

**01:24:35** It's like look i'm just gonna say like I know youtube channels who have brought on other writers and even when they're reasonably good

**01:24:42** it's like but they're just

**01:24:44** Never quite the same as the person who started the thing. Of course and like you can just feel

**01:24:51** channels getting a little bland

**01:24:54** Or it's just like it just feels a little different and very often it's like ah, they brought on more writers

**01:24:59** It's like it's just changed

**01:25:01** So I think that's the thing that I would want most if there was like a magic employee

**01:25:05** It would be the like i'll give you that's like i'll keep doing the selection like i'll pick something

**01:25:11** But if you can give me like a first draft that I can start editing from that would be amazing

**01:25:17** But that would also be basically magic
