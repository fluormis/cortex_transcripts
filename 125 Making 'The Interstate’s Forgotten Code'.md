# Cortex - 125: Making 'The Interstateâ€™s Forgotten Code'
**00:00:00** There's a new grey video.

**00:00:01** There is.

**00:00:02** Congratulations.

**00:00:03** Thank you.

**00:00:04** The wanderer has returned.

**00:00:06** Yeah, it's an actual real animated video.

**00:00:09** I was thinking about this because I

**00:00:11** was trying to put it in your terms for these things.

**00:00:14** You know, I wanted to say, what was the last one?

**00:00:19** Like the actual real full last, what

**00:00:22** you would consider regular video?

**00:00:25** Yeah, it's whenever Tiffany was.

**00:00:27** That was like the last real video.

**00:00:29** The follow up to that video, you don't class as one of these

**00:00:33** because it was also grey in the real world a bit, right?

**00:00:37** Yeah, this is where I have my completely nonsense categories

**00:00:40** that mean nothing to anyone else.

**00:00:43** I'm even getting confused.

**00:00:44** The way I'm trying to work this out

**00:00:46** is by looking at the thumbnails on your YouTube page.

**00:00:51** But there isn't consistency to those even.

**00:00:53** I have a very clear system for differences

**00:00:56** that nobody cares about.

**00:00:57** There's quote, real videos which have the little side

**00:01:02** banner with the grey logo.

**00:01:05** That is the grey version of the grey logo.

**00:01:08** There's grey goes outside videos which

**00:01:11** have the green version of the grey logo.

**00:01:14** But in my head, those aren't real videos,

**00:01:16** even when in the case like with the testing Tesla video where

**00:01:20** I spend as much time on a grey goes outside video

**00:01:23** as I would on a real video.

**00:01:25** And then there's the videos that don't get a sidebar, which

**00:01:29** I categorize as light grey videos.

**00:01:32** Those are like extra videos.

**00:01:34** Those are also not real videos, even though like with someone

**00:01:40** dead ruined my life again, where they might take four times

**00:01:44** as much effort as a real video.

**00:01:46** So this categorization system makes a lot of sense.

**00:01:49** I think you need another category.

**00:01:51** What other category do I need?

**00:01:52** So like a category that would include someone dead ruined

**00:01:55** my life again.

**00:01:56** That's a light grey video.

**00:01:57** But it doesn't have a sidebar thing.

**00:02:00** Right.

**00:02:01** That's how you know it's a light grey video.

**00:02:03** But that and the uncut Tesla self-driving bay

**00:02:06** are on urban roads.

**00:02:07** They are completely different.

**00:02:09** No, it's all extra stuff.

**00:02:12** Those are all the same sorts of things.

**00:02:13** Because that someone dead video took ages to make.

**00:02:17** And the uncut Tesla self-drive, it's just like you just,

**00:02:20** that didn't do any work on that, surely.

**00:02:22** Look, the category of light grey videos is very clear.

**00:02:26** I created that category for some light and easy

**00:02:30** to make videos.

**00:02:31** And now I also put stuff like someone dead ruined my life.

**00:02:34** Right, exactly.

**00:02:35** So I think the light grey thing is fine,

**00:02:38** of like this is additional stuff.

**00:02:40** But then like there is another, I

**00:02:43** don't know why someone dead ruined my life again

**00:02:45** isn't a gooey goes outside video.

**00:02:46** Well, I didn't go outside.

**00:02:48** Yeah, you did.

**00:02:48** You're in the library and stuff in that one, right?

**00:02:51** I mean, OK, yeah, I guess I did go outside.

**00:02:54** It doesn't feel like it.

**00:02:57** Because I would also argue that sharks

**00:02:59** is in the wrong category.

**00:03:01** You've put that as a gray goes outside video.

**00:03:03** And I don't think it is.

**00:03:04** I think it should be a regular video.

**00:03:06** OK, you have raised an excellent point here.

**00:03:08** Because sharks, I have categorized

**00:03:10** as gray goes outside because I found the sharks outside.

**00:03:19** It was like, oh, but the entire interstate highway

**00:03:23** system of America, that's definitely inside that one.

**00:03:27** Well, no, but OK, that one's clear.

**00:03:29** That one's all animated, right?

**00:03:30** That's different.

**00:03:31** But I'm realizing, as you say it,

**00:03:34** it never occurred to me that someone dead ruined my life

**00:03:36** should be a gray goes outside video.

**00:03:38** Because that's ridiculous.

**00:03:39** That's not a gray goes outside video.

**00:03:41** But I 100% spent more time outside of my office

**00:03:48** working on the someone dead ruined my life again

**00:03:50** video than I did for the sharks video.

**00:03:54** See, because my argument is both someone dead and sharks,

**00:03:57** they should be regular videos.

**00:04:00** Because they are so different to the vlog videos

**00:04:04** that you've done.

**00:04:05** I don't think that they, not that I'm saying anything

**00:04:08** bad about your vlog videos.

**00:04:09** But I think you are doing those videos a disservice

**00:04:12** in your mind by thinking of them that way.

**00:04:15** Because I also think it would, let's

**00:04:17** imagine you as a person who tracks everything.

**00:04:20** If you tracked those videos as gray goes outside,

**00:04:23** it completely tips the scale, I think,

**00:04:26** of what those videos should be.

**00:04:28** The two Tesla ones you've done, really, being outliers,

**00:04:32** they both took way longer than they should have.

**00:04:35** But your other ones, like your Escape

**00:04:36** From Lockdown or the video when you got vaccinated,

**00:04:39** they no way took tons and tons and tons of time,

**00:04:43** because they're simpler.

**00:04:45** So then, like, sharks and someone dead,

**00:04:48** they took, must have taken ages, because they had

**00:04:51** a little animation stuff in them.

**00:04:52** Yeah, yeah, no, they took forever.

**00:04:54** So they don't feel like gray goes outside.

**00:04:57** Also, I found another category.

**00:04:58** Well, I know there's a game one.

**00:04:59** I'm talking about that.

**00:05:00** There's one that's blue.

**00:05:01** What's the blue one?

**00:05:03** Oh, the blue is Q&A videos.

**00:05:04** Right, OK.

**00:05:06** Well, but thinking about, is thinking about lockdowns,

**00:05:08** is that a Q&A video?

**00:05:10** The problem with the Q&A that's thinking about lockdowns

**00:05:14** the reason it's 13 minutes long is that 100%

**00:05:17** should have been two videos, because that one starts

**00:05:21** with like six minutes of just actually what the title is.

**00:05:25** It's like, oh, here's how to think about lockdowns

**00:05:27** in a general way.

**00:05:28** And then it just segues into a Q&A for no reason.

**00:05:31** So that video is one of those things in retrospect,

**00:05:34** you look at it as like the person who made it and you go,

**00:05:37** why did I put those two together?

**00:05:40** It's because I was making them at the same,

**00:05:42** like I was writing this as one big script

**00:05:44** and the section at the start just kept getting bigger

**00:05:46** and bigger.

**00:05:47** I totally should have cut that into two, but no,

**00:05:49** the blue one, that's blue because thinking about lockdowns

**00:05:53** is a Q&A video, even though you don't find out

**00:05:57** until six minutes in.

**00:05:59** Spaceship U has no categorization on its thumbnail.

**00:06:03** Yeah, I put that as an extra video.

**00:06:05** That's a light gray video.

**00:06:07** What are you talking about?

**00:06:09** Oh, man.

**00:06:10** I don't know.

**00:06:11** It just feels like it's a light gray video.

**00:06:12** I'm not saying that this categorization system

**00:06:15** has some real solid borders here.

**00:06:17** Why you couldn't say that.

**00:06:19** How machines learn, the bar is on the other side.

**00:06:23** And why die?

**00:06:24** The little gray logo is on the other side.

**00:06:26** I was not expecting to review the thumbnails

**00:06:28** of your channel today, but now I'm fascinated by it.

**00:06:32** This is actually one of these things, I am shocked.

**00:06:34** I don't get a thousand comments about this all the time

**00:06:36** about moving the logo.

**00:06:38** And it's one of these things I just thought everyone

**00:06:40** would notice and lose their minds that I swap sides,

**00:06:43** but basically no one has ever commented on it.

**00:06:45** I found another category.

**00:06:46** Okay.

**00:06:47** Lord of the Rings.

**00:06:49** It's just gold.

**00:06:50** You've just made the logo gold in those ones.

**00:06:52** Yeah, that's just to match the Lord of the Rings.

**00:06:54** I know, but it's funny, but now we have another category now.

**00:06:57** We have a Lord of the Rings category.

**00:06:59** That's not a separate category.

**00:07:00** That's the main Gray Explains video.

**00:07:02** I don't need to justify my thumbnails.

**00:07:05** Well.

**00:07:07** But I kind of do.

**00:07:07** I think we need to know.

**00:07:09** We started it, but I do consider Lord of the Rings

**00:07:11** its own category now though.

**00:07:13** So there's gray, light gray, gray girls outside,

**00:07:16** Lord of the Rings.

**00:07:18** I'm going to assume by the way, you have not watched

**00:07:21** and will not watch the trailer for the Lord of the Rings show.

**00:07:24** I have no interest in that show.

**00:07:26** That show is doomed from the moment it was conceived.

**00:07:29** I have a big problem with the trailer.

**00:07:31** Okay.

**00:07:32** What's your problem with the trailer?

**00:07:33** It's like a semantic thing where they're trying to make it

**00:07:36** like it's this cool, smart thing that they're doing,

**00:07:38** but really it makes no sense to me.

**00:07:40** So they're showing a bunch of footage or whatever.

**00:07:42** This is before the fellowship, before the King.

**00:07:47** That doesn't make any sense.

**00:07:48** Before the ring.

**00:07:49** So there's a lot of Kings in the Lord of the Rings universe.

**00:07:53** It wasn't just the one.

**00:07:54** It's not like before the ring.

**00:07:56** The show is about the rings.

**00:07:57** Like that's the whole thing, right?

**00:08:00** So it's quote, but like this show is called

**00:08:03** the rings of power.

**00:08:05** So sure, maybe they didn't make the ring yet or whatever,

**00:08:08** but obviously the, anyway,

**00:08:09** they're just trying to make it seem like

**00:08:11** before the three movies,

**00:08:13** but I think it just sounds so stupid, right?

**00:08:15** Before the ring, the Lord of the Rings.

**00:08:17** It's like, well, why, what are they the Lord of

**00:08:19** if there are no rings?

**00:08:20** Yeah.

**00:08:21** And I understand, like I get it, right?

**00:08:24** Like it's, I'm sure this is set before the rings

**00:08:26** were even a thing, but then it's just funny to call it

**00:08:29** the Lord of the Rings then, isn't it?

**00:08:30** Which I think inherently is maybe the concern you have over

**00:08:34** it, which is like,

**00:08:35** they actually can't tell any of the stories

**00:08:38** that anybody loves, I guess,

**00:08:40** cause they can't use,

**00:08:41** Amazon will not love to use any of the characters.

**00:08:44** Yeah.

**00:08:44** I look at the original Lord of the Rings movies

**00:08:46** as just a miracle of adapting

**00:08:49** a completely unadaptable work.

**00:08:51** Forever in my mind,

**00:08:52** the original Lord of the Rings trilogy wins

**00:08:54** best adaptation of an unadaptable book.

**00:08:58** But when I've heard that Amazon was spending

**00:09:01** a hundred billion dollars to adapt some,

**00:09:05** but not all of the Cimarillion is like,

**00:09:08** boy, you've lost before you started.

**00:09:11** I don't need to know any more information then.

**00:09:14** Oh, we're going to make a TV show out of the Cimarillion.

**00:09:16** Okay.

**00:09:17** I hope you don't spend a lot of money on it.

**00:09:19** Oh.

**00:09:20** In all seriousness is,

**00:09:21** I don't know if you know the number,

**00:09:22** but they paid $250 million for the rights.

**00:09:27** Oh my God.

**00:09:27** And then $465 million for the first season

**00:09:31** is what it cost to make.

**00:09:32** So they're up to $715 million spent so far.

**00:09:36** Okay.

**00:09:37** Again, I haven't been following it.

**00:09:38** It's impossible to spend,

**00:09:40** like there's no,

**00:09:41** surely there is no expectation

**00:09:44** of any return on that money, right?

**00:09:46** I don't know.

**00:09:48** I just think,

**00:09:50** look, my opinion with any of this kind of stuff is,

**00:09:53** hey, you want to make a great movie?

**00:09:55** You want to make a great TV show?

**00:09:58** You know what the most important part of this is?

**00:10:00** The writing of it.

**00:10:01** That's the critical thing is,

**00:10:04** spend some time on the scripts

**00:10:07** and Lord of the Rings falls into the same category

**00:10:10** as my head as when Apple announced

**00:10:13** they were going to also spend $100 billion on foundation.

**00:10:16** And as soon as I heard that it was the same thing of like,

**00:10:20** oh, you've lost before you've begun.

**00:10:21** You're going to try to adapt the foundation stories.

**00:10:25** Good luck with that.

**00:10:25** And then I watched one episode of that TV show

**00:10:28** and was like, yup, this totally failed.

**00:10:31** Yeah, I didn't see that one yet.

**00:10:32** You know, I've never seen the Lord of the Rings.

**00:10:35** Oh yeah?

**00:10:36** I don't know if I recommend it.

**00:10:37** I like it.

**00:10:38** I think you more than liked the Lord of the Rings.

**00:10:40** Oh yeah, no, no.

**00:10:41** I guess what I mean here is I'm just saying,

**00:10:43** I actually just had the same thing

**00:10:44** I just watched Dune quite recently

**00:10:46** and had the same sort of feeling of,

**00:10:48** oh, I really enjoyed that.

**00:10:49** I cannot experience it as a movie.

**00:10:52** I can only experience it as an adaptation.

**00:10:55** So it makes it impossible for me

**00:10:57** to give a general recommendation.

**00:11:01** And it's the same with Lord of the Rings.

**00:11:02** It's like, oh, I love those movies.

**00:11:04** Can I recommend them?

**00:11:04** I don't know.

**00:11:05** I just can't perceive them as anything other

**00:11:07** than an adaptation.

**00:11:08** And I just don't know how they work for someone unfamiliar

**00:11:12** with the source material.

**00:11:14** Anyway.

**00:11:16** Anyway.

**00:11:17** Yeah, anyway, I recommend people watch my Lord of the Rings

**00:11:20** videos rather than watching the Lord of the Rings Amazon show.

**00:11:23** What you're saying is Amazon should give you $715 million.

**00:11:27** Yes.

**00:11:28** I can promise them I will make one more video on one more.

**00:11:33** I think it would be a better investment.

**00:11:35** This episode of Cortex is brought to you by LinkedIn Jobs.

**00:11:39** It's a new year, but it might feel harder than ever

**00:11:41** to find and hire the qualified people that you need,

**00:11:44** especially for small businesses.

**00:11:46** And that's where LinkedIn Jobs comes in,

**00:11:48** because they make it easier to find the people you

**00:11:50** want to talk to faster and for free.

**00:11:53** You can create a free job post in minutes on LinkedIn Jobs

**00:11:56** to reach your network and beyond

**00:11:58** to the world's largest professional network

**00:12:01** of over 770 million people.

**00:12:04** You can focus on candidates with just the right skills

**00:12:06** and experience and use screening questions

**00:12:09** to get your role in front of only the most qualified.

**00:12:12** Then use the simple tools on LinkedIn Jobs

**00:12:15** to quickly filter and prioritize who you'd

**00:12:17** like to interview and hire.

**00:12:19** All of this stuff really puts me at ease.

**00:12:21** Hiring is a huge task.

**00:12:24** You are deciding to let somebody into your business.

**00:12:26** You want to make sure it's the right person.

**00:12:28** So you want to be able to get your job listing out

**00:12:31** to as many people as possible and also

**00:12:33** know before you even get to the interview stage,

**00:12:36** even, that they're going to pass some of the things

**00:12:38** that you need for the role that's in question.

**00:12:41** So being able to have those screening questions

**00:12:43** is something that's super, super important.

**00:12:45** And then the tools are great, because you can use them

**00:12:47** wherever you want, even on the goals.

**00:12:49** If you have tons of applicants, you

**00:12:50** can kind of chip through them whenever you've got five minutes

**00:12:53** online.

**00:12:54** These are just some of the reasons

**00:12:55** why small businesses rate LinkedIn Jobs number one

**00:12:58** in delivering quality hires versus leading competitors.

**00:13:02** LinkedIn Jobs helps you find the candidates

**00:13:04** that you want to talk to faster.

**00:13:11** Post your job for free at linkedin.com slash cortex.

**00:13:15** That's linkedin.com slash cortex to post your job for free.

**00:13:19** Times and conditions apply.

**00:13:20** I thank the LinkedIn Jobs for the support of this show

**00:13:23** and all of Relay FM.

**00:13:25** So yes, the last time I had a video that had the proper sidebar

**00:13:30** badge on it is six months ago.

**00:13:33** So yeah, it's been a while since the main one.

**00:13:36** But it's up.

**00:13:37** It's doing well.

**00:13:38** People seem to like it.

**00:13:38** It's doing really well.

**00:13:39** Yeah, you never know what kind of reaction

**00:13:41** you're going to get from these videos.

**00:13:43** It's always one of those things of like, oh, god,

**00:13:45** hold your breath.

**00:13:47** Upload it.

**00:13:47** See if people like it.

**00:13:48** But it's been pretty positively received.

**00:13:50** People seem happy in the comments.

**00:13:52** So yeah, it only took half a year.

**00:13:56** Well, it also took a great occasion too, right?

**00:13:58** Yeah, so behind the scenes for the production of this,

**00:14:01** I'd mentioned in the last few episodes

**00:14:03** how I felt really tapped out, particularly over the holidays.

**00:14:06** And I was just having a hard time kind of getting back

**00:14:10** into the actual flow of work.

**00:14:12** And so I did make the decision at the end of January.

**00:14:16** OK, it's time to play the winning card here of I'm

**00:14:20** going to go on a great occasion.

**00:14:21** In case of emergency, bright glass.

**00:14:23** Yeah, of course.

**00:14:25** Now my whole brain is just filled with magic metaphors.

**00:14:28** So I'm like, what would be the casting cost of great occasion?

**00:14:30** And what would that card do?

**00:14:31** Your tweets are absolutely nonsensical.

**00:14:36** Like every now and then, to me, it

**00:14:38** looks like you've been hacked now.

**00:14:40** Because you say this stuff?

**00:14:42** Let me get an example of this.

**00:14:44** Legendary artifact creature equipment jellyfish.

**00:14:47** Yeah.

**00:14:48** I saw you tweet this the other day.

**00:14:50** I was like, what the fuck?

**00:14:52** What is that?

**00:14:53** And then I looked in the replies.

**00:14:55** It was like, oh, it's magic.

**00:14:56** OK.

**00:14:57** So yeah, everything is like magic metaphors in my brain

**00:15:01** now.

**00:15:01** So I was like, oh yeah, play great occasion.

**00:15:03** What would that be?

**00:15:04** Like three blue and a white, take an extra turn,

**00:15:07** something like that?

**00:15:08** I don't know.

**00:15:08** Oh, yeah, I'm all right.

**00:15:09** Anyway, I'm not going to do this.

**00:15:11** I'll let people in the comments come up

**00:15:12** with what would great occasion be as a card.

**00:15:14** But yeah, this is always my just basically always works trick.

**00:15:19** And I felt like I'm just having too much of a hard time getting

**00:15:24** back into a good rhythm of work.

**00:15:25** I was just being too inconsistent about it

**00:15:27** and just very frustrated.

**00:15:29** And so yeah, I ended up taking a great occasion.

**00:15:32** It was a very funny one for me because I actually

**00:15:35** just stayed in London.

**00:15:37** It was the first time I've done this since back

**00:15:40** when I was a teacher.

**00:15:41** But yeah, I just picked a hotel in a different spot in the city

**00:15:46** and went there for 10, 12 days in the end.

**00:15:51** And yeah, this is my OK, you arrive.

**00:15:54** And the trick is to sort of show up

**00:15:57** with a particular mindset of this is serious time, brain.

**00:16:02** Look, you can see how serious we are because we're

**00:16:05** in a different location.

**00:16:06** We've gone through a minor pain in the butt of packing up

**00:16:11** and traveling and going to this spot.

**00:16:13** And now we're going to stay in this room.

**00:16:17** And I know you want to wander all over the place, brain.

**00:16:21** But that's not going to happen.

**00:16:23** We're just in this room.

**00:16:25** We've brought our nice keyboard.

**00:16:27** I've set up like a weird standing desk situation.

**00:16:30** And this is what we're going to do.

**00:16:32** We're just going to work on this stuff.

**00:16:34** And yeah, it's extreme.

**00:16:36** But I always find like these are just the absolute most productive

**00:16:39** times for me is when I really kind of seal off in this.

**00:16:42** And like this time, it's also really good to reboot

**00:16:47** and just get back into the proper habit of working.

**00:16:51** And with this video in particular,

**00:16:52** there was one problem that I was having, which was I have rarely

**00:16:57** had a video where getting the audio right was just so hard.

**00:17:03** And personally, this is my least favorite part

**00:17:06** of making all of the videos is recording the audio.

**00:17:09** It's the one time in the process where I feel a huge resistance.

**00:17:15** Like I just never want to record the final audio.

**00:17:18** Part of that is because it's like, well, now it's actually locked in.

**00:17:22** You can't make any changes.

**00:17:23** This is just the way the video is going to have to be.

**00:17:26** And part of it is I just hate it.

**00:17:29** And I find it really hard.

**00:17:31** But with this one, my final count was I did three recordings, each of which

**00:17:38** were three takes.

**00:17:40** So it took a total of nine takes before I got audio that I liked.

**00:17:45** And the final version that went up on the YouTube channel

**00:17:48** was a combination of the last three takes.

**00:17:51** On average, the number of takes I have to do for videos

**00:17:53** has slowly gone down over the years.

**00:17:56** But this was just like a sudden explosion in, oh, it's all wrong.

**00:17:59** And part of it is also in the process of making these videos.

**00:18:02** I do a rough audio first that we do rough animations

**00:18:06** to to try to just spot if there's any problems in the script.

**00:18:10** And even the rough audio, I was like, oh, God, I hate it.

**00:18:13** I hate it so much.

**00:18:14** It's just not working at all.

**00:18:15** Anyway, the trick that I figured out with this one was,

**00:18:18** so if you've watched a bunch of my videos, you'll know that there is a wide range

**00:18:24** of the speed of how fast I talk.

**00:18:27** And my general rule here is that if I'm talking very fast,

**00:18:31** it's because the viewer doesn't need to follow the details.

**00:18:35** I'm just trying to give an overview of, oh, look, this stuff is really complicated.

**00:18:39** You don't need to know all the details.

**00:18:41** It's fine.

**00:18:42** We're just going to quickly blast through it.

**00:18:44** And that's what talking fast is to the listener.

**00:18:47** It's like an indication of you're not supposed to remember all these details.

**00:18:50** What I realized afterwards with the problem was is I thought that this video

**00:18:56** was a fast talking video.

**00:18:58** And it's partly because I thought this isn't actually like a huge topic.

**00:19:02** This is fairly constrained as topics go.

**00:19:05** So when I would record the audio and it was long, I'd go, oh, I shouldn't have this 10-minute

**00:19:11** audio thing here.

**00:19:12** I should talk way faster.

**00:19:13** Like this should be a six-minute video.

**00:19:15** And so I would, basically the first takes that I did, the first six, were all too fast.

**00:19:21** And I realized afterwards, no, it does need to be slow because even though this is a video

**00:19:26** which is sort of talking about the system is complicated,

**00:19:30** I think I didn't realize for a bit, oh, the first 80% of this, I really do want the listener

**00:19:36** to follow all the details.

**00:19:37** Like, yes, there's a lot of stuff, but I was just going through it too fast.

**00:19:42** So I ended up slowing down my narration by about 30% for the last few takes.

**00:19:47** Oh, okay.

**00:19:48** This is way better.

**00:19:49** Like, I don't know why I had it in my head that this should have been a much shorter

**00:19:53** video and should have been a much faster video.

**00:19:54** This one, the viewer actually can follow what's happening in the first 80%.

**00:19:59** That ate up a bunch of my great-cation time was just forcing myself to do the recordings

**00:20:06** and then also edit them together, which is really time-consuming, and then have to make

**00:20:12** the decision at the end of each sort of two-day period of like, oh, I just don't think this

**00:20:18** audio is good enough, and then do it again and then do it again before I finally got the

**00:20:24** final audio.

**00:20:24** So yeah, sometimes you just really need to force yourself into a situation where you're

**00:20:28** going to do the work, and this was definitely necessary this time.

**00:20:31** There's a lot of information in this one.

**00:20:33** Yeah, that's why like the fast talking just didn't work as much, and I just don't know

**00:20:38** why I thought that it would, but I'm very glad I slowed it down, and I think it's been

**00:20:42** well-received partly because of that.

**00:20:44** I think it would not have been nearly as well-liked if I was blasting through at my original pace.

**00:20:48** Do you remember if the version you sent me, was that the final audio, or did you give

**00:20:52** it another go after that?

**00:20:53** I think I sent you the version with the audio as it currently is.

**00:20:56** I'm fairly certain about that.

**00:20:58** I think it didn't have music, but I can't remember.

**00:21:00** It had music.

**00:21:01** It was too loud.

**00:21:02** That was my...

**00:21:03** Oh, right.

**00:21:04** That's right.

**00:21:05** You didn't like the music.

**00:21:06** You thought the music was too loud, yes.

**00:21:07** For me, anyway.

**00:21:08** Maybe I don't remember, because I found that it was hard for me to keep track of what was

**00:21:11** going on, because it's a lot of information.

**00:21:14** And also, I mean, I don't know how this, if this video plays differently, like, I don't

**00:21:19** know the basics of any of this.

**00:21:21** Like, I'm not American.

**00:21:22** Like, I don't have any institutional knowledge about the interstate highway system.

**00:21:28** I do wonder if this video plays differently in different places, maybe more than some

**00:21:32** others.

**00:21:33** Do you care intrinsically more about this if you're American?

**00:21:36** Probably.

**00:21:37** Well, so you've actually hit on something in the production process of this.

**00:21:40** But I'm kind of curious, I should have asked you at the time, how did this play to you

**00:21:44** as someone who is just totally unfamiliar with this?

**00:21:49** And until recently has never even driven, right?

**00:21:52** Do you have a driver's license yet?

**00:21:54** You still don't, right?

**00:21:55** No.

**00:21:56** Okay, here we go.

**00:21:57** To me, it was kind of like, I will say this one washed over me a little bit, where I was

**00:22:02** like, okay, I thought it was pretty and I was entertained, but I didn't care about it.

**00:22:08** Yeah, that makes total sense.

**00:22:09** And I can imagine that I maybe have a similar view, but I bet that you have a lot of listeners

**00:22:15** in America who really care.

**00:22:18** This one seems like one of those videos where there's two types of people, people that really

**00:22:23** care and people that don't care, because it's just like this information is not interesting

**00:22:28** to me to keep in the long run.

**00:22:30** But it was intriguing.

**00:22:32** My favorite part about it was just you going through all of the parts where it didn't make

**00:22:36** sense.

**00:22:37** That's what I liked.

**00:22:38** Now, that stuff is always fun.

**00:22:39** Just looking through the data and so about half of the views come from the United States.

**00:22:45** Is that any different to other videos?

**00:22:47** It's higher, but it's not a lot.

**00:22:49** I'm just quickly glancing around.

**00:22:50** It looks like 40% of the videos are normally from the United States, so it's higher, but

**00:22:55** it's not crazy higher.

**00:22:57** But I've given up guessing with the statistics on YouTube videos of what our video is going

**00:23:01** to be like.

**00:23:02** It doesn't mean anything.

**00:23:03** You know what I mean?

**00:23:04** It doesn't mean anything.

**00:23:05** Okay, we have that information.

**00:23:06** We can draw a conclusion from it, but really?

**00:23:08** It doesn't mean anything.

**00:23:09** Yeah, some of them are very funny.

**00:23:11** Your being someone who's not familiar with the interstates is part of what kind of came

**00:23:16** up in the process of making this video.

**00:23:18** So, part of the difficulty of making these kinds of things is, as always, when the final

**00:23:24** video goes up, it always looks really simple.

**00:23:28** And that's what's supposed to be the case.

**00:23:31** You as the viewer are supposed to watch a video, and I feel like I succeed if the impression

**00:23:36** that people have is a little bit like, oh, that was straightforward and simple and sort

**00:23:43** of feeling like it shouldn't have taken him much time to put together that video at all.

**00:23:48** Like I understand why people have that feeling, because that's what the final presentation

**00:23:53** should be.

**00:23:54** Here's a bunch of information.

**00:23:56** It's all in a nice order.

**00:23:58** So like it goes down nice and smooth, and it wraps up exactly when it's supposed to

**00:24:02** be.

**00:24:03** But as always, before the video was written, when you're just looking at a blank page and

**00:24:08** you're trying to write a script about something, it is not remotely clear at all what even

**00:24:13** is the video.

**00:24:14** And so part of what took a really long time with this one is exactly this question that

**00:24:21** sort of you're hitting on is, I didn't actually describe at any point, yeah, but what are

**00:24:30** the interstate highways?

**00:24:32** Why are they different?

**00:24:33** Why are they a thing of any interest whatsoever?

**00:24:36** Like it's just a bunch of roads.

**00:24:39** And in my earlier versions of the script, there was a ton of stuff which was setting

**00:24:44** up, yeah, but what are the interstates?

**00:24:47** Why are they different?

**00:24:48** Why are they worth talking about in the first place?

**00:24:51** So why would this numbering system even be something that anybody cares about?

**00:24:55** But as the script went on and on and I kept doing more and more revisions, I kind of cut

**00:25:01** down that further and further and further and further until at some point I made a decision

**00:25:08** which was, okay, you know what?

**00:25:10** This is a video for people who already know what the interstates are.

**00:25:16** They're already familiar with them.

**00:25:17** I don't think that if you explained it all to me that I would necessarily have cared

**00:25:22** any more about the interstate highway system.

**00:25:25** See, I disagree.

**00:25:26** I think I could have made you care more if I had put more of that stuff in.

**00:25:31** But like I enjoyed, I liked the visuals of this one and I liked the weirdness part of

**00:25:35** it.

**00:25:36** It's just think if you were to spend all that time explaining to me the history of

**00:25:39** the interstate system, I don't...

**00:25:42** It's like two things and I don't think that the second part would have necessarily been

**00:25:47** enhanced by the first part for me.

**00:25:49** This is why it ended up getting split is because I thought, you know what?

**00:25:54** This just doesn't work in here.

**00:25:57** This is the problem when you make stuff.

**00:25:59** You find all of this information that you love or like little facts that you go, oh,

**00:26:03** that's totally delightful.

**00:26:05** There's one piece of information I was just desperately trying to work in anywhere in

**00:26:11** the script and it was just completely impossible.

**00:26:13** If you've ever written something, this is something over the years that I try to keep

**00:26:17** in mind is like, that's a warning sign.

**00:26:20** If there's a piece of information that you keep going like, where can I put this in?

**00:26:25** The answer is don't put this in.

**00:26:29** You personally like it too much and it doesn't actually belong in this thing.

**00:26:34** It should be easier to put it in if it actually belongs here.

**00:26:39** The little fact is that the interstate highway system was partly built for the American military.

**00:26:45** A lot of the specifications about how these roads have to be relates to what the military

**00:26:53** wanted.

**00:26:55** One of the things that was in the original specification in...

**00:26:58** I'm just doing this off the top of my head so the dates might not be exactly right, but

**00:27:01** like the 1950s...

**00:27:02** No one fact checks to show your family.

**00:27:04** Listen, Mike, people love to fact check everything that I do.

**00:27:09** I've got this whole world of people who like to catch errors and I totally get it.

**00:27:14** The original specifications for the highway was all of the bridges that go over the interstate

**00:27:22** have to have 14 feet of vertical clearance.

**00:27:27** The way they came up with 14 feet was that was the height necessary to move the, at the

**00:27:33** time, intercontinental nuclear ballistic missiles around.

**00:27:38** We need to drive these nuclear missiles around.

**00:27:40** We need 14 feet of vertical clearance on all of the bridges.

**00:27:43** You don't want to bump a nuke, do you?

**00:27:45** You don't want to bump a nuke.

**00:27:47** That's exactly right.

**00:27:50** The Department of Transportation gave all the funding to these local states and the project

**00:27:54** was hugely under development.

**00:27:56** And then at some point in like 1968, the military came back and said, hey, we've made

**00:28:03** our nukes way bigger.

**00:28:05** We need 17 feet of clearance now on all of the bridges.

**00:28:10** And to this day, the United States is still retrofitting a bunch of the bridges that they

**00:28:17** built at 14 feet to make them 17 feet to fit the nukes.

**00:28:22** It is this enormous project of, oh, we built a ton of bridges for 14 feet of vertical clearance

**00:28:28** and now we need to make them 17 feet for the bigger nukes that the military wants to move

**00:28:33** around.

**00:28:34** I love that piece of information.

**00:28:36** And I was like, I desperately want to fit this in because it's just funny.

**00:28:40** You can also kind of imagine it visually as like the stick figure girls arguing with each

**00:28:45** other about like, but my nukes are bigger.

**00:28:46** Like you need to make your bridges bigger.

**00:28:48** I had a bunch of stuff about that, about like, what is the interstate really?

**00:28:53** Like what is this connected to?

**00:28:55** But it all just slowly got cut over time.

**00:28:58** But that nuke one, I was like, I was holding on to that one at the bitter end.

**00:29:01** I was like, there's got to be a way I could squeeze this in.

**00:29:04** But the answer is no, don't do that.

**00:29:06** Instead just accept that for some videos, it makes sense to not actually explain the

**00:29:12** whole thing.

**00:29:13** There are just times when you have to recognize, okay, just make the thing for people who already

**00:29:17** know about the thing.

**00:29:19** I have tried for years as a style guide to work with videos like assume that the viewer

**00:29:25** is an intelligent person who just for whatever reason has happened to never come across this

**00:29:32** topic before.

**00:29:33** And so like when I'm writing scripts, I really do try most of the time to think assume that

**00:29:39** the person doesn't know anything at all about this and explain it from the start.

**00:29:43** With this one, I think it made sense as I kept drafting the script to get rid of all

**00:29:48** of this other stuff about the interstate and just be like, you know what?

**00:29:52** Not every video really can be for everyone.

**00:29:54** This works better as a video for people who are already familiar with this, which would

**00:29:59** be basically everyone in America where driving on the interstates is already a big deal part

**00:30:05** of your life.

**00:30:07** Everyone knows these roads.

**00:30:09** There's basically nowhere in America where you aren't constantly hyper aware of when

**00:30:14** you are on or are not on the interstate.

**00:30:18** And it's just like you can just assume that this is knowledge all Americans have about

**00:30:24** the interstates and just run with it.

**00:30:25** Be like, hey, there's a thing about this thing that you probably never knew, which is that

**00:30:29** the numbers mean something.

**00:30:30** And then just purely focus on that part.

**00:30:33** And again, I know that all of this stuff sounds really obvious in retrospect once you

**00:30:39** have seen the video, but it's hard to explain how it is not obvious at the start.

**00:30:45** What part is the part that just makes sense to focus on?

**00:30:49** This episode of Cortex is brought to you by our very good friends at Memberful.

**00:30:53** The easiest way to sell memberships to your audience.

**00:30:57** Memberful is used by the biggest creators on the web to generate sustainable recurring

**00:31:01** income while diversifying revenue streams.

**00:31:04** You may have heard us talk about the Relay FM membership program and Moretex before here

**00:31:09** on this show.

**00:31:10** Memberful is the platform that we use to power this whole initiative because they make it

**00:31:15** so incredibly easy to generate the extra revenue stream while also delivering bonus content

**00:31:21** to our Moretexans.

**00:31:23** Maybe you're already producing content yourself.

**00:31:25** Maybe you're relying on advertising, some other income or no income at all.

**00:31:30** Memberful makes it easy to diversify this with everything that you need to run a membership

**00:31:33** program of your own.

**00:31:35** They give you the ability to custom brand your membership program, use gift subscriptions,

**00:31:39** Apple Pay, free trials, private podcasts and tons more while leaving you with full control

**00:31:44** and ownership of everything that relates to your audience, brand and your membership.

**00:31:49** One of the things that we absolutely love here at Relay FM is those private podcast

**00:31:53** feeds.

**00:31:54** So when somebody signs up for some of our membership content like Moretex, they get

**00:31:58** the ability to have a feed of their very own that they put into their podcast player.

**00:32:03** And if they decide they want to cancel their subscription, they stop getting those new

**00:32:06** episodes.

**00:32:07** So we don't have to do any of the maintenance for that.

**00:32:09** It's the same as with the Relay FM members Discord.

**00:32:11** It's powered by an integration with Memberful.

**00:32:14** When people sign up, they get a link to sign into the Discord.

**00:32:16** If they stop being a member, then they're removed from it.

**00:32:19** It's really easy.

**00:32:20** We don't have to do any of it.

**00:32:21** And it makes it easy for us to be able to add in tons of these fantastic benefits for

**00:32:26** our members without having to add loads of overhead into our business.

**00:32:30** You can even now send paid email newsletters directly through Memberful without needing

**00:32:35** to connect to a third party email provider.

**00:32:37** You can publish your paid newsletter content to a Memberful hosted members only website

**00:32:41** so people can repost issues.

**00:32:43** And there's no additional fee when signed up for Memberful's pro or premium plans.

**00:33:09** I know that this information exists in a really clear way, I assume, for you to take it, you

**00:33:17** know, and make a script out of.

**00:33:19** But I would imagine that the fact checking for this one would be hard because I feel

**00:33:25** like this is one where there's lots of little details that people living in those places

**00:33:31** know.

**00:33:33** And you have to get it right to be happy.

**00:33:36** Was it difficult to get this one like nailed down?

**00:33:39** Let me back up just one moment there, because if you think about this topic, yeah, you are

**00:33:45** right.

**00:33:46** Like you can go on the Wikipedia page about the interstate highway system.

**00:33:49** And then there is just a section which explains the numbering system like that's relatively

**00:33:53** straightforward.

**00:33:54** I mean, and there's maps to what else I'm thinking, right?

**00:33:57** Like for you to actually get the routes and where they start and end, right?

**00:34:00** You just look at maps.

**00:34:01** Yeah, that exists.

**00:34:03** I think part of what I was talking about before of the how do you make this go down easy?

**00:34:09** Like how do you make a video that is easily understandable is when you're reading something

**00:34:15** about this numbering system, you have the advantage of it's much easier to jump back

**00:34:21** and jump ahead if you don't understand something.

**00:34:23** So you can go like, okay, you read this part and you go ahead and then you realize, oh,

**00:34:27** I needed something from before and then read that bit again.

**00:34:30** Like when you read something, you're reading it less linearly than you think you're reading

**00:34:35** it.

**00:34:36** And so if you want to make a video that is interesting and also understandable, you can't

**00:34:41** just take, oh, here's the Wikipedia summary and basically read it.

**00:34:46** Like, I just don't think that makes for a really interesting video.

**00:34:49** And you have to figure out what order am I explaining this, presuming that someone can't

**00:34:55** go backwards.

**00:34:56** And that's why in this video, it took me a while to break it down into making up these

**00:35:01** three categories of interstates like, oh, there's majors and there's mediums and there's

**00:35:05** minors, which don't really exist as official designations or anything.

**00:35:11** Like that's not really a thing.

**00:35:12** It's like a category I came up with because I was thinking about constellations and like

**00:35:16** Ursa Major and Ursa Minor.

**00:35:17** And it's like, okay, great, I'm going to go with that.

**00:35:19** Right?

**00:35:20** Because we have like this constellation theme, but that's where it's actually harder to do

**00:35:25** it in video form than you think of like, what is the order in which you can kind of present

**00:35:30** this to people so that each thing hopefully builds on the last thing?

**00:35:36** That's why you start with like, here's the big broad ones going East to West, right?

**00:35:40** Which just even visually is the most clearest.

**00:35:42** Like these roads are going across and then you have these roads going up and down.

**00:35:47** And then you like, you jump over to the minors, which then makes sense to say, okay, these

**00:35:52** are the little bits that break off.

**00:35:54** And then you can kind of go back to the mediums as like, these are the ones that are in the

**00:35:58** middle, but even creating these categories helps a listener know we've moved on to a

**00:36:06** different kind of thing.

**00:36:08** Like it's a little signal like that part is over.

**00:36:12** Here's the next part.

**00:36:13** Hopefully this part builds on it.

**00:36:14** So like, like that's part of the, that's part of the trick of it.

**00:36:18** And I think also having, it's not really necessary, but even just having some kind of additional

**00:36:26** metaphor like, oh, it's, it's navigations, it's constellations.

**00:36:31** I think that does help give your brain something else to hold on to, to like pin this explanation

**00:36:37** to as, as it exists.

**00:36:39** So yeah, like there's, there's some tricks that might not be obvious when you're just

**00:36:42** watching the video and, and hopefully it feels like, Oh, that was great.

**00:36:45** And that was simple.

**00:36:46** And that was straightforward.

**00:36:47** And then when you go and read the Wikipedia page, you feel like, Oh, okay, this, this

**00:36:50** makes total sense, but you've also now heard it once before.

**00:36:53** But yeah, fact checking this kind of thing is ever since the T-Coy incident, like it definitely

**00:36:59** tuned up the fact checking for sure.

**00:37:02** That stuff always gets through like, when I think about the sort of mistakes that get

**00:37:08** through in the videos, I do have a bunch of levels.

**00:37:11** Like I talked about this in the CGP Grey was wrong video about like, Oh, there's sort of

**00:37:16** different ways to categorize what kind of mistakes can there be.

**00:37:20** But even within those categories, I sort of subdivide things.

**00:37:24** So there are a few things in this video, which I would regard as blunders that made it through,

**00:37:30** but they're all in a level where it's like, I think it's fine.

**00:37:32** There's typos, typos to me are the kind of blunders where it's so small.

**00:37:38** I just, I'm not wildly concerned.

**00:37:41** It's like I spell San Francisco wrong at one point in the video.

**00:37:44** It's like, that's fine.

**00:37:45** I can live with San Francisco having two Cs in it.

**00:37:49** Wait, but it has to, no, I see what you did.

**00:37:52** I see.

**00:37:53** No, I, I then put two Cs in my head.

**00:37:55** Did you put a C after the N?

**00:37:57** Is that what you did?

**00:37:58** No S it's like, it's just two Cs.

**00:38:01** San Francisco.

**00:38:02** Yeah, San Francisco.

**00:38:03** I like that.

**00:38:04** Yeah.

**00:38:05** That's also one of those cases where by the time the video was actually published, something

**00:38:09** like a dozen people had seen the video and exactly zero people had spotted that San

**00:38:15** Francisco was typed wrong, including me and everyone working on the video and everyone

**00:38:19** else I showed it to.

**00:38:20** So it's like, that's fine.

**00:38:22** I can live with that.

**00:38:23** The ones that are, that are not so obvious for people is pronunciation errors.

**00:38:29** There's a couple of places where I just pronounced the name wrong.

**00:38:32** And this is one that is always frustrating because it's also one of these cases where

**00:38:38** it is, if you're not from the place, it can be surprisingly hard to try to find what is

**00:38:45** the correct local pronunciation of this town name.

**00:38:48** I was going on YouTube for some of them trying to find like local news broadcasts from the

**00:38:53** town to be like, how are they saying the name?

**00:38:55** But you can end up getting like a bunch of different ones.

**00:38:58** And then there's just the actual problem of the performance of it where when you say it,

**00:39:04** when you're recording it, you can still just mess it up sometimes and get it wrong.

**00:39:08** So I think the worst one in there is I say Penumbra, North Dakota.

**00:39:13** I looked at that.

**00:39:14** I cannot tell you how many times with listening to the pronunciation guides.

**00:39:19** I know that there is no R sound in that town name.

**00:39:23** It didn't stop me that every time I said it in all of the recordings, like I said it wrong

**00:39:28** in a slightly different way.

**00:39:30** And I had to just go with, well, I'm going to take the take.

**00:39:33** That's the least wrong take.

**00:39:34** It's like, I'm sorry.

**00:39:36** Pem, God, I can't even do it now.

**00:39:39** Like Pemba North Dakota.

**00:39:40** I'm very sorry that I got you wrong.

**00:39:43** I tried.

**00:39:44** I swear I tried, but it just ended up with an R that doesn't exist there.

**00:39:48** You're always going to run up against this kind of local knowledge.

**00:39:52** And yeah, it's extremely hard being on the other side of the world to try to like nail

**00:39:57** all of that stuff down.

**00:39:59** I don't think it makes any difference that you're here rather than there for it being

**00:40:03** easier.

**00:40:04** I guess what I mean is it would be easier if I lived in the town, right?

**00:40:07** Then I.

**00:40:08** Yeah.

**00:40:09** Oh, okay.

**00:40:10** Yes.

**00:40:11** But that's kind of my point of why I thought this one might be tricky is that there is

**00:40:14** that exact thing of there are lots of people that are intimately familiar with the places

**00:40:20** and the routes that you're talking about.

**00:40:22** Like for example, I'm very sure that some of the weird roads that you've mentioned,

**00:40:27** if you actually drive them, oh, like you say it ends here, but actually there's like a

**00:40:31** little way, you know, like if you're from that area, like, Oh no, it's not as simple

**00:40:34** as this is also like, what stuff do you include in the video and what stuff do you don't include

**00:40:38** in the video?

**00:40:39** And there's a lot of things that were not included.

**00:40:41** And one of them is that a lot of places are dual signed.

**00:40:47** So a road will be, Oh, this is actually two interstates at the same time.

**00:40:51** And then you can, you can also run into some weird situations where a route is dual signed

**00:40:57** in the sense that this is both of the interstates, but they only have one sign for which interstate

**00:41:04** it is there.

**00:41:05** You can run into an opposite problem where like I've seen some people leave comments

**00:41:09** for like local areas where they go like, Oh, uh, you said this road is interstate whatever,

**00:41:14** but it isn't.

**00:41:15** It's actually like us route this, I am aware of that, but it is because there isn't a sign

**00:41:21** saying that that is interstate whatever, but looked it up as like, yes, but the state receives

**00:41:27** federal funds.

**00:41:28** So this is where people think you're wrong.

**00:41:32** Yeah.

**00:41:33** So actually, this is the case for, there's a section where I talk about the interstate

**00:41:39** interstates in Maryland and it's like, I knew this was going to happen, but I just

**00:41:42** wasn't going to explain it in the video of saying, Oh, Maryland has all of these interstates,

**00:41:46** but people in Maryland going like, I don't know what you're talking about.

**00:41:49** Like this interstate isn't there.

**00:41:50** Yeah.

**00:41:51** It's because it is a federal interstate, but it is not locally labeled as such.

**00:41:56** But I just, I like, I just cannot possibly get into this at this point in time and discuss

**00:42:01** all of these things.

**00:42:02** The other one that has come up sometimes is I've seen a few people message me about getting

**00:42:07** the state highways wrong.

**00:42:09** In the beginning I mentioned like, Oh, there's us roots 50 and 60.

**00:42:13** And several people have messaged me like, ha ha, like you got the states backward.

**00:42:17** No, they're in the right order.

**00:42:19** The us roots go in the opposite direction.

**00:42:22** They're numbered top to bottom instead of bottom to top.

**00:42:24** I just didn't discuss it in the video, which I do in retrospect think like, I probably

**00:42:28** should have mentioned that.

**00:42:29** But there's again, there's just so many things like what can you possibly mention?

**00:42:33** That stuff is fine.

**00:42:34** I don't mind that, but it is funny where you get people who will correct you about

**00:42:38** something and you're like, no, actually it is the opposite way, but I totally understand

**00:42:42** why it superficially looks wrong.

**00:42:44** But then there's just totally frustrating stuff where you do get something wrong.

**00:42:48** Like I have an error in the video, which I think is the worst one, but it's also completely

**00:42:53** understandable when you hear this, which is that I show the route I 76, which ends in

**00:43:00** I say Belmar, New Jersey.

**00:43:03** And so on the map, it shows like, oh, here's I 76 and where it goes in Belmar, New Jersey.

**00:43:09** But it turns out there's two towns called Belmar and Bell Mar in New Jersey.

**00:43:19** Wait, so it wants to spell the difference to me because that sounded the same.

**00:43:23** One of the towns is Belmar.

**00:43:25** The other town is Belmar.

**00:43:30** Right.

**00:43:31** Come on New Jersey.

**00:43:34** What are you doing?

**00:43:37** What is that?

**00:43:38** Right.

**00:43:39** So that's one of these things where it's like, yeah, I totally that that is a mistake, but

**00:43:44** that is also one of these cases where it is very understandable that both me and the animator

**00:43:52** who drew the map and the two official fact checkers I have checking everything they possibly

**00:43:58** can in the script.

**00:43:59** All of us missed that, but I feel like that's on New Jersey.

**00:44:02** I'm sorry.

**00:44:03** You shouldn't be irresponsible for your decisions.

**00:44:08** But nonetheless, every time I see that in the future, I'm going to be annoyed of like,

**00:44:13** oh, God damn it.

**00:44:14** It's the wrong Belmar.

**00:44:16** It should have been Belmoire or I don't even know how to say the second one, but they're

**00:44:20** on different sides of the state, which is why local people notice immediately.

**00:44:23** They're like, oh yeah, I-76 doesn't go all the way across New Jersey.

**00:44:27** It only goes to the west side in Belmoire.

**00:44:30** I guess that's what the W is for.

**00:44:31** It's west for Belmar West, New Jersey and Belmar without the W is East New Jersey.

**00:44:37** I do have to say on the opposite side, what's really fun is when people can add local information

**00:44:43** that there is just no way I could have ever possibly found out.

**00:44:47** In the video, I make a quick reference to the interstate highway splits for I-35, where

**00:44:55** it's this one exception where they have east and west branches and no other interstate

**00:44:59** does this east-west numbering.

**00:45:02** I could not for the life of me figure out what the reason was.

**00:45:06** I just kind of guess and say it in the video like, oh, this feels like one of these political

**00:45:10** situations where there's two rival cities right next to each other.

**00:45:16** Neither one wants to be the one that's on the bypass.

**00:45:19** This 100% feels like a political decision of going, fine, we're just going to do it

**00:45:25** east and west.

**00:45:26** Neither of you is the bypass, except I've gotten information from people who live in

**00:45:31** the towns about how they really know which one is the bypass because the mile markers

**00:45:39** continue being numbered in the correct way on one side, on either the east side or the

**00:45:44** west side.

**00:45:46** And the mile number markers start over on the opposite side.

**00:45:51** Aha, if you're a local, you totally know which one is the bypassed city and which one is

**00:45:58** the real city.

**00:45:59** So, I really love that, like when people can add information that's like, if I had spent

**00:46:05** a thousand years researching this script, I would never have come across that piece

**00:46:12** of information, but someone living locally can make it more fun.

**00:48:07** As the years have gone on, there is just a crazy amount of pressure that is very hard

**00:48:12** to explain of you're going to make a video on a topic.

**00:48:19** You're not an expert in that topic, but also you know, almost every expert in the world

**00:48:26** will end up watching this video along with potentially a couple of million other people

**00:48:33** who will also have random information they can add to the topic.

**00:48:37** I just cannot explain what the pressure of that feels like.

**00:48:40** Yeah, it seems horrible.

**00:48:41** It is something that over the years has definitely increased and did a big step function increase

**00:48:48** after the T-Coi incident.

**00:48:49** Well, yeah, I mean, this is that thing that I think we've spoken about a lot since then,

**00:48:54** which is it's not necessarily my challenge to you, but it is a point that I bring up.

**00:48:57** It's just like you have made it worse for yourself.

**00:49:01** Oh, yeah.

**00:49:02** In that you refuse to be comfortable with even the smallest errors, because I mean,

**00:49:10** going back to T-Coi, again, it's like you consider that error to have been massive.

**00:49:18** But 99.999999% of the world would not like it wasn't really that important for that video

**00:49:25** that you said that this place had a different type of rocket than what it actually had.

**00:49:31** So then it's like, as well as the world putting its pressure on you, you put pressure on yourself,

**00:49:39** which then makes the world put more pressure on you.

**00:49:43** And it just continues from there to like be correct.

**00:49:47** I don't think I would be any different if I was in your shoes, because at the point where you are

**00:49:54** with the type of stuff that you make videos about, you are right that like you have to become an expert in everything.

**00:50:03** And that seems horrible.

**00:50:10** Yeah, it's a bit different.

**00:50:12** Like it's not that I'm an expert, right?

**00:50:15** But I play one on YouTube.

**00:50:17** Yeah, OK, yeah, there is some truth to that.

**00:50:19** Yeah, I'm not an expert, but I play one on YouTube is not wrong.

**00:50:22** For those 10 minutes, do you have to beat that?

**00:50:25** Yeah, I think I would rephrase it like, oh, I need to become temporarily one of the best informed laymen on this topic.

**00:50:34** And again, not so much with this video, but with other stuff I've worked on and stuff that I am working on.

**00:50:40** There is also this problem which I think is really not obvious to people about experts in the field disagree.

**00:50:49** And so one of the skills you have to learn, which is very weird and also very demoralizing about the whole world,

**00:50:57** is you have to become good at picking which expert do you think is the reasonable expert in a field where you are not an expert,

**00:51:06** which can be kind of crazy making sometimes when people disagree with each other.

**00:51:10** That's common sense, right?

**00:51:12** I guess is what you're talking about here, though.

**00:51:15** You're using your gut. How else would you do it?

**00:51:17** Yeah, I think using your gut is too simple.

**00:51:19** I think I have some like basic heuristics that are helpful in this, but they're a little bit difficult to articulate.

**00:51:25** I don't think you could even if you tried.

**00:51:27** The best I can do just off the top of my head is I'm looking for experts who are consistent across other domains as well.

**00:51:40** You're looking for the expert who also doesn't seem to contradict any of the areas that they're butting up against.

**00:51:50** Now, of course, that's a recursion problem.

**00:51:52** How do you know those other areas that they're butting up against are correct, right?

**00:51:57** I'm very aware that's like a system that is extremely sensitive to the initial state of what are you assuming is correct and not correct.

**00:52:06** It's like so I read a couple of books about the interstate system in preparation for this video, which again, you don't know where you're going to find interesting stuff ahead of time.

**00:52:14** You can only know by reading through the books.

**00:52:16** And it can just be a red flag where someone will mention something about the interstate and you go like,

**00:52:22** that just doesn't seem to fit with other things that I think are true.

**00:52:26** And then you sort of dig into this and you go, oh, OK, it's like more complicated than was portrayed in this book.

**00:52:33** That's weird, though, right?

**00:52:35** Do you see the weirdness in that that you're coming along and making a piece of content about a certain subject area that will probably become the most consumed thing about that subject area?

**00:52:48** And there are people that are either considered to be or consider themselves to be experts, but then you have to judge them.

**00:52:56** Oh, yeah. But this is what I mean by like the totally crazy pressure of this.

**00:53:01** As we're laying this out, oh boy, that sounds horrible. That sounds horrible.

**00:53:05** Why do you do this? You should just make the outside ones. Forget all this nonsense.

**00:53:11** Yes. So like this is this is one of the reasons why, you know, the past few episodes we've been talking about, like thinking about future production and thinking about a bunch of stuff.

**00:53:18** And one of the things that I was going through and my feeling tapped out about video production was it's like at this point in my writing career as well, like I just have I have a ton of video topics to choose from.

**00:53:32** Lots of which are 20 percent to 40 percent complete because I've done like some initial research and it seems interesting.

**00:53:38** But the problem is there are there are so many things that seem interesting and simple until you ask three questions in a row about that topic and then you go, oh, this is not as it seems.

**00:53:54** And it can't be just like hugely dispiriting about the world in trying to think through, like, what do you think is true?

**00:54:04** And what do you think is true enough that you're willing to say it like a million people?

**00:54:09** I think back to when I first started doing this, it is laughable to me about how relatively carefree and breezy I was and just how even that old past gray felt like he was cautious about sources.

**00:54:26** And even that old past gray already knew like, oh, well, don't you know, don't use a newspaper as a source. That's worse than nothing.

**00:54:32** Current Gray looks at him and is like, oh, kid, you don't have any idea how bad this is going to get.

**00:54:38** Yeah, it's it's a very strange situation.

**00:54:40** And so it is one of these areas where lots of topics I feel like, boy, if I could lighten up on this, I could make lots of topics so much more easily than I currently can.

**00:54:53** But it's it's it's very hard to lighten up on this.

**00:54:57** And just when videos go out to a big audience, like it just it is a pressure that ends up really like building on itself over time.

**00:55:04** I mean, I can sympathize with this a little, like, so I kind of I understand what you're saying.

**00:55:08** There are things that I say or topics that I've covered where I've ended up thinking, oh, this is a good idea.

**00:55:16** And then it comes out that there's like people disagree with it or have like a difference of opinion.

**00:55:24** Or, you know, there are certain things I know that if I say them, I'm going to get a lot of pushback for it.

**00:55:30** But this is like just a thing that you learn over time.

**00:55:34** And it's kind of weird. It's like I kind of think of this as this is a very strange metaphor that I'm trying to build here.

**00:55:40** But OK, like a stone can be eroded over time. Right.

**00:55:46** So like we are the stones in this and the erosion is like feedback.

**00:55:52** And it can have two effects where it can either smooth you to it or it can make things more jagged.

**00:55:59** And so like this is where I'm saying that sometimes there's like a thing that I know if I want to talk about this,

**00:56:05** I'm going to get a lot of feedback on it. And like this is me accepting that.

**00:56:09** And over time, like that part is just smoothed out and I'm just all right, fine.

**00:56:13** I understand what's going to happen here.

**00:56:16** I'm just going to go for it.

**00:56:17** There is either going to be a lot of difference opinion or on the good side.

**00:56:20** A lot of people that are agree will agree with me, that kind of thing.

**00:56:23** But then there's like this other part of it where you don't even realize that something you're about to do,

**00:56:28** which is innocuous to you, is going to either be a wrong and you're going to hear about that a lot or B,

**00:56:36** you think this was just an opinion that lots of people have, but it turns out a lot of people disagree with you.

**00:56:42** And that's where it gets jagged.

**00:56:43** And it's kind of about trying to make that erosion over time completely smoothed out.

**00:56:48** And that can either be by accepting things or understanding them fully, correcting them, researching them over time.

**00:56:54** And so I have this on like a way smaller degree for a bunch of reasons.

**00:56:59** Like one, I don't purport to be an expert on anything.

**00:57:02** It's actually kind of my entire career is not being an expert in anything,

**00:57:06** but being interested in a bunch of things and talking to people who are more experts than me.

**00:57:11** So like that part doesn't really bother me if I don't understand it, whatever.

**00:57:15** Like I'm learning like everybody else.

**00:57:17** But also like just the scale of people that consume my content is so much smaller than yours.

**00:57:23** And then also I think the thing that is a benefit for me is the vast majority of people that are listening to my shows know me to some degree.

**00:57:32** Yes. Yeah.

**00:57:33** And let me off more because they know me.

**00:57:37** Right. They're like, I say a thing and it's wrong.

**00:57:40** And they're like, Mike, you got that wrong.

**00:57:41** But it's very rare like you idiot because they know me.

**00:57:45** Like, you know, they know that like, oh, I said this thing incorrectly or I made a mistake that it was a mistake.

**00:57:50** They're maybe like more willing to accept that.

**00:57:52** But you get so many people that watch your YouTube channel, they don't know you.

**00:57:57** And so it's like a whole different thing.

**00:58:00** Or like even if they watch all your videos, this type of content, like podcasts and stuff, people get much more of a sense of the person.

**00:58:07** And so I think can be kinder in that way.

**00:58:11** Well, like even just like people that have watched your videos for years, maybe still don't have that much of a sense of your personality as they would get through just listening to talk for an hour or two once a month.

**00:58:21** You know, yeah, for sure.

**00:58:22** So people, I think are maybe a bit more stupid.

**00:58:26** Like, why did you say this or like, you know, so my point is I feel like I can understand a little bit what you're talking about.

**00:58:32** But I can see how it's way, way harsher.

**00:58:35** And it's a thing I've talked to other creators about, like I think anyone who's in the educational field on YouTube, everyone experiences this to some extent or another, which is you get started in this because you're really just interested in a bunch of stuff and you want to talk about it.

**00:58:54** And like the problem is, as time goes on.

**00:59:00** In a way, I would love to start every video off with, hey, I've spent a lot of time researching this.

**00:59:07** This is the best version of this that I can do.

**00:59:10** But also, you know, like I'm not an expert in the interstate system.

**00:59:14** I'm not a transportation engineer.

**00:59:17** I am a person who just spends a lot of time on his own reading in a room.

**00:59:23** That's what I am.

**00:59:24** And like I try to turn this into an interesting thing for other people to watch.

**00:59:28** You can't do that in front of every video.

**00:59:30** It's horrifically boring.

**00:59:32** It just doesn't work.

**00:59:33** There's this phenomenon like I don't have a good word for this.

**00:59:37** People can put on you a level of expertise that you yourself are not claiming.

**00:59:45** And the only way to try to push back against that is to constantly remind people that you're not an expert in a way that I personally find just tedious and annoying and not worth doing.

**00:59:57** I mean, and it also devalues the work that you've done, too.

**01:00:01** Yeah, exactly.

**01:00:01** I think if anyone watches a bunch of educational YouTubers, you will see people do this.

**01:00:06** This is the reason why people will in their videos just be like, I'm just an idiot who doesn't know anything.

**01:00:12** Right. And they'll just say this and like, I hate it.

**01:00:15** I hate it when creators do that.

**01:00:18** But I also understand why creators are doing that because they're trying to push back both for the audience and I also think for themselves.

**01:00:26** The ever mounting pressure.

**01:00:29** I think it's vastly weighted towards the person or the audience.

**01:00:32** And it's not a criticism because I do it.

**01:00:35** But it's just like if you constantly get a certain type of feedback, like ultimately it changes you because you want to stop getting that feedback if you don't like it.

**01:00:44** And this is also in the inverse as well.

**01:00:46** If you keep getting feedback, which is good and you keep doing more of that, more people like it.

**01:00:52** This is like super, you know, good problem to have kind of problem, right?

**01:00:56** Yeah, of course. But it's still a tough thing to deal with when creating content, especially at the level that you're at. Right.

**01:01:03** Yeah. Yeah. I mean, look, I just did it.

**01:01:05** OK, so what I've just done, this is an example of the exact thing that I'm talking about where I feel like if I didn't say this, what I just said, people will go, oh, nice for you.

**01:01:18** Yeah, exactly. And that is what that is a reflex that I have where I feel like I have to say it because of the feedback that I would.

**01:01:26** Otherwise see of like, look at these guys complaining about how terrible their lives are when they have these dream jobs, which we know.

**01:01:36** Now, I would love to believe that inherently people understand that in the conversation.

**01:01:42** Most people do. I think the vast majority of people do.

**01:01:46** But it tends to be that there is a minority of people.

**01:01:50** It is the quote unquote vocal minority who will tell you and will complain to you about you.

**01:01:56** And over time, that is like the erosion where I feel like I can't have a conversation like this without giving that disclaimer.

**01:02:06** Yeah, there's nothing more frustrating than listening to someone who issues a disclaimer before every one of their sentences.

**01:02:12** Because I know that I just said that there are people like, all right, I get it.

**01:02:15** Or you don't have to you have to say this. I understand. I'm not an idiot. Right. I understand.

**01:02:20** Yeah. And you can you can hear people sometimes in the public arena get completely consumed by this disease where they issue a disclaimer in front of every sentence.

**01:02:28** And it makes them just interminable to listen to. And this is talking about like creating content that I know a younger me would be interested in us having this conversation on this podcast.

**01:02:39** I think for most listeners, the interesting part of this is hearing about the actual true behind the scenes.

**01:02:49** What is it like to be a person who makes these videos?

**01:02:53** And this is one of these things that it has been very present in my life, especially since T-Coi.

**01:03:01** But even without T-Coi, it would have happened anyway of this gradual ratcheting up of pressure from both inside and outside that can make projects just way harder.

**01:03:14** And it's like, yeah, that's totally the byproduct of having a very successful YouTube channel.

**01:03:19** But it doesn't change the fact that, like, oh, would you like to know what this is like?

**01:03:23** Here's one of the things that you might not have considered that there's this ratchet that just increases over time.

**01:03:29** This is one of the things that it's like to do this.

**01:03:32** My assumption is the assumption that I wish I would remember more is that the people listening to this show probably fall into vast majority of them fall into a couple of categories.

**01:03:43** These are people that do make stuff or people that want to.

**01:03:45** Yeah. Or people that are just interested in what the life of the people that are content creators.

**01:03:52** And sometimes I think it would be easier if I could remember that.

**01:03:55** But if you've listened to this conversation and you are an aspiring or starting out content creator, I think the thing that is important not to take away from this is that you need to be an expert.

**01:04:07** Do what we were saying or what Gray was saying he was doing at the beginning where it was research, but not exhaustive like what he does.

**01:04:16** Right. Because the point is still that you can do enough when you're starting out and be, quote unquote, correct enough and do the thing.

**01:04:26** Because if you try and do things to grace level when you're beginning, you're never going to get started.

**01:04:31** You just want, but you don't need to. This is the thing that happens when you reach that point.

**01:04:38** I just feel like that's the thing that if I'm thinking this is a very meta like we're like 17 levels deep into this at this moment.

**01:04:47** But like if I'm thinking about like who listens to the show or who we expect listens to the show, what are they going to take away from this?

**01:04:54** I wouldn't want people to be like, oh, man, I'm never going to finish this video if that's what I have to do.

**01:05:00** I also think part of the value is also just understanding what may be coming down the line.

**01:05:09** This is one of these cases where I had this at the start of my career from knowing like, oh, what is it like to actually be a famous person?

**01:05:19** Oh, there's lots of things about that that are really terrible that people who are famous will not talk about in public for these sorts of reasons.

**01:05:30** They just know they'll get terrible feedback about like, oh, listen to you complaining about your amazing life.

**01:05:35** I feel like that has turned a little bit in the last few years or like a little like at least just I think that seeing the beginning of a change and I think sport is especially a place where it's coming out like mental health in sport.

**01:05:50** I think is it really starting to see a crest here.

**01:05:53** This has been happening quite a bit in tennis, especially in the last maybe year or two.

**01:05:59** There's been a couple of very famous tennis players who have been talking about their mental health issues and how it's affecting them on the court.

**01:06:06** You know, I'm a big F1 fan and it's happening there a little bit more now, too, of people being open with the fact that it can be really hard to do what they do in a way that still a lot of people reject.

**01:06:21** And they're just like, just shut up and play the sport kind of thing.

**01:06:24** But where I see that there is more understanding from younger people, just in general, the generation below us is much more in tune with mental health as a thing, which I think is really good.

**01:06:40** But I think it's allowing for some people in the public eye to start actively talking about what it is like and for that to be accepted more.

**01:06:51** I feel like it's we're still a long way away, I think, from a celebrity being able to openly talk about how their life can be hard because they're a celebrity, because I think there is just this natural thinking of like you are rich and famous.

**01:07:05** What more could you want?

**01:07:07** Yeah, yeah, I found that example under the like quote unacceptable in quotes thing that is acceptable actually to talk about.

**01:07:17** I mean, the sorts of things that people will just not talk about in public.

**01:07:21** I know. But my point more is there will always be that way because that's just people, right?

**01:07:27** There will always be stuff that you say behind closed doors kind of thing.

**01:07:31** But it's more that I think that there is starting to become more of an acceptable change for people to say stuff because a period of time ago, that was unacceptable to say that my life as a celebrity can be hard because of my fame, right?

**01:07:48** I feel like that is a thing that was unacceptable to say.

**01:07:51** So my point is just that it is changing.

**01:07:54** The mental health part of it is becoming more acceptable to suffer with and talk about, right?

**01:08:00** Rather than like, hey, I have these problems that I can't talk to anyone about them or speak about them in open or be out, of course, there will always be difficulties and things that people will go through that they won't talk about in public.

**01:08:12** It's just life.

**01:08:14** Yeah, just in case people are desperately wanting to know what the kind of stuff is that I'm talking about.

**01:08:19** I'll just mention that Tim Ferriss actually has a really interesting article about being famous.

**01:08:24** I know you're going to hate it, but he's like he's the example of what are the kinds of things that people just don't want to talk about.

**01:08:34** Right. So I hate doing this kind of thing where it's like you not saying things in front of the audience.

**01:08:40** Then the leads people wonder is the article 11 reasons not to become famous.

**01:08:44** I don't know what the title of the article is off the top of my head.

**01:08:46** I mean, it probably is the fact that it's a listicle.

**01:08:50** This is like, well, I mean, look, I mean, look, you've got to be honest.

**01:08:54** You've got to optimize for SEO.

**01:08:58** Anyway, like I did not intend to really get off on this major tangent because it's funny.

**01:09:03** Like I actually picked this topic precisely because it has the fewest number of these sorts of problems.

**01:09:10** Yeah. The numbering system for the interstate is, I don't know, as close to math as a topic can get where it's like, yeah, this was just a plan that some people made.

**01:09:22** And here, let me explain what the plan is.

**01:09:24** And it has the smallest number of places where this can go wrong.

**01:09:29** Whereas one of the videos I've been working on for a very long time now that I just don't know if it will ever see the light of day is a video that is related to history.

**01:09:42** And it's just one of those videos where it's really dispiriting because every part you dig into, you can go, oh, but is that true?

**01:09:55** What is the actual source for this?

**01:09:57** How do we know that this is the case?

**01:09:59** And it's like, I really like what this video could be, but it has been now years in the works and just constantly runs up against this.

**01:10:10** What is true problem?

**01:10:12** Oh, also, I'm not an expert in this period of history.

**01:10:17** And so now let me tell you, if there's something that experts can disagree on, it's history.

**01:10:23** And then like, OK, I've got to try to make a call about what is the reasonable way to describe this or what are the parts to skip over.

**01:10:30** And then you also just have the like, everybody always wants you to talk about everything issue as well, which is it is a funny thing with this video on the interstate stuff, because here's another example

**01:10:40** of this reverse problem where lots of people left comments where they're like, oh, but you should have talked about how the mile markers work, that the mile markers are showing you like how far along on the highway you are and all this kind of stuff.

**01:10:55** It's like, I understand that you want me to talk about the mile markers, but actually, they're different in every single state.

**01:11:02** And so the like, oh, you left out this interesting piece of information.

**01:11:06** And the comments are missing.

**01:11:08** Yeah, yeah, yeah. But it doesn't actually work consistently everywhere.

**01:11:12** So this idea that you have of the mile markers are useful as a navigational guide.

**01:11:16** It's like, I didn't talk about that because it's not true.

**01:11:20** And they frequently change just at the state borders.

**01:11:23** So it's just even on a relatively straightforward topic, there's just an endless amount of stuff like this.

**01:11:29** And it is also why, like, on publication day, it's always a huge relief.

**01:11:34** But there's always this feeling of like, oh, God, I hope I just didn't mess up something real bad that I didn't even know about.

**01:11:41** And you never know until it goes out.
