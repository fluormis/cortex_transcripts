# Cortex - 124: Titles Are Hard
**00:00:00** New year, new backup recording setup for you, Mike.

**00:00:04** I've got something different this time.

**00:00:06** New month, new month.

**00:00:07** No, new year, new year, new backup recording setup.

**00:00:10** New month, new system.

**00:00:11** Yeah, I think I'm a genius this time though,

**00:00:14** because some of my previous systems,

**00:00:17** they've been a bit wonky.

**00:00:18** They've had various problems, but this one is like,

**00:00:20** oh wow, why didn't I think of this before?

**00:00:23** I've taken my lav mic and I've blue tacked it

**00:00:28** to the side of my main microphone.

**00:00:31** And this seems like it's perfect.

**00:00:33** How did I not think of this before?

**00:00:35** I don't know, but this is genius.

**00:00:37** So this is my new backup recording system.

**00:00:39** So you should be very happy.

**00:00:41** I'm speaking directly into two microphones.

**00:00:45** There's not a microphone on the other side of the room

**00:00:47** acting as a recorder.

**00:00:49** There's not a microphone on a travel stand on my desk

**00:00:52** to knock onto my keyboard,

**00:00:54** to cancel the recording that I'm currently doing.

**00:00:58** Little lav mic, little blue tack, good to go.

**00:01:01** I actually kind of like this.

**00:01:03** Yeah, I think it's perfect.

**00:01:04** If you're gonna do it, you might as well do it this way.

**00:01:06** Yeah, I think this is the perfect one.

**00:01:08** Speaking of this actually, these various ways

**00:01:11** in which you've destroyed my hopes

**00:01:15** of a good episode recording over the last year.

**00:01:18** That's unfair.

**00:01:19** There is a Cortex animated that I recommend

**00:01:20** everybody go watch.

**00:01:21** I don't think you've seen yet, which you need to watch

**00:01:24** so we can put it up.

**00:01:25** Oh, okay.

**00:01:26** A very wonderful animator, H.M. Boutet,

**00:01:28** did something really special when it comes to levels,

**00:01:30** levels, conversations.

**00:01:32** I don't wanna spoil it, but it's so good.

**00:01:35** It's just so good and it's well worth watching.

**00:01:38** But I'm really happy that it's like new,

**00:01:41** was it new decades dawn again?

**00:01:45** Also includes new microphone systems again.

**00:01:50** This one, mark my words, never gonna change.

**00:01:54** Every year, I like to do a little time tracking

**00:01:57** comparison with you.

**00:02:00** So this, I think first started,

**00:02:01** it was part of our yearly themes episode,

**00:02:03** but as that just got longer and longer,

**00:02:05** I've ended up pushing this out to like a thing

**00:02:07** that I do in January.

**00:02:09** This is actually different now

**00:02:10** than how we've done it in the past.

**00:02:12** Okay.

**00:02:13** Because since our last time that we looked at this,

**00:02:15** I would always bring out my toggle reports

**00:02:18** and would look at my toggle reports at the end.

**00:02:20** But now, wonderful app Timery, favorite app,

**00:02:23** has actually added reporting of its own.

**00:02:26** So the reports that are generated in the screenshot,

**00:02:29** which is in the show notes,

**00:02:30** of my year over year time tracking totals

**00:02:34** were actually generated in Timery this time,

**00:02:37** which I think looks much cleaner.

**00:02:39** It's very nice.

**00:02:40** I'm not surprised about a lot of this

**00:02:42** from like a top line perspective,

**00:02:44** kind of looking at year over year.

**00:02:46** In 2020, I logged 1,507 hours of work.

**00:02:51** In 2021, I logged 1,544 hours of work.

**00:02:56** That's actually crazy how close that is.

**00:02:59** Yeah. That's interesting.

**00:03:01** I think it's especially intriguing to me

**00:03:03** because in 2020, I didn't have any time off.

**00:03:05** And in 2021, I took like a two week vacation.

**00:03:08** Yeah.

**00:03:09** So there's like, I don't know, however many,

**00:03:11** maybe it was like another 50 hours or something

**00:03:13** that would have been logged otherwise.

**00:03:15** I would just again, make this clear

**00:03:17** because I think people get confused about this

**00:03:19** and I understand why.

**00:03:20** I only log when I'm actively working on something.

**00:03:23** So all of that like unintentional time

**00:03:26** that you might have in your work day,

**00:03:28** I don't log that.

**00:03:30** So like if I'm not actively involved in a task,

**00:03:32** I don't log it.

**00:03:33** So like on average, my working hours are like,

**00:03:37** I log maybe like five and a half hours

**00:03:39** of productive time a day.

**00:03:41** Where I'm actually my work day,

**00:03:43** so usually starts between nine and 10

**00:03:46** and ends between six and eight.

**00:03:47** But there's just time in my day where I'm not working

**00:03:50** because I'm a human being.

**00:03:51** So I kind of really, it might be a better way for me to say,

**00:03:55** this is my productive time, not my working time.

**00:03:57** Yeah, that's a good way to work.

**00:03:59** I track my productive time because for me,

**00:04:01** I can have these weird pockets in a day

**00:04:03** because maybe I have something going on between nine and 10

**00:04:07** and then my next thing starts at five o'clock.

**00:04:10** It's just like, that's just how my weird day can be sometimes.

**00:04:14** But I would say by and large,

**00:04:16** everything is held kind of in the way that I would expect.

**00:04:20** So like podcast recording time is relatively steady.

**00:04:24** Editing time has gone down by a decent chunk,

**00:04:27** but that was because I moved more editing away from myself.

**00:04:32** Show prep goes up.

**00:04:33** I always want that to go up.

**00:04:35** Like if there's one thing in these top three going up,

**00:04:38** I would like more preparation for my shows

**00:04:41** because the more prepared I am, the better the content is.

**00:04:44** Look at all Cortex brand rising up the ranks there.

**00:04:47** Yeah, Cortex brand has shot up what, like 100 hours?

**00:04:49** 100 hours a year.

**00:04:50** Jeez.

**00:04:52** There's a load of reasons for this though.

**00:04:54** I mean, one, I do spend a lot more time

**00:04:56** working on our business.

**00:04:58** Another is we have like a monthly call,

**00:05:01** which is just focused on talking about Cortex brand stuff.

**00:05:03** So all of these hours are being logged in now.

**00:05:06** This actually did make me realize

**00:05:09** that I think I need to now start breaking out

**00:05:13** what that is into more projects.

**00:05:15** Okay, so you want to subdivide

**00:05:18** how you're tracking Cortex brand.

**00:05:19** Because if I tracked Relay FM, it would be like 800 hours.

**00:05:25** Oh, right, right, okay, yeah.

**00:05:28** Where now Cortex brand, I mean, it never was,

**00:05:30** but like as I'm now doing more and more,

**00:05:32** spending more and more time on it,

**00:05:34** I'm doing lots of different types of things.

**00:05:36** Sometimes it's admin, sometimes it's product design.

**00:05:40** I think I need to start looking at separating those out.

**00:05:43** In Timey, when you,

**00:05:46** like are you thinking of having them

**00:05:47** as different top level projects?

**00:05:50** Yeah.

**00:05:50** Like I'm actually just looking at the Timey reports.

**00:05:53** And I can't remember,

**00:05:55** when you click on that little arrow next to Cortex brand,

**00:05:57** does that just show you the logged entries

**00:05:59** or does that show you sub projects in that entry?

**00:06:03** I mean, I think if you had sub projects

**00:06:04** or if you named them, I think it would,

**00:06:06** but I don't do any of that.

**00:06:08** Right, right.

**00:06:09** I tag the podcast stuff.

**00:06:11** So recording, editing and show prep,

**00:06:13** I tag those with the related shows.

**00:06:16** But outside of that, I just project.

**00:06:18** That's everything I do.

**00:06:19** Right, so when you hit the little arrow

**00:06:21** next to podcast recording and time rate,

**00:06:23** it shows you the tags for,

**00:06:25** like the time spent in tags

**00:06:26** for the different time to track or not.

**00:06:28** I'm just curious.

**00:06:29** Oh no, it doesn't.

**00:06:30** That doesn't show tags there.

**00:06:32** I guess that would be the descriptions.

**00:06:34** That's all of the descriptions.

**00:06:35** Right, okay.

**00:06:36** So if like, I think you do some of this sometimes, do you?

**00:06:38** Like you write down what you're doing.

**00:06:40** I know a lot of people do this.

**00:06:41** It's like a thing or makes sense that you write down

**00:06:43** what task you're up to.

**00:06:44** Yeah, I'm only asking because we discussed

**00:06:46** a couple episodes about sort of rethinking

**00:06:49** the time tracking, which is where I am.

**00:06:51** And this is one of those areas where I'm trying

**00:06:54** to mentally recategorize the way I do a bunch of stuff.

**00:06:58** And this is always the problem that everyone has

**00:07:00** at the beginning of time tracking, right?

**00:07:01** We were like, how do I categorize

**00:07:02** a bunch of different things?

**00:07:04** And so I'm just, I'm not, I haven't settled on

**00:07:08** how to try to track sub stuff,

**00:07:11** but also have an overall picture of what's going on.

**00:07:13** So I was just curious if you had any thoughts,

**00:07:15** like mechanistically what you're going to do

**00:07:18** with tracking subcategories of Cortex brand

**00:07:21** so that you can have it broken out.

**00:07:22** Yeah, it will probably be like Cortex brand admin,

**00:07:25** Cortex brand design.

**00:07:26** Like that's how I'll do it for now, I think.

**00:07:28** Right, okay.

**00:07:29** This is like a top level thing.

**00:07:30** Yeah.

**00:07:32** Okay, hmm.

**00:07:32** Because I feel like I would, you know,

**00:07:34** I'd be intrigued to see what that would look like.

**00:07:36** Because at the moment that is just one huge bucket

**00:07:38** and that bucket is becoming an increasingly large

**00:07:41** percentage of my time.

**00:07:43** Yeah, and especially since like we just started this year

**00:07:47** breaking out the separate Cortex brand calls,

**00:07:50** which has been a great thing to do.

**00:07:52** I think also like a theme on the show over time

**00:07:54** is like, oh, separate out different activities

**00:07:56** into different areas.

**00:07:57** And it was very good when we realized,

**00:07:59** oh, we should have two calls a month.

**00:08:02** One that's just the Cortex brand stuff

**00:08:04** and one that's just the podcast.

**00:08:06** Yep.

**00:08:06** You want to know in that business,

**00:08:09** how much time are you spending gabbing on the phone

**00:08:12** with Gray versus how much time are you spending

**00:08:14** in product design or admin or all the rest of it?

**00:08:17** So yeah.

**00:08:18** I think so.

**00:08:19** I think once something crosses a hundred hours of work,

**00:08:22** you probably want to at least be aware

**00:08:24** of what the subcategories are.

**00:08:26** Yep.

**00:08:27** So that's one, and again, that's like part of

**00:08:30** your structure.

**00:08:31** It's like that structure, that structural stuff

**00:08:33** that I need to work on.

**00:08:35** Streaming doubled, but that makes sense to me

**00:08:37** because I started streaming like halfway through 2020

**00:08:40** and I still stream keyboard related stuff once a week

**00:08:43** on a Friday.

**00:08:44** And so I've just been doing that more and more.

**00:08:46** So that's just remained as part of my time tracking stuff.

**00:08:50** The Relay FM general admin stuff.

**00:08:53** So this is calls and just general administrative stuff

**00:08:55** I do for Relay FM.

**00:08:56** It's funny, it's lower down the list,

**00:08:58** but more hours than the year before.

**00:09:00** Yeah, that's what I was just looking at.

**00:09:01** But one of the reasons for this is like,

**00:09:03** you'll notice in 2020, membership was more hours,

**00:09:09** 60 hours than the 29 hours in 2021.

**00:09:13** So it was a lot of our admin calls were actually focused

**00:09:16** around the membership program.

**00:09:17** So I would attract those as pure membership calls.

**00:09:20** Right, okay, that makes sense.

**00:09:21** Because we were setting everything up then.

**00:09:23** So like that's probably where that stacks differently.

**00:09:25** I like this big drop in Mega Studio,

**00:09:27** 60 hours last year and down to 15 hours this year

**00:09:31** for like setting it up, I presume is what that is.

**00:09:33** Yeah, that's setting up stuff.

**00:09:35** That's one we would definitely hope

**00:09:36** trends downward over time.

**00:09:38** Until the next one.

**00:09:39** Until Mega Studio 2, yes.

**00:09:40** Yeah, I think so.

**00:09:42** Yeah, Podcast-a-thon definitely took more time.

**00:09:45** I'm actually quite surprised about it though.

**00:09:47** Like I know it took more time,

**00:09:48** but considering how tumultuous the planning

**00:09:50** of the 2020 Podcast-a-thon was,

**00:09:52** I'm surprised that it took more time to do this year.

**00:09:56** Oh, I know what this was.

**00:09:58** I know what this was.

**00:09:59** We did a lot more streams leading up to the Podcast-a-thon.

**00:10:04** That makes sense.

**00:10:04** So those hours, they really racked up compared to 2020.

**00:10:09** I would like to know what you categorize

**00:10:11** as self-improvement here.

**00:10:12** I'm just curious what goes under that category.

**00:10:14** So this is all year of refinement stuff.

**00:10:20** So sometimes this is like maybe meeting a friend for lunch

**00:10:25** with the implicit idea that we're gonna talk about

**00:10:28** how we're doing as people, all that kind of stuff.

**00:10:32** Sometimes these conversations just occur, right?

**00:10:35** But sometimes I feel like, at least with some friends,

**00:10:38** like that's the point of our meeting,

**00:10:40** or like having a call or whatever,

**00:10:42** just to like, how are you doing?

**00:10:43** Let's talk about how you are, that kind of stuff.

**00:10:46** I don't know why this has gone down year over year.

**00:10:49** I think maybe I was doing more of that.

**00:10:51** Yeah, you know what?

**00:10:52** I was doing more of that at beginning of 2020.

**00:10:54** That was the year of refinement, right?

**00:10:56** Yeah, I was gonna say that that trended downward

**00:10:59** because of everything that happened in the world, Mike.

**00:11:03** You were not able to do fancy wine tasting at restaurants.

**00:11:06** But I wouldn't have included that in here anyway,

**00:11:08** but like there was just like a lot of stuff that I was doing

**00:11:11** and like taking like instructional courses

**00:11:14** and things like that,

**00:11:14** and I just stopped doing a lot of it.

**00:11:16** But I'm pleased that it's still there.

**00:11:18** It's like a little more than half of where it was in 2020,

**00:11:22** but it's still a part of it, which I'm pleased about.

**00:11:26** I think that's interesting as a category,

**00:11:27** just as something that relates more directly to the theme.

**00:11:31** Just as someone who is in the podcast business,

**00:11:35** Sponsor Aftercare just makes me smile as a category of,

**00:11:39** I'm like, ah yes, Sponsor Aftercare.

**00:11:43** Yeah, but look how much it's down.

**00:11:45** I'm very glad to see that you've dropped it

**00:11:47** from 18 hours to seven hours.

**00:11:50** I presume that a lot of the Sponsor Aftercare

**00:11:52** has been passed along to others.

**00:11:53** Yes.

**00:11:54** That's great.

**00:11:56** So it's in everything.

**00:11:57** So Sponsor Booking is down, Sponsor Inquiries is down,

**00:12:00** Sponsor Aftercare is down.

**00:12:02** And that would have been like,

**00:12:03** if you looked across the years,

**00:12:04** something that's trending down, down, down,

**00:12:06** which just makes sense as I let go more of that part

**00:12:09** of my responsibility in the business to people

**00:12:11** that are better placed to do it than me.

**00:12:13** So like that's just again,

**00:12:15** like a really great trend down over time

**00:12:17** and it's gonna continue to go down this year.

**00:12:19** It won't go away,

**00:12:21** but it will continue to get a smaller and smaller

**00:12:24** portion of what I do.

**00:12:26** And then I presume that workflows means automation stuff.

**00:12:29** Is that the idea?

**00:12:30** Yeah, it's like tinkering away inside

**00:12:32** with that kind of stuff.

**00:12:33** And I've already been doing a little bit of that.

**00:12:35** And I actually wanna talk about this a little later on

**00:12:37** in the show, but I've been thinking about like

**00:12:39** how this kind of stuff, automation stuff could be a part

**00:12:43** of the year structure.

**00:12:45** I think there could be something in that

**00:12:46** that I hadn't yet considered,

**00:12:48** but it's been bouncing around in my brain a little bit

**00:12:51** since we recorded Lost.

**00:12:53** So for me, like if I look at this and say like,

**00:12:55** how, where do I want this to be next time?

**00:12:57** I want less hours overall.

**00:12:59** So straight up like you want the total number

**00:13:02** of real work hours to be less in 2022.

**00:13:06** I would like an increase in Cortex brand stuff,

**00:13:11** podcast stuff to remain basically the same,

**00:13:14** but with the idea being some of that will naturally start

**00:13:18** to decrease, but that might not happen this year.

**00:13:21** It might be ready for 23 and everything admin related

**00:13:25** to go down more.

**00:13:27** That's kind of like if I was painting a picture

**00:13:29** of what I want my 2022 time tracking to look like,

**00:13:33** that's what it would look like.

**00:13:34** I really like that.

**00:13:35** Cause you also have a like a really clear top level target

**00:13:39** of these, this number of hours should be lower.

**00:13:44** I quite like that.

**00:13:44** I mean, for me, honestly, if it's not,

**00:13:47** that's a big failure because I mean, like part of it is,

**00:13:51** well, if I'm going to take the 20 days off

**00:13:55** that I said I'm going to take

**00:13:57** that would naturally bring it down.

**00:13:59** Right.

**00:14:00** Unless you're squishing around, working in extra work

**00:14:04** at like times you shouldn't,

**00:14:05** which defeats the whole purpose.

**00:14:07** And then that would be like, aha, there you go.

**00:14:09** Right.

**00:14:10** Right.

**00:14:11** Like that's like you, you messed up somewhere where and why.

**00:14:14** Right.

**00:14:15** And then you get yourself into the bad position

**00:14:16** where you're just running yourself ragged before the breaks

**00:14:20** and then you extra need the breaks,

**00:14:22** but then they're less effective

**00:14:23** at what you're trying to have them do

**00:14:24** because you run yourself ragged.

**00:14:25** Yep.

**00:14:26** So yeah, interesting.

**00:14:27** Okay.

**00:14:28** Hmm.

**00:14:29** This episode of Cortex is brought to you by Hello.

**00:14:32** Hello make incredibly comfortable bug wheat pillows.

**00:14:35** Look, you may have never tried a bug wheat pillow.

**00:14:37** You may have never even heard of one.

**00:14:39** They're really different to the regular fluffy pillows

**00:14:41** that you might be used to.

**00:14:42** Hello pillow supports your head and your neck

**00:14:45** and doesn't collapse under the weight of your head

**00:14:47** like a traditional pillow would.

**00:14:49** It stays cool.

**00:14:50** It stays dry.

**00:14:51** Compared to feather and foam pillows,

**00:14:53** it also breathes better as well.

**00:14:54** So it's not going to get warm and humid.

**00:14:56** You don't have to do that thing anymore

**00:14:57** where you flip your pillow to the cool side

**00:14:59** because your hollow pillow is always cool.

**00:15:02** The bug wheat that goes inside, it can be adjusted too.

**00:15:05** So you can either take it out or put it in,

**00:15:07** make the pillow basically exactly the size that you want

**00:15:10** just the way that you like it.

**00:15:12** The closest way I could try and describe

**00:15:14** what a bug wheat pillow feels like,

**00:15:15** it's kind of like a bean bag, but not a bean bag,

**00:15:17** but that's the closest thing I could use

**00:15:19** to try and give you an idea.

**00:15:21** They're really popular.

**00:15:21** They've been used around the world for years.

**00:15:23** You'll find them in fancy hotels and stuff like that.

**00:15:25** I have been sleeping on a hollow pillow

**00:15:27** for nearly three years, every single night.

**00:15:30** I absolutely love it and I'm never going back.

**00:15:33** It gives me just the right amount of support that I want.

**00:15:36** It's super comfortable.

**00:15:37** It stays nice and cool.

**00:15:39** I love it.

**00:15:40** If I ever sleep somewhere else, I'm on a regular pillow.

**00:15:42** I hate it compared to what I'm going to get at home

**00:15:45** with my hollow pillow, really amazing stuff.

**00:15:47** Hollow pillows are made in the USA

**00:15:49** with quality construction and materials.

**00:15:52** The certified organic cotton case is cut and sewn

**00:15:54** for durability and the bug wheat is grown

**00:15:56** and milled in the US as well.

**00:15:58** You should be pretty curious to try one of these things out

**00:16:00** and you can.

**00:16:01** You can sleep on a hollow pillow for 60 nights.

**00:16:04** And if it isn't right for you,

**00:16:05** just send it back for a refund.

**00:16:40** Thanks to Hello for the support of this show and Relay FM.

**00:16:44** While we're looking at some statistics,

**00:16:47** should we finally do the 2021 flighty stats prediction result?

**00:16:52** All right, so this came up in state of the apps 2021.

**00:17:00** I don't know.

**00:17:01** Cause we do it for the year,

**00:17:02** cause this always messes me up, right?

**00:17:04** So we just did 2022, right?

**00:17:07** In 2021, right?

**00:17:08** You always want to go the next year.

**00:17:09** That's what you like to do.

**00:17:10** And I don't like that, but that's what you like to do.

**00:17:12** Oh, right. Yes, that is what I like to do.

**00:17:13** So two state of the apps ago,

**00:17:16** we spoke about whether we predicted if our air miles,

**00:17:21** the amount of miles that we have flown in 2021

**00:17:25** would be higher or lower than what we had done in 2020.

**00:17:29** Right. That's correct.

**00:17:31** That was our prediction.

**00:17:32** Because it was like, well, we haven't gone anywhere in 2020.

**00:17:35** What do we think this is going to be like?

**00:17:38** How optimistic do we feel?

**00:17:40** And we both said that we predicted

**00:17:43** that we would both have traveled for more miles on a plane

**00:17:47** in the calendar year 2021

**00:17:49** than we did in the calendar year 2020.

**00:17:52** I will say as well,

**00:17:53** flighty actually has added a feature quite recently

**00:17:57** that I wanted when we were originally doing all this stuff,

**00:18:01** which is you can now mark a flight

**00:18:03** as like you're not on this flight.

**00:18:05** Yes. Yes.

**00:18:06** Which is good.

**00:18:07** I know I've got some of my 2019 numbers.

**00:18:09** I think maybe even some of my 2020 numbers.

**00:18:12** There's a little bit in there like a flight or two,

**00:18:14** which I don't think was me.

**00:18:15** I was tracking a flight that Adina was on.

**00:18:18** So I'm happy that they've added that now.

**00:18:20** So you can keep your stats clean, basically.

**00:18:23** Yes.

**00:18:24** Yeah. And my reasoning for that bet is,

**00:18:28** I've discussed the concept before of like,

**00:18:30** don't bet against the base rate.

**00:18:32** And so my thought is this is like a combination

**00:18:34** of don't bet against the base rate

**00:18:37** and a sort of regression to the mean

**00:18:39** that 2020 for obvious reasons

**00:18:42** was much lower in travel than normal.

**00:18:44** And so you should sort of expect

**00:18:46** that the number is going to regress toward the mean.

**00:18:50** And I was wrong.

**00:18:54** Really?

**00:18:55** Yeah.

**00:18:56** What about the year of the voyage?

**00:18:59** Well, look, okay.

**00:18:59** So I went back and I actually,

**00:19:02** I cleaned up all of my flighty stats

**00:19:04** and I put in all of the flights from 2018 to now

**00:19:07** because I actually really do like tracking this

**00:19:09** as just a statistic.

**00:19:10** Oh man, that's a good idea.

**00:19:11** I should do that.

**00:19:12** Yeah. Because like I just wanted to know

**00:19:14** and I had started,

**00:19:15** I think I started using flighty halfway through 2018.

**00:19:19** So I went back and I like filled in everything

**00:19:22** just to make sure it was all clear

**00:19:24** and just made sure I didn't have any of those random flights

**00:19:26** that weren't actually mine.

**00:19:28** And so we can make a graph of my numbers.

**00:19:31** So starting in 2018,

**00:19:33** it was 41 flights and 2.4 times around the world.

**00:19:40** And I think 2018 might be my like peak travel year ever,

**00:19:47** maybe like that's quite a lot of flying for me.

**00:19:50** And then it drops to 23 flights,

**00:19:53** 0.9 times around the world for 2019.

**00:19:57** 2020 is where it drops down to six flights

**00:20:01** and 0.4 times around the world.

**00:20:04** And 2021 ended up at five flights,

**00:20:09** 0.4 times around the world,

**00:20:12** but it's basically 9.5 thousand miles versus 11,000 miles.

**00:20:18** So I came in just short for 2021.

**00:20:21** I see you were wrong then.

**00:20:22** Okay.

**00:20:23** Yeah. So I was wrong.

**00:20:25** And I'm sort of extra annoyed at this

**00:20:28** because I did mention that there's a conference

**00:20:31** that I was supposed to go to

**00:20:33** at the very beginning of January,

**00:20:35** which would have had me traveling

**00:20:38** at the very end of December.

**00:20:41** And I made a decision not to go

**00:20:45** because of the basically the situation

**00:20:47** with the Omnicromicon variant

**00:20:50** and like having to decide ahead of time,

**00:20:52** like am I gonna go?

**00:20:53** Am I gonna book the flights?

**00:20:55** And I made the call not to,

**00:20:59** but it is one of these things that in retrospect,

**00:21:03** I think I would have gone

**00:21:05** if I didn't have to make the decision as early as I did

**00:21:08** about like, am I actually gonna go to this thing or not?

**00:21:11** I think you made the right decision.

**00:21:12** It was too unknown again.

**00:21:14** This is what I'm saying.

**00:21:15** At the time, I think I made the correct decision.

**00:21:18** But if I could transmit information back in time,

**00:21:22** I would express to my past self,

**00:21:23** like you're over concerned about this

**00:21:27** at the time that you're worried.

**00:21:29** If you really wanna go to this conference,

**00:21:31** it is actually fine.

**00:21:33** Maybe don't visit your parents on the way in and out,

**00:21:35** but like it's probably fine to go.

**00:21:37** So anyway, I did lose it, but I feel like boy,

**00:21:40** this was a close loss, but it's still a loss.

**00:21:43** So it was less for me this year than last year,

**00:21:47** which I obviously did not expect

**00:21:49** and really has come in as a surprise

**00:21:52** and is obviously a side effect of basically

**00:21:54** the whole pandemic situation dragging on

**00:21:57** longer than I expected.

**00:21:58** So 2019, that's when I have my first dates too.

**00:22:01** I'm probably gonna do what you did actually.

**00:22:02** I like the idea of maybe filling in some old stuff.

**00:22:05** Although I am maybe a bit too lazy

**00:22:07** to try and find all those flights from 2018.

**00:22:09** 2019, 25 flights, 1.9 times around the world

**00:22:14** at 47,679 miles.

**00:22:18** 2020, six flights, 15,765 miles,

**00:22:24** 0.6 times around the world.

**00:22:25** And this is, I have adjusted this.

**00:22:27** I've gone in and removed the flights that weren't mine.

**00:22:31** 2021, eight flights, 21,081 miles around the world.

**00:22:38** So that is 5,000 more, I beat it.

**00:22:40** You must've gone somewhere quite far away, Mike.

**00:22:42** I did, I went to Hawaii.

**00:22:44** Hawaii wouldn't have been enough though.

**00:22:46** Oh really?

**00:22:48** We spent Christmas in Romania

**00:22:49** and that was what I needed to tip me over.

**00:22:52** Oh, okay.

**00:22:53** I didn't, oh, that's closer than I would've thought.

**00:22:55** I thought Hawaii on its own

**00:22:56** would've just totally blown it out of the water.

**00:22:58** No, I think I needed the extra.

**00:23:00** Or at least it was gonna be way closer.

**00:23:02** Because you know, like in 2020,

**00:23:04** we'd started the year off in LA.

**00:23:06** So, and then we did more flights backwards and forwards

**00:23:10** at the beginning of 2020.

**00:23:12** So it would've been closer than I would've expected.

**00:23:15** Just to really make sure that I 100% hit that.

**00:23:19** I had to take that.

**00:23:20** It wasn't the reason that I went to Romania for Christmas,

**00:23:22** but sure helped.

**00:23:27** It's a nice bonus.

**00:23:28** It gives you a nice extra reason.

**00:23:29** You go, oh great, now I can be right in the bet.

**00:23:31** Yep, and I was right and you were wrong.

**00:23:34** Congratulations, Mike.

**00:23:35** And a completely unnecessary,

**00:23:38** but for some reason it's become very important thing for us.

**00:23:41** Because we've been talking about this now

**00:23:43** for the best part of three months, two months.

**00:23:46** Yeah, well I think it's just turned out that flights

**00:23:49** have ended up as a proxy for world status.

**00:23:52** And I also think flights for the situation that we're in,

**00:23:58** they're also a kind of interesting proxy for,

**00:24:02** I don't know if this is quite the right way to phrase it,

**00:24:04** but like semi-optional work.

**00:24:07** I do think there's travel which can be eliminated,

**00:24:13** but can be good to do as well.

**00:24:15** I think that's partly what this is.

**00:24:17** So the question for you, Mike,

**00:24:18** do you think you're going to do any work related flights

**00:24:22** next year?

**00:24:23** This year?

**00:24:24** Yeah, this year.

**00:24:25** It's not still the Christmas season.

**00:24:27** I think it's the Christmas season.

**00:24:28** It kind of does still feel like it.

**00:24:30** It really does, it really does.

**00:24:31** Do I think I will do any work related travel in 2022?

**00:24:36** Yes, I do, I do think that.

**00:24:38** You do think that, okay.

**00:24:39** I do think that.

**00:24:40** I mean, the very least the podcastathon.

**00:24:44** Ah, okay, all right.

**00:24:46** Terrible things would have to happen.

**00:24:50** And or like just huge things, insurmountable things

**00:24:54** would have to occur for us to not be in Memphis

**00:24:57** this time doing that.

**00:24:59** I also expect that by the end of 2022,

**00:25:03** I would have done some other thing,

**00:25:05** some other event or something.

**00:25:07** Okay, so like some event, some conference,

**00:25:10** something like that.

**00:25:10** Yeah.

**00:25:11** Okay.

**00:25:12** Conferences, I doubt, event, I expect more.

**00:25:16** Okay, what do you mean by event?

**00:25:17** What falls into that category?

**00:25:19** I feel like sometimes you can say a thing

**00:25:21** and you're either like, you're putting something out

**00:25:24** into the world, like you're willing it into existence

**00:25:27** or you're jinxing yourself.

**00:25:28** And I don't know which one of these this would be for me.

**00:25:31** All right, don't let me jinx you then, that's fine.

**00:25:33** Well, I mean, I can tell you.

**00:25:35** Okay.

**00:25:36** And then maybe you can tell me if I should keep it

**00:25:38** in the show or not.

**00:25:39** All right, and then you can censor it or not.

**00:25:41** Yeah, exactly.

**00:25:42** Okay.

**00:25:42** I am hoping I'll get invited to an Apple event

**00:25:44** for the end of the year.

**00:25:46** Oh, like an Apple media event.

**00:25:48** Yes.

**00:25:49** Or, ah, okay.

**00:25:51** Surely, huh, okay.

**00:25:52** If there's doing them, I hope that I would maybe

**00:25:54** get invited to one of them.

**00:25:56** Wouldn't that be, don't they do those in London though?

**00:25:59** No, they've not done that for a long time.

**00:26:01** Oh, okay.

**00:26:02** Oh, I thought they had like local versions

**00:26:04** and all these things.

**00:26:04** They used to do that, they used to do that.

**00:26:05** But now if you're invited, they just invite you out

**00:26:08** because the reason they used to do those things

**00:26:10** to my knowledge is it wasn't reliably streamed.

**00:26:13** Ah, okay, right.

**00:26:14** And they used to have like these satellite events

**00:26:17** where they would have a video stream.

**00:26:19** I don't believe they do those anymore

**00:26:21** because I know people that live all over the globe

**00:26:24** that get invited to go to San Francisco or wherever.

**00:26:29** So I'm hoping that if there are events,

**00:26:31** maybe I could get to go.

**00:26:32** Now look, if there's only doing the iPhone event,

**00:26:34** I'm not gonna get too good for that one.

**00:26:36** Maybe they'll do like a Mac event in November

**00:26:38** and maybe I'll get to go.

**00:26:39** Okay, yeah.

**00:26:40** I don't think you're jinxing that.

**00:26:41** I don't think you're jinxing that at all.

**00:26:43** Because I think that's the kind of aspirational

**00:26:45** but also non-zero probability.

**00:26:47** Like I think it's reasonable to say

**00:26:49** that is possible on your calendar.

**00:26:51** It feels much more possible now

**00:26:52** because like on some of my other shows,

**00:26:54** I've interviewed Apple executives

**00:26:56** and I get, you know, like when they send out

**00:26:58** the press invites, I'm on that list now.

**00:27:01** I mean, all it says is tune in,

**00:27:03** but like, you know, it's not like there isn't really

**00:27:06** an RSVP, but I didn't used to get those.

**00:27:09** So like I do get those now.

**00:27:10** So I'm hoping that when they do events again,

**00:27:12** then maybe I would be able to go to one.

**00:27:15** I do think no WWDC by the way,

**00:27:17** if we're putting our bets on that.

**00:27:18** I don't think it's happening.

**00:27:19** Oh yeah, I would bet a lot of money on WWDC.

**00:27:22** I've been saying this for like a year

**00:27:24** that they wouldn't do it again.

**00:27:25** And then now it's just like, nah,

**00:27:28** who's gonna be first, right?

**00:27:29** Yeah.

**00:27:30** Who wants to be the first tech company

**00:27:32** to open up their conferences again?

**00:27:34** Yeah, I mean, I still say if I was in charge of Apple,

**00:27:37** I would never have it in person again.

**00:27:39** I would be delighted to have this as an excuse

**00:27:42** to say we're never doing it.

**00:27:43** I would 100% not have it in person again.

**00:27:45** Oh, you agree with me?

**00:27:46** Okay, everyone else thinks I'm crazy.

**00:27:47** Oh, 100% I agree with you.

**00:27:48** No, no, I agree with you.

**00:27:50** I agree with you big time.

**00:27:51** Oh, okay, great.

**00:27:52** You're the first person I ever would say that.

**00:27:54** It's way better.

**00:27:54** It's way better to do it virtually for everyone.

**00:27:56** I'm not sure it's better for all the participants,

**00:27:58** but if I was Apple, I feel like it's obviously better.

**00:28:00** Oh, it's way better for the participants.

**00:28:02** It's so much better because there's nothing going on

**00:28:05** that's taking your attention away.

**00:28:07** And it's not just available to the 5,000 people

**00:28:10** that can afford it.

**00:28:12** It's available to everyone.

**00:28:13** Everyone gets a level playing field.

**00:28:16** As long as they keep doing things,

**00:28:18** and it's gotten better over the last two years,

**00:28:20** and so we keep finding ways to make developers

**00:28:23** and Apple engineers have a way to communicate

**00:28:25** during that week, as long as they keep making that better

**00:28:28** to replace the labs and stuff,

**00:28:30** it's way better than going in person.

**00:28:32** Do they make all the technical talks

**00:28:34** available immediately online?

**00:28:35** I didn't realize if they were doing,

**00:28:37** I guess there's no tickets.

**00:28:39** You can just see that if you have a developer account.

**00:28:41** Yeah, so do you mean when it was in person?

**00:28:43** So what I mean is the last one that was held online,

**00:28:47** if you have a developer account,

**00:28:48** can you just go watch all of the virtual talks immediately?

**00:28:52** Yeah.

**00:28:53** I don't think I quite realized that.

**00:28:55** They were all just rolled out.

**00:28:56** It was like a schedule through the day,

**00:28:57** and they would just put them out throughout the day.

**00:28:59** I think they maybe all dropped out once, actually,

**00:29:02** this one's gonna be at this time.

**00:29:04** This is what's gonna be on each day,

**00:29:05** and then they just made them all available,

**00:29:07** and you could just go and watch whatever you wanted,

**00:29:09** and everyone could do that.

**00:29:10** To be fair, you could do that before.

**00:29:12** I think they used to stream them in the later years,

**00:29:14** and they would have videos,

**00:29:16** but I think it's better,

**00:29:17** because everyone's just level playing field.

**00:29:20** The production value is so much better.

**00:29:23** I've never watched a session before,

**00:29:25** but I've watched some of these ones

**00:29:27** that they've done afterwards,

**00:29:28** because they're just better than they were

**00:29:30** when they were on a stage.

**00:29:31** Because as well, when they're on a stage,

**00:29:33** you'd have to sometimes fill in amount of time,

**00:29:35** or whatever, but this is just like,

**00:29:36** this is seven minute one, whatever.

**00:29:38** That's all I've got to say on this matter, I don't know.

**00:29:41** I think it's better for them to just do it like this.

**00:29:44** I understand that people wanna be in person.

**00:29:46** I get it, right?

**00:29:47** It was a, you know,

**00:29:48** I could just bring the most amount of friends together,

**00:29:51** or whatever.

**00:29:52** I'd see people I would never see,

**00:29:54** but you're just thinking about it logically.

**00:29:56** This is just a better way to do it.

**00:29:58** If you're the company making a decision,

**00:30:01** I think it's done.

**00:30:02** Would you bet money on Apple

**00:30:05** never doing it again in person?

**00:30:07** Like, do you think that that's what they're actually

**00:30:08** going to do or not?

**00:30:09** It depends how much, but yes, I would put a bet.

**00:30:12** Okay.

**00:30:13** You think they'll never do it again in person.

**00:30:15** Very interesting.

**00:30:15** Because I don't think it's gonna happen this year, right?

**00:30:18** And that's three years, right?

**00:30:21** Or like three WWDCs.

**00:30:23** At that point, what's the point?

**00:30:26** You know?

**00:30:31** I like your whispered pitch of that.

**00:30:33** Well, cause there are lots of points, right?

**00:30:35** There's loads of reasons,

**00:30:36** but if you're making the decision,

**00:30:40** you've got to ask like,

**00:30:41** why is this better to go back in person again?

**00:30:44** Cause I,

**00:30:46** for the vast majority of reasons that realistically matter,

**00:30:51** there isn't a good one.

**00:30:52** Yeah, I don't know if they're gonna do it.

**00:30:53** Like I'm quite interested in this question

**00:30:56** of will they do one in person or not?

**00:30:58** I don't have an opinion on what Apple will actually do.

**00:31:01** I just feel like, man, I would never do it.

**00:31:03** I think we are multiple years away from a large company

**00:31:07** feeling confident from an optics perspective even,

**00:31:11** saying we invite thousands of people

**00:31:15** from all around the world to come here.

**00:31:18** Right.

**00:31:18** Like that just feels,

**00:31:20** like I believe stuff like that's going to happen again.

**00:31:24** I'm confident in that,

**00:31:26** but I just think after a certain amount of time,

**00:31:29** like three years of things being a certain way,

**00:31:33** I just can't imagine it being like,

**00:31:35** oh, hey, you remember how it used to be?

**00:31:36** We're just gonna do that again.

**00:31:38** Like that seems unlikely to me.

**00:31:41** Especially like a cautious company,

**00:31:43** especially a company like Apple,

**00:31:45** which is like people will be like just so excited

**00:31:50** to be the person to write the story of all the people

**00:31:52** that had a minor COVID outbreak.

**00:31:54** Because you know what I mean?

**00:31:55** Yeah, I mean, that's one of my main thoughts.

**00:31:57** Like whenever you get a bunch of people together,

**00:32:00** as a company, you're just running like the risk

**00:32:03** of random downside events of just like,

**00:32:07** there's people in person, stuff can go wrong.

**00:32:10** Like one, and now one of those things is like,

**00:32:12** oh, you were a super spreader event.

**00:32:15** And so that's why I just look at that,

**00:32:17** I'm like, man, you have a bunch of people

**00:32:19** in real life together,

**00:32:21** you're just inviting random downside events.

**00:32:23** I don't even think it's just COVID, right?

**00:32:25** I think there's gonna be a certain thing

**00:32:28** that sticks around for a long time of like,

**00:32:30** it was an influencer outbreak.

**00:32:32** And it's just like, that wasn't a thing

**00:32:33** we ever paid attention to before.

**00:32:35** But I could imagine news articles written about this

**00:32:39** and people caring about it in a way

**00:32:42** we never would have cared about before.

**00:32:45** Because there's gonna be all this like stuff

**00:32:47** that sticks around for a while, like contact tracing.

**00:32:52** I think that we're just gonna have these things

**00:32:53** that just, they hang around for a really long time,

**00:32:58** even after we've gotten through all of this,

**00:33:01** which I still think is like a significant amount

**00:33:04** of time away.

**00:33:05** And then there's gonna be, I think multiple years

**00:33:07** at least afterwards of like these hang on things

**00:33:11** that we haven't gotten rid of.

**00:33:14** And I just think that like,

**00:33:16** I don't think that that kind of outlook on the world

**00:33:21** gives itself to like, hey, I'm a tech company

**00:33:25** and I'm gonna hold an event.

**00:33:27** Like festivals will come back before that stuff

**00:33:31** because it's like, well, music festivals,

**00:33:32** what are you gonna do?

**00:33:33** They're music festivals.

**00:33:34** This is the entire business of this company

**00:33:37** is music festivals.

**00:33:38** Who's gonna blame them, right?

**00:33:39** But if you're like Microsoft, Google and Apple,

**00:33:43** their entire business is not to develop a conference

**00:33:45** that they have once a year.

**00:33:47** They've proven that it's not necessary for them.

**00:33:51** And then all of these other things

**00:33:53** are gonna start dying off.

**00:33:54** Like E3, the gaming conference, it's gone now, I think.

**00:33:57** Like when we're recording,

**00:33:58** it's like they canceled the in-person event, which is June.

**00:34:02** And then it seems like they've canceled

**00:34:04** their online event and like,

**00:34:05** Ash is gonna go away now.

**00:34:06** And then there'll be other things that pop up,

**00:34:08** which is like all of the gaming companies

**00:34:10** having their own events, because who needs E3?

**00:34:12** It's just like, there will be these ebbs and flows.

**00:34:15** And I just think that like Google, Microsoft and Apple,

**00:34:20** they have like the sliding scale

**00:34:21** of a requirement to do this thing.

**00:34:23** And I think it goes in that exact opposite.

**00:34:25** Apple feels the least important to Microsoft,

**00:34:28** they do it biggest and boldest

**00:34:30** because they also use it as like a sales event

**00:34:33** for their services, right?

**00:34:35** So I feel like their one, like build,

**00:34:37** I reckon is most likely to come back

**00:34:39** out of the three of them.

**00:34:40** But I still don't, I still think

**00:34:41** we're multiple years away from that.

**00:34:42** Cause it's just too much risk.

**00:34:44** There's your aside about tech conferences.

**00:34:47** Yeah, I just find it interesting

**00:34:48** trying to make predictions in this way.

**00:34:51** That's what I've just thought about a bunch

**00:34:52** of like what will happen with this stuff,

**00:34:55** cause I went to those Apple conferences

**00:34:57** and I can just easily imagine never going

**00:35:00** to one of those Apple conferences again,

**00:35:01** because they never happen.

**00:35:03** And like things will change, right?

**00:35:05** Like we thought about like,

**00:35:06** well, when we're comfortable to do so,

**00:35:08** like we would do live shows again,

**00:35:10** but they wouldn't be as part of that.

**00:35:12** Right.

**00:35:13** Like maybe we do, oh, we're gonna do a live show

**00:35:15** in San Francisco and so on and so on and so on.

**00:35:17** Which is the thing we did.

**00:35:18** So like our fifth anniversary show,

**00:35:20** I think it was the maybe the biggest

**00:35:21** or second biggest live show we'd ever done.

**00:35:23** And it was just like on a random date in August,

**00:35:26** but like you can do it.

**00:35:27** Like, you know, we're not gonna put like 700 people

**00:35:30** into a theater in San Jose on like a random time,

**00:35:34** but you can do these other things.

**00:35:35** We've done live shows before.

**00:35:36** Like we do that.

**00:35:37** It's like stuff like that I can imagine, right?

**00:35:39** Rather than like, oh, the only reason

**00:35:41** we're doing a live show is because

**00:35:42** the Apple conferences in town.

**00:35:45** It's just, I just, I don't know if I see that stuff happening

**00:35:49** for a while, like, you know, if I'm proven wrong on this,

**00:35:52** like I would feel happy in a way because it means

**00:35:55** that the situation has improved faster than I imagined.

**00:35:59** But I just, I feel pretty confident in my outlook on this.

**00:36:03** Okay, so what is your final prediction

**00:36:06** for overall flights for you for 2022?

**00:36:08** Up or down?

**00:36:10** Up.

**00:36:11** Up, okay.

**00:36:12** Up.

**00:36:14** But like not to like 2019 levels, right?

**00:36:17** Okay.

**00:36:18** But it will be up.

**00:36:19** Cause you know, there will be some,

**00:36:21** like maybe a couple of European trips in the,

**00:36:24** or maybe one more American trip than 2021.

**00:36:28** Okay.

**00:36:28** What about you?

**00:36:29** It's gonna be up.

**00:36:31** And I'm extremely confident that it's going to be up.

**00:36:35** Because I too have a trip booked for Hawaii.

**00:36:43** Oh yeah.

**00:36:44** Yeah, okay.

**00:36:45** I wondered if you were going to mention that.

**00:36:47** Yeah.

**00:36:48** I love the difference in the way we both mentioned this.

**00:36:53** Like going to Hawaii.

**00:36:54** Oh man, it's so great.

**00:36:55** I'm going to Hawaii.

**00:36:59** You're just like just shrinking, as you're saying.

**00:37:03** It's, it's a very physically uncomfortable states

**00:37:08** and jellyfish everywhere.

**00:37:11** Yes.

**00:37:12** So that is on my calendar for next year.

**00:37:16** And it does, it also just totally makes sense.

**00:37:18** Just as last year I was like,

**00:37:21** I am seeing my family and that is going to happen.

**00:37:25** Part of that was also just arranging for

**00:37:27** my wife's family is in Hawaii.

**00:37:28** And it's like, she has not seen them in forever.

**00:37:31** So we are also going to go see them.

**00:37:33** So it's only fair.

**00:37:34** Yeah.

**00:37:35** We just, we weren't going to do both trips

**00:37:36** at the same time as well.

**00:37:37** Like that just didn't make sense for a variety of reasons.

**00:37:40** So we scheduled this out of like, okay,

**00:37:42** I'm going to do my trip and then we're going to do a trip

**00:37:44** to Hawaii.

**00:37:45** So, and since I'll be stopping off and seeing my parents

**00:37:49** on the way as well, I feel like going to Hawaii

**00:37:51** and back on its own basically gets me,

**00:37:55** I think, I think it would actually have me go past

**00:37:59** my previous year's flights,

**00:38:01** having to stop off in North Carolina.

**00:38:02** So 100%.

**00:38:03** Oh yeah, that would for sure.

**00:38:04** Right?

**00:38:05** Yeah.

**00:38:06** 100% I'm going to beat next year's flights.

**00:38:08** Even if that ends up being the only trip that I do,

**00:38:10** which I really hope that it is not the only trip that I do.

**00:38:14** But so I've got one thing alone that'll have the flights

**00:38:17** be higher than before, which I think is good.

**00:38:20** My 2018 numbers are probably too high

**00:38:22** for how much flying happens.

**00:38:24** Like I don't think I need to do that much travel, but.

**00:38:26** No, you know you don't.

**00:38:27** Yeah.

**00:38:28** Yeah.

**00:38:29** You know you don't.

**00:38:30** But the last two years were definitely under

**00:38:32** whatever is the optimal amount of traveling.

**00:38:33** Somewhere in the middle, right?

**00:38:35** I think we're both feeling that.

**00:38:36** Somewhere in the middle is what we would prefer.

**00:38:40** This episode of Cortex is brought to you by FitBod.

**00:38:43** It's super normal for people to start considering

**00:38:45** their health and fitness around this time of year.

**00:38:47** But look, between balancing work,

**00:38:49** your family commitments,

**00:38:50** and everything else you got going on,

**00:38:52** it can be hard to make fitness a priority.

**00:38:55** What you need is a program that works with you,

**00:38:57** not against you.

**00:38:58** And that's why you need FitBod.

**00:39:00** FitBod's algorithm learns about you,

**00:39:02** your goals and training ability,

**00:39:04** and will craft a personalized exercise plan

**00:39:07** that is unique to you.

**00:39:08** A net app makes it incredibly easy to learn

**00:39:10** exactly how to perform each exercise.

**00:39:13** Personal fitness is an amount of competing with other people.

**00:39:15** You don't need to, and you don't want to

**00:39:17** look to others and try and stack up against them,

**00:39:19** try and be what they are and do what they do.

**00:39:22** What you want is something that works for you.

**00:39:24** We're all different.

**00:39:25** And that's when it's really gonna stick.

**00:39:27** When you see the results that you're looking for,

**00:39:29** and FitBod uses data to create and adjust

**00:39:32** your own dynamic fitness plan.

**00:39:34** You'll have instant access to your own

**00:39:35** personalized routine in a fantastic app,

**00:39:38** so you can make progress on your goals from anywhere.

**00:39:41** What I love about FitBod is the app.

**00:39:44** The way that it works with my Apple Watch.

**00:39:46** Recently it had a great new redesign,

**00:39:48** and one of my favorite things that they added.

**00:39:51** So they have these really wonderful HD video tutorials.

**00:39:54** They show you how to do each exercise,

**00:39:55** which I find a big benefit,

**00:39:57** so I can actually see how to perform them.

**00:39:59** But in the new update, these videos have multiple angles,

**00:40:02** so you can see exactly how to do it,

**00:40:04** and maybe you're missing something,

**00:40:05** maybe you're looking in a mirror and you wanna match it up.

**00:40:07** With this new update, it's so easy to do.

**00:40:09** Everyone's fitness path is different,

**00:40:11** which is why FitBod does so much work

**00:40:13** to make sure that they customize things exactly to suit you.

**00:40:16** They make sure to learn from your last workout,

**00:40:17** so your next will be even better,

**00:40:19** whether you work out twice a day or twice a week.

**00:40:21** FitBod even tracks your muscle recovery

**00:40:23** to make sure your plan is balanced

**00:40:25** with a variety of exercises

**00:40:27** to make sure that you're not overworking anything.

**00:40:30** Personalized training of this quality can be expensive,

**00:40:33** but FitBod is just $12.99 a month or 79.99 a year.

**00:40:38** But you can get 25% off your membership

**00:40:40** by signing up at fitbod.me slash cortex.

**00:40:44** You'll get those brand new HD video tutorials,

**00:41:04** A thanks to FitBod for the support of this show

**00:41:06** and Relay FM.

**00:41:08** Speaking of travel,

**00:41:11** I wanted to give a piece of follow-up

**00:41:13** about travel focus mode.

**00:41:15** Cause if you remember some time ago,

**00:41:18** I think this may have also been in State of the Apps.

**00:41:20** Yeah, it was.

**00:41:21** Cause that was where you really wanted

**00:41:22** to talk about focus modes, was during State of the Apps.

**00:41:26** I set up my travel home screen for my trip,

**00:41:28** and I just wanted to say it worked great.

**00:41:31** Oh, great. Yeah.

**00:41:32** The idea of a travel focus mode,

**00:41:34** that did not work out for me.

**00:41:36** Cause I have decided the focus mode system,

**00:41:40** by and large is not what I want

**00:41:42** because of how tricky it is to maintain.

**00:41:45** What do you mean?

**00:41:46** So with the focus mode system, right?

**00:41:48** You are starting with no one can contact you,

**00:41:52** no apps can get through,

**00:41:53** and then you have to manually add in

**00:41:55** all the things you want to get through.

**00:41:57** Mm-hmm.

**00:41:58** I would prefer it the other way around.

**00:42:00** I would prefer to remove things.

**00:42:04** The people part, I would like to add people,

**00:42:07** but to remove apps as being able to notify.

**00:42:11** Because let's imagine I have a travel focus mode,

**00:42:16** that I set up.

**00:42:17** And then in two years time from when I set that up,

**00:42:21** I have a new chat app.

**00:42:22** Like there's the Slack replacement

**00:42:24** that everyone's using, right?

**00:42:25** Mm-hmm.

**00:42:27** And I go traveling,

**00:42:28** but I want that app to still get me,

**00:42:31** but I don't remember.

**00:42:32** I need to add it into the focus mode

**00:42:34** as like being allowed to notify me.

**00:42:37** Hmm.

**00:42:38** Like just the idea of me having to remember

**00:42:41** every app I might possibly want

**00:42:43** and adding it in doesn't work for my brain.

**00:42:46** Where I would prefer to be like,

**00:42:47** hey, I don't want to hear from you while I'm doing this,

**00:42:49** and then remove it from the focus mode.

**00:42:52** Yeah, I was just quickly looking.

**00:42:54** And I'm actually surprised that there isn't a way

**00:42:57** that you can just do that.

**00:42:58** They don't let you select all apps.

**00:43:00** Exactly.

**00:43:01** There's no option where you can just say,

**00:43:02** select all, add all of them, and take them off.

**00:43:04** And that new stuff will just come in

**00:43:06** as normal until you tell it no.

**00:43:08** Like that's what I would want.

**00:43:09** That just creation process just fits me better

**00:43:13** as someone who's moving around.

**00:43:14** And like, you know, that's just what I would prefer.

**00:43:17** I do just want to pause there.

**00:43:18** Like I'm fairly certain,

**00:43:20** although now you're making me doubt myself,

**00:43:22** that I think that when you do add a new app,

**00:43:27** it will put like a, not an interruptive notification,

**00:43:30** but it will put something on your lock screen

**00:43:32** the first time you get a notification saying like,

**00:43:34** hey, do you want this to come through or not?

**00:43:36** I think that's the time sensitive notifications thing,

**00:43:38** which is a whole different califish.

**00:43:41** So I would prefer that.

**00:43:43** However, the focus mode that I have that I use the most,

**00:43:47** or the two that I use, the fitness and the recording ones,

**00:43:49** they're great, I'm happy that they exist,

**00:43:51** and they're not gonna change

**00:43:52** because it's like during these times,

**00:43:54** I don't want to know anything

**00:43:55** except maybe there's one thing, so that's great.

**00:43:57** But the idea of having a travel focus mode for me,

**00:44:00** it's just too complex.

**00:44:02** And I just use do not disturb a lot more often.

**00:44:05** But I ended up really loving travel home screen.

**00:44:10** Okay, what'd you put on it?

**00:44:11** And I ended up with that travel home screen

**00:44:13** being my home screen for the entire time I was away.

**00:44:17** Because originally for me, it was just gonna be,

**00:44:19** hey, while you're moving around, right?

**00:44:21** But I ended up basically having a combo of travel

**00:44:24** and vacation home screen together.

**00:44:27** And it ended up, I added a couple of things to it

**00:44:29** from the last time.

**00:44:30** I added a Carrot and Fantastical to that,

**00:44:35** which made sense for me for when I was traveling.

**00:44:37** But other than that, it remained the same.

**00:44:39** It was like I had my Tripsy and Flighty as widgets,

**00:44:44** and then I added Carrot and Fantastical on top of those.

**00:44:46** I had my Notes stack of widgets

**00:44:49** with the relevant trip that I'm on,

**00:44:52** the Find My ones for my AirTags,

**00:44:55** and then just Camera, Instagram, Maps,

**00:44:57** the Wallet app, Messages, Slack,

**00:45:00** the airline that I was gonna be using next,

**00:45:02** and then a relevant app.

**00:45:03** So for example, when we were going to Disney,

**00:45:05** I had the Disneyland app on there.

**00:45:08** What about the Tides?

**00:45:09** Were you tracking the Tides?

**00:45:10** Wasn't tracking the Tides this time.

**00:45:12** But if I ever need to track the Tides

**00:45:14** and see whether the East one is receiving or not,

**00:45:17** then I know I could add that into a stack

**00:45:19** for that very important info.

**00:45:21** Okay, right, yeah.

**00:45:22** So I really enjoyed the Travel Home Screen.

**00:45:24** So that was a good addition that I'm gonna keep using.

**00:45:28** Yeah, it is quite nice to have something like that

**00:45:29** for when you're just in that different mode.

**00:45:32** And it's interesting to hear that it's still useful

**00:45:33** to you just as the home screen,

**00:45:34** even if it's not the complete focus mode.

**00:45:36** Yeah, and I wasn't expecting to have it to the whole time.

**00:45:39** Like for me, it was like,

**00:45:40** you're getting on a plane today, here's your home screen.

**00:45:43** But it ended up being just the right amount of stuff

**00:45:46** and the right amount of information

**00:45:48** for when I'm vacationing.

**00:45:51** Have you set up any more focus modes, as you last spoke?

**00:45:53** It's one of those things,

**00:45:54** I've been playing around with it more,

**00:45:56** but I don't have anything really concrete to report.

**00:46:00** The only, I find myself, as always with this stuff,

**00:46:04** you immediately start wanting more features instantly.

**00:46:06** And one of the things I was thinking about is like,

**00:46:08** oh, just like I can change all these apps on my home screen,

**00:46:13** I immediately also want the computers

**00:46:15** to be able to be different too.

**00:46:16** I was thinking about that, like, oh,

**00:46:18** it would be nice if I had kind of changed the way

**00:46:20** my computer desktop works

**00:46:22** when the different home screens come up.

**00:46:24** So no, I haven't done anything

**00:46:25** that's really concrete to report with the focus modes,

**00:46:28** but I have, I mean, we could talk about this

**00:46:31** a little bit later, but I've found myself like,

**00:46:35** sort of like we discussed last time with the themes,

**00:46:38** I feel like I'm still really in the middle of this.

**00:46:41** This is one of these things I can really feel my brain

**00:46:43** like churning over a bunch in a way.

**00:46:47** And I just haven't quite resolved

**00:46:50** where it is that I'm going to be with this.

**00:46:52** I hope that they're going to add more to it, WWDC.

**00:46:55** But I doubt it.

**00:46:56** I was like, oh, that's something I would not bet money on.

**00:47:00** That's almost that phrase.

**00:47:01** I kind of wish I would stop saying it

**00:47:03** because I feel like I'm always just setting myself up

**00:47:06** for disappointment.

**00:47:07** Like they will add something to this feature,

**00:47:09** but it probably been a couple of years.

**00:47:11** Year over year iteration on this, I doubt.

**00:47:13** Yeah, Apple's not great at improving a new software feature

**00:47:18** two years in a row.

**00:47:19** I feel like they have a really terrible track record on that.

**00:47:22** So that's definitely a lesson learned from multiple WWDCs.

**00:47:24** The only thing I can think of where they've done this

**00:47:28** consistently is shortcuts.

**00:47:29** Every year shortcuts gets some new stuff.

**00:47:33** Now you may end up with something still broken

**00:47:36** or not the way you want them for a long period of time,

**00:47:39** folders, like we wanted folders for a long time

**00:47:42** until they added them.

**00:47:44** But there is always new stuff being added to shortcuts

**00:47:48** every single year.

**00:47:49** And that isn't the same for everything that they do.

**00:47:52** So how's your theme going, Mike?

**00:47:53** Pretty good, you know, I will say it like,

**00:47:55** compared to previous years,

**00:47:57** I was really, I really only started my theme

**00:48:01** like the very end of December.

**00:48:03** But I do, you know, in past years,

**00:48:05** I've been starting it in kind of like November

**00:48:08** because that's when I've decided on it.

**00:48:10** Once I've decided on my theme,

**00:48:11** I have to set up my new journal and start immediately on it.

**00:48:14** Like I feel like once I know what my theme is,

**00:48:18** I don't wanna keep doing the old theme

**00:48:20** out with the old and with the new.

**00:48:21** Yeah, that makes total sense, I get that.

**00:48:23** So my theme, the year of structure,

**00:48:25** what I've been doing for the last 30 days or whatever

**00:48:30** is really paying attention to what my days feel like.

**00:48:36** And I'm currently like really focused

**00:48:39** on where my free time is

**00:48:41** and trying to work out what's causing it

**00:48:43** or what's taking it away.

**00:48:45** And what I've noticed so far in January

**00:48:48** is that my diary feels way better right now.

**00:48:51** Like my calendar feels way less restrictive

**00:48:54** than the tail end of 2021.

**00:48:57** And like, I think that indicated that like,

**00:48:58** I had a lot more going on then,

**00:49:01** which kind of makes sense to me.

**00:49:02** I kind of established really

**00:49:04** that I have a few busy periods in the year

**00:49:06** and the end of the year is one of them,

**00:49:08** like especially like November, December.

**00:49:10** This is mostly dictated by like Apple events

**00:49:13** and the podcastathon, things like that.

**00:49:15** So, you know, I'm recognizing now

**00:49:17** like some paying attention,

**00:49:18** okay, this time of the year, less going on.

**00:49:22** I'm also calmer and like,

**00:49:24** still feeling the good effects of time off.

**00:49:26** So less tense, so like that's been helping a lot.

**00:49:30** And what I'm trying to focus on at the moment

**00:49:32** is what I'm enjoying about having that space

**00:49:36** as well as why it's there.

**00:49:38** And then when I'm recognizing that I have some free time

**00:49:41** making the most of it in some way,

**00:49:43** whether that's just doing something for me,

**00:49:46** maybe it's playing some more video games,

**00:49:49** or maybe it's spending the time to sit down

**00:49:52** and draw out some product ideas or sit down

**00:49:55** and think about some show topic ideas, that kind of stuff.

**00:49:58** So like I'm trying to make the most of it.

**00:50:01** So later on, I can remember and stay focused on

**00:50:05** why I wanna make sure I have this time, right?

**00:50:08** So like I'm being conscious of it right now.

**00:50:11** So spending that time well,

**00:50:13** so if I allow myself to start drifting

**00:50:15** in the opposite direction, I can feel bad about it.

**00:50:19** I was like, no, you like that, remember?

**00:50:21** So this is what you could,

**00:50:23** because again, it's like one of the things

**00:50:25** that I am aware of and I know I gotta do

**00:50:28** is cut things, right?

**00:50:30** I know I have to cut things out.

**00:50:33** The problem is I don't really wanna do that.

**00:50:35** Like I don't want to cut projects out

**00:50:38** because I love all the things that I do,

**00:50:40** but I know that if I don't,

**00:50:41** I'm gonna end up back in the situation that I was in,

**00:50:44** but worse.

**00:50:46** So I know I need to do that.

**00:50:49** And so by proving to myself why this is good

**00:50:51** to have this extra time in my days,

**00:50:54** it will help me make the tougher decisions down the road,

**00:50:57** I think, about what that's gonna be.

**00:51:00** And I am coming to terms more with the fact

**00:51:04** that I'm going to have to do this,

**00:51:05** like more than a month ago from now.

**00:51:09** Is January, you have more free time in January

**00:51:11** just because your recording schedule is lighter?

**00:51:13** Like is that what's actually causing you

**00:51:15** to have more free time like this?

**00:51:16** I mean, my recording schedule is mostly the same

**00:51:18** throughout the entire year with the occasional blip,

**00:51:21** but it's all the other stuff that's around it.

**00:51:24** Okay, okay.

**00:51:25** Whether it's like big episodes or like additional planning

**00:51:29** and all like it's also a lot of it is for me,

**00:51:32** it's not actually a lot of the time,

**00:51:34** it's how I'm feeling and how that affects everything.

**00:51:37** Like if I'm feeling more stressed, everything's worse,

**00:51:39** you know, et cetera, et cetera.

**00:51:41** Yeah, that's true.

**00:51:42** And what I'm also trying to do at the moment

**00:51:44** is to be more intentional about the time that I have,

**00:51:47** whether it's like doing nothing,

**00:51:50** but making sure I'm aware that I'm making that choice

**00:51:54** or doing something with that time.

**00:51:56** So it is going back to that intentionality stuff

**00:51:59** that you've spoken about a bunch,

**00:52:01** but it's like, it's totally cool

**00:52:02** if I'm just gonna like rebuild a keyboard,

**00:52:06** but just be aware of the fact that this time

**00:52:08** is like a gift for myself rather than just like

**00:52:12** spinning around on my chair in the studio

**00:52:15** and being like, what shall I do?

**00:52:16** You know?

**00:52:18** So I'm being a little bit more careful with my calendar

**00:52:23** and trying to structure things more correctly.

**00:52:25** You know, like if I have two things

**00:52:28** that are gonna take up a bunch of time,

**00:52:29** try and put those on the same day rather than different days

**00:52:33** because then it'll lose one day, not two days.

**00:52:35** Like I had a family thing

**00:52:37** and I also wanted to have lunch with someone

**00:52:40** and I decided to put those on the same day

**00:52:42** because they wouldn't have over that anyway,

**00:52:43** but that means well, that's one day lost,

**00:52:45** not like over half of two days lost.

**00:52:48** Right, right.

**00:52:49** And then something happened recently,

**00:52:51** which was really like reinforced everything.

**00:52:54** It had a bit of work drama, just like a whole thing.

**00:52:58** Some paperwork got messed up and we had to fix it,

**00:53:00** but it was like a load of ramifications from it.

**00:53:03** And it took up an entire day of my time.

**00:53:07** Now it just so happened that that day

**00:53:10** had nothing on the schedule.

**00:53:13** So I was able to fix it in one day with a clear head.

**00:53:16** And if I would have been busy,

**00:53:19** especially unnecessarily busy on that day,

**00:53:22** it wouldn't have been taken care of so easily

**00:53:24** because it was one of those things where it's like,

**00:53:27** issue has been highlighted, I can do this thing,

**00:53:29** pass it over, but then I need to be around

**00:53:32** to talk through more of it later on.

**00:53:34** And I don't know when that's gonna be in the day.

**00:53:37** And like, if I wouldn't have been like empty that day,

**00:53:40** it would have been way more stressful, more of a nightmare.

**00:53:43** And so like, it was just another thing that again,

**00:53:45** if I'm thinking about it, it's like, all right,

**00:53:47** why did this go well for me?

**00:53:49** Well, because I had the time and space to handle it.

**00:53:54** So this is like, at the moment, I'm really in that like,

**00:53:57** this is what I was talking about,

**00:53:58** the exploratory phase of what this theme is going to mean.

**00:54:02** Like the difference in my 2022 theme to my other themes

**00:54:06** is like, I usually go in and I'm like, right,

**00:54:09** I know what I wanna do and now I'm gonna go do it.

**00:54:12** Like, or like day one, I'm doing it.

**00:54:15** But it isn't like that for me this time.

**00:54:17** It's like day one, I'm starting to work it out.

**00:54:20** What does this mean?

**00:54:21** What is this going to mean?

**00:54:23** And that's the bigger difference for me this time.

**00:54:25** But I feel like I'm in that mode and I'm coming to 2022

**00:54:29** with the right frame of mind.

**00:54:32** And I'm pretty happy with how it's going so far.

**00:54:34** So there was one thing I mentioned earlier,

**00:54:37** like I was thinking about this,

**00:54:38** if there are maybe ways that I can,

**00:54:41** someone hadn't thought about before, but could be cool,

**00:54:43** like to use my technology and my computer

**00:54:45** to help add more structure and systems.

**00:54:47** Like I was thinking like maybe more automation stuff.

**00:54:50** Like I'm not sure, but like it's just like an idea

**00:54:52** I had in my head where it's like,

**00:54:54** oh, like is there a way that I can use my apps

**00:54:58** and computer more efficiently to help me build this structure?

**00:55:03** Like I have a calendar app.

**00:55:06** But can the calendar app help me more?

**00:55:09** Like, you know what I'm saying?

**00:55:11** I feel like computers can do really smart things.

**00:55:14** What can I do?

**00:55:15** How can I leverage all of the stuff that I use

**00:55:18** to help me reinforce and build that structure?

**00:55:21** Like this is just something which I had this thought today.

**00:55:24** I wrote it down in a document and I'm like,

**00:55:25** oh, I want to noodle on that one a little bit.

**00:55:28** Like what could that mean?

**00:55:29** I'm not sure.

**00:55:30** Right, so you don't have any specifics with that thought.

**00:55:32** No, not at all, but it was just something where I thought,

**00:55:35** hang on a minute, like maybe there's something in this.

**00:55:38** You know?

**00:55:39** Because we have so many friends, like David Sparks.

**00:55:43** I feel like David's computer just

**00:55:45** can run his entire life for him.

**00:55:47** Just like press his one button when he's streamed back

**00:55:49** and he's got an entire day planned out.

**00:55:52** And I figure just maybe if I took a tenth of what David

**00:55:55** and Rosemary do in automators, maybe I

**00:55:57** could make this a little bit easier for me.

**00:55:59** So that's just something I'm considering a little bit more.

**00:56:03** Yeah, I mean, I think that's always

**00:56:05** something that is more of the dream than the promise.

**00:56:10** I'm really resistant to jankiness.

**00:56:13** Yeah, like this is the issue of,

**00:56:16** I feel like critical skills for becoming good at automating

**00:56:19** things are also identifying what actually is automatable.

**00:56:26** In most normal circumstances for normal jobs,

**00:56:30** the number of things that are actually automatable

**00:56:33** is unfortunately smaller than you initially think it is.

**00:56:37** Because you do run into this issue of computers

**00:56:41** need things exactly the same every time.

**00:56:45** And you just don't realize how many tasks aren't literally

**00:56:49** exactly the same every time.

**00:56:51** And if you have to start building in like a decision

**00:56:53** tree into your automation, you very quickly run into the like,

**00:56:57** this is not actually helping.

**00:56:58** Like now I'm just spending time building

**00:57:00** some weird janky system that's going to fall apart the moment

**00:57:03** that I go through with it.

**00:57:05** I'm not meaning to dissuade you there,

**00:57:06** but it is one of these things of like.

**00:57:08** I know what I'm willing to accept of this stuff.

**00:57:10** And like, there are a lot of things

**00:57:12** that are like automatable.

**00:57:14** Like, you know, a lot of people use tools

**00:57:15** like keyboard maestro, which is a great Mac app.

**00:57:18** I think you use it for some stuff.

**00:57:20** And some of the stuff that keyboard maestro can do is like,

**00:57:22** oh, we can place your windows for you and move them around.

**00:57:25** But what I don't like about it is you see the computer doing it.

**00:57:28** And I do not like that at all.

**00:57:29** Why don't you like that?

**00:57:30** Because that's so satisfying.

**00:57:31** No, I hate it.

**00:57:32** I hate like pressing a button and then like everything's like moving piece

**00:57:36** by piece in front of you.

**00:57:37** It just feels like to me, I accidentally bumped the mouse.

**00:57:41** I've deleted my entire hard drive.

**00:57:44** You know, like this is how these things make me feel.

**00:57:46** So like I tend not to tool around with them too much.

**00:57:50** So this is kind of like I'm pretty hesitant to things that.

**00:57:53** It's why I like shortcuts, honestly, because.

**00:57:58** It's doing things in like an approved way.

**00:58:03** And not doing things in a weird way.

**00:58:06** It's like why I've really gravitated towards shortcuts.

**00:58:08** And like, don't get me wrong.

**00:58:10** It has its own jankiness, but it's like agreed upon jankiness

**00:58:15** with something that keyboard maestro like at the moment

**00:58:18** where an app is pretending to be my mouse.

**00:58:21** I'm like, I don't know, man, that doesn't feel right.

**00:58:25** I'm not sure if you're supposed to be allowed to do this.

**00:58:28** And so like that, I kind of feel like I can draw a line of it sometimes.

**00:58:32** But I know that these tools can also just be used to run scripts and stuff.

**00:58:36** And I'm cool with that.

**00:58:37** And so I don't know, I'm playing around.

**00:58:41** Everyone's using stream decks these days.

**00:58:43** And I broke out my old stream deck and I put some shortcuts on it and stuff.

**00:58:46** And I don't know, I'm going to something that I've just got in my mind,

**00:58:50** but I have no idea what that means yet.

**00:58:52** So you don't like watching the computer do stuff for you.

**00:58:54** So presumably you don't suffer from progress bar disease

**00:58:58** where you just can watch a progress bar complete.

**00:59:01** And it's like, wow, that was a satisfying experience.

**00:59:04** Wait, is this the thing that you enjoy?

**00:59:08** I literally have to tell myself sometimes, hey,

**00:59:11** you can't just watch this progress bar complete.

**00:59:13** I will totally zone out and just watch a very slow progress bar complete.

**00:59:17** And it's like, wow, that was great.

**00:59:18** Jeez.

**00:59:19** No, no, don't do that, dude.

**00:59:21** That's a terrible use of your time.

**00:59:22** If you want to know where your taste in video games comes from,

**00:59:25** I think I found it.

**00:59:27** My God.

**00:59:30** I will do literally anything else and watch the progress bar.

**00:59:35** I want to do literally anything else, but I constantly have to remind myself.

**00:59:39** Don't do that.

**00:59:40** It's like when you load a bunch of footage into Final Cut,

**00:59:43** it creates like 100 progress bars, each of which are the program transcoding

**00:59:48** the clips that you've just loaded in.

**00:59:49** I have to make sure I walk away from the computer

**00:59:51** because I'll just watch every single one of them complete.

**00:59:53** It's like Christmas.

**00:59:54** Yeah, it's like that's the worst use of your time ever.

**00:59:56** You know, this is literally what the computer is supposed to do.

**00:59:59** It does this and you don't have to sit here.

**01:00:02** So that's why it's just funny to me.

**01:00:03** It's like, oh, watching Keyboard Maestro move stuff around

**01:00:05** is the most satisfying, but Mike hates it.

**01:00:08** It's funny, like, because with the progress bar thing, it's like,

**01:00:11** I would understand that more if like you couldn't do anything else

**01:00:14** on your computer at that moment.

**01:00:16** But you could just, any other app, anything else,

**01:00:19** you could just select any of them and do anything else.

**01:00:22** Yeah, but it's hard. It's hard to look away.

**01:00:25** Turns out it's like, oh, wow. 13%, 14%.

**01:02:18** How's your year theme going so far?

**01:02:21** I'm worried about your theme, Gray.

**01:02:23** I'm not going to lie, but thinking about it.

**01:02:24** Oh, yeah? Why are you worried?

**01:02:25** It's OK. It's interesting.

**01:02:26** Yeah, I'm worried. It's too big.

**01:02:29** I totally get that. I totally get that.

**01:02:31** Because it's like I'm thinking about mine, right?

**01:02:33** And I'm like 20 days into the year and I've just spoke for 15 minutes

**01:02:37** about all the stuff.

**01:02:38** And then I'm like, how is your new decade dawn theme going?

**01:02:43** It's like if we're looking at the decade, it's like a minuscule percentage

**01:02:48** if it's completed so far.

**01:02:50** Yeah, so I'm actually looking at it.

**01:02:51** I'm looking at it in a little bit of a different way of that.

**01:02:55** Like I'm not trying to.

**01:02:57** The framing isn't like, oh, what percentage are we through the decade?

**01:03:00** Right. Like I need one of those like that horrible Twitter account of percent of year

**01:03:04** complete and it's like, goddamn, I hate to.

**01:03:06** We went through this before.

**01:03:07** We ended up finding the app.

**01:03:08** Yeah. And which I mean to install on my computer.

**01:03:12** And then after the show, I was like, you know what? Don't do that.

**01:03:15** No, we just realized I wish you would have known this at the time.

**01:03:18** You would have just stared at that app for the rest of your life.

**01:03:21** Yeah, that's why I haven't installed that, right?

**01:03:24** Well, haven't agree when he found this.

**01:03:27** He found this application that could tell him 70 years into the future

**01:03:31** and he just couldn't break his attention from it.

**01:03:34** So, yeah, I'm not thinking of like a progress bar filling in the decade.

**01:03:37** Like I'm not I'm really not thinking about it in that way.

**01:03:40** The reason I pause there is just getting like last time,

**01:03:44** I feel like I'm in the middle of something.

**01:03:45** And I actually feel like we're in fairly similar places.

**01:03:50** And part of this is just it's interesting.

**01:03:54** Like I still feel like I'm coming out of the like feeling quite tapped out phase

**01:03:59** that I discussed last time.

**01:04:01** Like I can I can feel that that's not quite over

**01:04:04** as I've tried to reboot some video projects.

**01:04:06** But it's been it's been one of those times where.

**01:04:10** It's very hard to point at something specific and actionable,

**01:04:17** but I really feel like my brain has been turning over quite intensely.

**01:04:23** Thoughts about my YouTube channel and the way that I make videos all month.

**01:04:31** Like I feel like some some part of my brain is really busy on this.

**01:04:36** And the reason why I'm not concerned about the theme being like new decades

**01:04:43** dawn is I feel like it actually gives me a bunch of space to feel, hey,

**01:04:49** think about what this means for a while.

**01:04:53** And I have a bunch of thoughts about the way I want to do

**01:04:57** videos in the future that are that are forming out of this.

**01:05:01** And this is one of those cases where it's like I don't really want to get

**01:05:03** into the specifics of of what I'm thinking, because I think that's

**01:05:07** that is a kind of like jinx yourself.

**01:05:08** Or it's just I don't like talking about the way some of that stuff works.

**01:05:12** We'll get to it. Right.

**01:05:13** Like if you do any of these things, we'll get to it.

**01:05:16** Yeah. Right. Yeah.

**01:05:18** Yeah. Like I can have I can have thoughts about videos in the future

**01:05:21** which sort of express how I'm thinking about things.

**01:05:23** But yeah, so it's it's been like it's just been this really weird

**01:05:27** interesting time where I feel like, oh, my last actual video was the

**01:05:32** Someone Dead Ruined My Life video.

**01:05:33** And I've just been churning over like, OK, what does what does the next

**01:05:38** 10 years mean for me?

**01:05:41** And I'm actually I'm actually quite fine with spending a bunch of time on this.

**01:05:46** And like it does feel that the long term horizon for this theme.

**01:05:53** It feels like it's created space for me to take some time

**01:05:56** and think about this.

**01:05:58** And I mentioned it kind of offhandedly last time about YouTube being this funny

**01:06:03** career where unlike the rest of the entertainment industry,

**01:06:08** there aren't season breaks as there are between TV shows

**01:06:12** or the sort of downtime between projects that's normally built into things

**01:06:16** like YouTube is, hey, you can upload at any moment.

**01:06:20** So you should always be uploading.

**01:06:22** And just thinking about this concept of trying to have

**01:06:26** something like what the traditional entertainment industry has done forever.

**01:06:30** I think the timing has just worked out great that, hey, you know,

**01:06:33** it's the worst year of the month to upload anything to YouTube by a huge margin.

**01:06:39** It's January.

**01:06:41** So I'm also kind of happy just continuing to mull over stuff

**01:06:46** and not feeling a huge amount of pressure right now, because

**01:06:50** if there's going to be any time that makes sense as a natural season break,

**01:06:55** it is January because it is just terrible on YouTube during this time.

**01:07:00** And then it slowly gets better as the year goes on.

**01:07:03** So my rough plan is that I need to set up for myself

**01:07:09** a great occasion to get back into like working on the next video.

**01:07:14** But I just I haven't quite settled on where and when that's going to be.

**01:07:18** So, yeah, I know it's just a funny place.

**01:07:21** I do not have lots of specifics to talk about while I still I feel like I've been

**01:07:25** thinking about it quite a lot.

**01:07:26** And I'm actually I'm actually totally happy with that.

**01:07:29** It's cool that state.

**01:07:30** I'm pleased to hear.

**01:07:31** I think, you know, for me, the way I was concerned about your theme is,

**01:07:35** you know, I have come to the conclusion that I very poorly named my

**01:07:40** 2021 theme and made it this like albatross, honestly, like with its size.

**01:07:48** And as we went through in the last episode

**01:07:50** and since I felt so much better about it after we spoke about it,

**01:07:54** because I realized I had actually done what I wanted to do.

**01:07:57** But when I kept thinking about reinvention, it was just too much, you know,

**01:08:01** like I just couldn't reinvention was just a silly name.

**01:08:06** And so and I feel like really my my mood towards my theme was down on the fact

**01:08:11** that I felt like I was could never achieve this thing.

**01:08:15** And obviously, if you're only going to do this for a year or maybe two years

**01:08:19** to have this theme, you know, as you sometimes would do, it's still not a decade.

**01:08:24** Mm hmm. You know, so that that was just like the thing that I was

**01:08:27** just concerned about.

**01:08:28** But I get you are coming to it from the place that I ended up

**01:08:32** realizing I should have where it's like, no, this isn't about

**01:08:36** in this 12 month period, I would have been reinvented.

**01:08:40** It's giving myself the foundation to do that.

**01:08:43** Yeah. Moving on.

**01:08:45** Yeah. I mean, you know this now, which is great.

**01:08:47** But I I just wanted to talk about that.

**01:08:50** Yeah. And I think it is funny that last time we just commented on how like, oh,

**01:08:56** foundation is such a great name for a theme.

**01:08:59** But I think we are both doing what are actually quite foundational themes this year.

**01:09:04** Like you're laying a bunch of foundations for next year.

**01:09:07** And I feel like I'm basically doing the same thing.

**01:09:10** I think we have weirdly landed in a very similar space,

**01:09:14** which is we have both been doing this stuff that we do for 10 years.

**01:09:19** I've only been professional for half of that time, but I've been doing it

**01:09:23** for that amount of time.

**01:09:24** And we're both thinking about like we've we've hit like for different reasons.

**01:09:31** Almost a point where it's like, OK, I can do this thing or I know how to do this thing,

**01:09:36** but I want to do it a bit differently or I want to focus on something else as well.

**01:09:41** What does it take to do that and move forward from here?

**01:09:45** And so like I think it's interesting to me that we were commenting

**01:09:49** this from very different places, but I think that there is an undercurrent,

**01:09:52** which is which is pretty similar right now.

**01:09:54** Oh, yeah, totally.

**01:09:55** I mean, probably helped by the fact that we started a company together.

**01:09:59** That might do it.

**01:10:00** I do think that also contributes to it because having a new company

**01:10:05** that's a project together also sharpens your focus

**01:10:09** about the other things that you're doing just simply by being a comparison.

**01:10:12** So, yeah, I think that is partly why we might be in similar places.

**01:10:16** And yeah, for me, like I said, it's it's it's really interesting

**01:10:19** just trying to think a lot about, like I said last time, how YouTube has changed

**01:10:26** and what it is that I want to continue to do, like

**01:10:31** accepting the reality of those changes and not being a giant baby

**01:10:35** about like, oh, I don't like the things that are different.

**01:10:38** And yeah, I know it's it's been interesting.

**01:10:39** I've taken time this month to talk to a bunch of people who are like

**01:10:44** colleagues in this space.

**01:10:46** And yeah, so it's it has been time very well used.

**01:10:51** Like I've had a bunch of interesting conversations and getting

**01:10:53** like different people's takes on like, what do you feel like

**01:10:57** the business is like now and what are you doing?

**01:10:59** All of this is kind of informing a bunch of my thoughts

**01:11:03** about what will happen in the future.

**01:11:05** I know some people saying about that, that they were like

**01:11:08** worried that you were there only safe space on YouTube.

**01:11:11** What? Like I was seeing people talk about this of like, oh, I, you know,

**01:11:16** what I loved about Gray is that he didn't pay attention to these things.

**01:11:21** Oh, it's interesting.

**01:11:21** I actually I actually didn't see any comments like that.

**01:11:25** Yeah, so I know.

**01:11:25** I think that's that's a totally fair question.

**01:11:27** And it's like there was a concern that like you were now going to go

**01:11:31** to like the quote unquote dark side of YouTube.

**01:11:34** And like focus on the algorithm, making sure you clickbait and like,

**01:11:38** you know, all the things that would worry you.

**01:11:42** Well, like previously before, what I think fans of your content have known

**01:11:46** is like, Gray is going to make what Gray wants to make.

**01:11:50** And as a fan of Gray and his opinion and his outlook,

**01:11:54** I am going to just like that rather than they're feeling like

**01:11:59** Gray is going to make what the algorithm is encouraging him to do.

**01:12:05** Yeah, oh, I totally get that as a concern.

**01:12:07** And I think this this is like, what have I been thinking about?

**01:12:12** And so one of one of the areas where I think it makes

**01:12:17** sense to make concessions is like with the titles

**01:12:22** and with the thumbnails as well, like that's one area where I think, OK,

**01:12:27** I don't love thinking about titles and thumbnails, but trying to do more of that.

**01:12:32** Also,

**01:12:35** bugging my team for every title suggestion under the sun

**01:12:39** and having my poor animator come up with like 10 different thumbnails to try.

**01:12:44** Can I just say on that you ask me like probably the worst question

**01:12:47** anyone's ever asked me in my life recently.

**01:12:49** Oh, did I? What would I ask you? Which was that.

**01:12:52** So you put together a video about the theme system journal.

**01:12:56** Uh huh. Which I think I want to talk about some of the process of that in more text today.

**01:13:00** We haven't got time to talk about today. OK. Go to get more text.com.

**01:13:04** All of this and more text. That's where you go.

**01:13:06** But you said to me at one point, give me as many title suggestions as you have.

**01:13:10** And I was like, I don't know how to do this.

**01:13:13** And I was trying to say stuff and they were all shit.

**01:13:16** Every single one of them. And I knew it.

**01:13:18** But I felt like I had to contribute because we were like

**01:13:21** really trying to get this video posted.

**01:13:24** And I'm like, well, let me just try and say some.

**01:13:26** And they were so bad.

**01:13:28** But it was like, I feel like I got to say something.

**01:13:32** Oh, it was terrible. Never ask me that question again.

**01:13:34** Oh, right. Yeah. But you also see like how surprisingly hard it is.

**01:13:38** So hard. I mean, look, that's why we title the episodes of our shows

**01:13:44** the way that we do, which is by and large, either from a very strict format of like

**01:13:49** state of the art, like, you know, in just a year or it's something funny.

**01:13:53** One of us said in the episode, because trying to descriptively name something.

**01:13:59** I can't do it. Like I can never come up with things that are interesting

**01:14:03** or in all like enlightening in any real way.

**01:14:07** And one of the big problems with trying to come up with titles

**01:14:11** is and I think this is why you also experienced like, oh, my God, this is so hard,

**01:14:15** is you naturally have something that comes to your mind

**01:14:18** and it just pushes everything else out.

**01:14:22** It's it becomes very hard to not think of things that are just

**01:14:27** variations on the concept that you already have in your head.

**01:14:31** And like, that's not actually what you need.

**01:14:32** You need things that are legit different, like totally different takes

**01:14:36** on what the title is with a couple of colleagues.

**01:14:39** Someone was trying to name something important.

**01:14:41** And I was helping a couple of people out in like a big brainstorm session.

**01:14:45** And it's like brutal. All right.

**01:14:47** And this was a case of, oh, we're a group of professionals.

**01:14:51** Trying to title something and the just pure minutes of silence

**01:14:57** on a joint FaceTime call as we're all looking to the ceiling,

**01:15:00** trying to like throw out different ideas is very hard.

**01:15:04** There are no bad suggestions except all of the bad ones

**01:15:07** that you're all going to give and judge each other about.

**01:15:10** Yeah, yeah, totally.

**01:15:12** It's like, wait a second.

**01:15:14** How many subscribers does this guy have?

**01:15:16** Is it the best he can do?

**01:15:18** Yeah. And it's it's amazing like how tough it is.

**01:15:21** But so to feed into that, this is this is one of these things

**01:15:24** where accepting the realities of the way YouTube works,

**01:15:28** it does make sense to spend more time on this really unpleasant task

**01:15:33** of trying to just come up with a larger list of titles.

**01:15:38** And I think one of the thoughts I have is like, OK,

**01:15:41** trying to come up with better titles is good.

**01:15:44** But I still feel like the thing that I just can't live with

**01:15:49** is titles that spoil the most interesting thing about the video

**01:15:53** or where it's like, I feel that that title makes the video worse in some way.

**01:15:57** And for me, like the canonical example of this is metric paper,

**01:16:01** where my title, like metric paper and everything in the universe

**01:16:06** 100 percent performs better as a title.

**01:16:11** But I did decide to change it back to metric paper,

**01:16:14** because I think the experience of watching that video

**01:16:18** without knowing that something else is coming is a way better experience.

**01:16:24** And so this is where it's like I think people overestimate

**01:16:28** that when you like consider something, they think it's a larger factor

**01:16:32** than it necessarily is.

**01:16:34** And so this is one of those cases where it's like, oh, I changed the title.

**01:16:37** This title performs better. YouTube likes it better.

**01:16:41** But I just think it makes the video worse.

**01:16:43** And even though from a pure spreadsheet perspective,

**01:16:48** the better performing title that spoils that something is coming

**01:16:52** will get this video more views.

**01:16:54** I do think there's some intangible quality

**01:16:58** of the kind of people who like my stuff

**01:17:01** will experience this video better with the less descriptive title.

**01:17:06** So it's not like I'm just 100 percent running an A.B.

**01:17:10** test on all of the titles and just going with whatever is the best title

**01:17:14** that YouTube likes.

**01:19:06** I thanks to Squarespace for the continued support of Cortex and Relay FM.

**01:19:11** But thinking about content that's produced,

**01:19:15** I think one of the things I've been thinking about a lot in the modern

**01:19:20** entertainment industry is as I think I think that there's there's something like

**01:19:26** in economics, there is sometimes this concept of where like the middle

**01:19:31** gets cut out of products.

**01:19:34** And I do think this is something that you see in the modern world

**01:19:37** increasing in a lot of product areas.

**01:19:40** Where whatever it is, it's like a physical object like a chair.

**01:19:44** It's very easy to buy a super cheap chair

**01:19:48** and you can find very expensive, very nice chairs.

**01:19:52** But over time, chairs that are in the middle are increasingly difficult to find.

**01:19:57** And that happens because you just sort of get economically pushed towards

**01:20:03** it makes sense to make chairs at scale cheaply.

**01:20:08** And it makes sense to make chairs for people who really care about chairs

**01:20:12** and are willing to spend a lot.

**01:20:15** But there's actually as your options increase,

**01:20:18** weirdly, there are fewer people who want chairs that are somewhere in the middle.

**01:20:22** And I think there's something like that that's kind of happening in the

**01:20:26** entertainment industry and the online video world as well,

**01:20:30** where I don't mean this in terms of length, but I mean this in terms of content of like

**01:20:36** the stuff that's in the middle, it misses the mark.

**01:20:41** And that's kind of something that's been on my mind.

**01:20:43** Like one of the thoughts I've had is the like that last video I did about the Tesla Road Trip.

**01:20:50** I feel like that actually ended up being a video that is a good example of a video

**01:20:55** that's in the middle.

**01:20:57** Was that video a vlog about my trip?

**01:21:02** No, it wasn't a vlog about my trip.

**01:21:05** Was that video a video about the details of the like current state of the Tesla autopilot system?

**01:21:13** No, it wasn't.

**01:21:14** It wasn't really that either.

**01:21:15** And so unlike when I look at a video like my sharks video, which I really like,

**01:21:20** which is like, boy, hey, you want to know about these shark statues?

**01:21:24** This is like the video about these shark statues.

**01:21:27** Everything you could ever want to know.

**01:21:29** Right. Everything you could ever want to know. Right.

**01:21:32** Right. And so like that last

**01:21:34** video of mine for various reasons, like I did want to get it out as fast as I could.

**01:21:38** I made a bunch of decisions about it.

**01:21:40** I was very aware of of like I've got a couple of options of the way to go with this one.

**01:21:45** And that one to me, like it just misses the mark and it misses the mark because

**01:21:51** it's this middle product.

**01:21:54** It's sort of a vlog, but not really.

**01:21:58** And it's sort of some information about the Tesla autopilot system, but not really.

**01:22:04** And I think it would have been a better video if it was more of one or the other.

**01:22:11** And I was aware of that when I was making it.

**01:22:13** But I did make a decision of like, I want to get this out relatively fast because this is

**01:22:17** kind of time sensitive because it is related to the current state of what the technology was.

**01:22:22** So this, again, is like one of those.

**01:22:24** I made the decision I made at the time with the information I did.

**01:22:27** And that was fine, even though now I think like I would do that differently if I was going to do that again.

**01:22:32** But one of the qualities that I just think about is young me wouldn't have loved that video.

**01:22:41** And that's like, oh, well, don't make videos like that.

**01:22:44** Right. I've mentioned a number of times like going forward thinking about what am I going to do for the channel?

**01:22:50** Like I want to try to do more of the great goes outside kind of stuff.

**01:22:54** And I still have not for the life of me figured out what is going to work here with that.

**01:22:59** But this is one of those sorts of areas where I think just make sure you're actually making a video that younger you would have enjoyed.

**01:23:09** And this is like a key metric that has always served you well.

**01:23:13** And when I say things about like accepting the realities of the way YouTube works now, I totally understand why people

**01:23:22** worry about like, oh, you're going to do more clickbait.

**01:23:25** But it's not actually the way that my thinking is going.

**01:23:29** It's much more like it's along these lines of like there's missing middles and YouTube rewards videos that are the most version of whatever they are.

**01:23:42** And oh, there's a way that I can make videos like that, which is what are the videos that are the most version?

**01:23:52** Of what younger me would have wanted to watch on YouTube.

**01:23:57** This is partly what I mean, by the way, my thoughts are like bubbling up around a thing.

**01:24:01** I don't know if I'm expressing this very well at all, but like this is what's on my mind.

**01:24:05** I want to see if I can try and tease that out a little bit.

**01:24:08** Can you with that Tesla self driving video?

**01:24:11** Let's imagine we have infinite budget time here.

**01:24:13** Can you give me an example of how that could have been more mosted?

**01:24:17** Oh, yeah, totally.

**01:24:18** So the thing that I was considering that I kept going back and forth is the alternate version of that video is the version that I think I should have mosted and actually made, which is and this was the original intention.

**01:24:33** When I did that trip, I actually had two things that I intended to film.

**01:24:38** So I wanted to film the Tesla autopilot stuff, but I also filmed another secret project, which may or may not ever see the light of day, who knows?

**01:24:47** But it was another attempt of like, Greg goes outside.

**01:24:50** And this almost always happens because I just absolutely love being able to have a thing count twice of like, this is just so in my personality of if I'm doing a trip, like I really want there to be two things.

**01:25:03** So that's partly why that happened in the infinite time version of this.

**01:25:07** What would have happened is the other thing that I went to film.

**01:25:14** Which is just like a location that I thought was interesting.

**01:25:16** It's not like something super exciting.

**01:25:18** It just thought, oh, this location has an interesting story behind it.

**01:25:20** Let me see if I can just film something about that.

**01:25:23** I would have made that video first.

**01:25:27** That would have gone out as like, I don't know, five or six minute.

**01:25:32** Greg goes outside video.

**01:25:34** And then the video that was like about the Tesla autopilot thing would have been more of a vlog about the whole trip, which now also.

**01:25:46** Has the context of, oh, hey, you know, this other video that you watched.

**01:25:51** This is the trip when that video was filmed.

**01:25:54** And also while I was doing that, I was using the Tesla autopilot the entire time, which also brings in a much broader scope of I'm going like, because oh my God, Mike, like you won't believe how much footage I have.

**01:26:08** But like, I have a ton of footage of like driving around Cherokee, North Carolina and like going to different places and like all of it is on autopilot.

**01:26:18** I'm in little towns, right?

**01:26:20** I'm on the major highways.

**01:26:21** It's night in the fog and it's terrifying.

**01:26:24** Like just have a ton of that stuff, which is in the context of trying this out.

**01:26:30** And I'm also filming something else while I'm here.

**01:26:33** That is the way to like most that other video.

**01:26:38** But this is a case where the reason I decided not to like, and this was totally my fault of the problem with the project is that every day that goes by the system changes.

**01:26:50** And so it's actually quite interesting because in that Tesla autopilot video, I talk about the left side bias.

**01:26:55** Like the system is clearly staying on the left and apparently that was totally fixed in like the next version of the software.

**01:27:03** Right.

**01:27:03** So like, this is the kind of thing where being aware like, oh, there's a time sensitive element here changes the way I have to make a decision.

**01:27:10** So I was aware that like the vlog version of this that I want to do is probably something that's a lot closer to like a 20 minute video, maybe a 30 minute video of like, here's this big trip.

**01:27:24** Here's all the details.

**01:27:25** Here's the things that I saw.

**01:27:27** Here's like a bunch of the stuff that happened.

**01:27:30** But it also have to have a video come out before then because otherwise it explains too much about like this other video.

**01:27:39** Like they have to come out in this different order.

**01:27:41** And this is one of those cases where I'm making a decision of how long is that realistically going to take me to do?

**01:27:48** It's going to be several months.

**01:27:51** You know, like if my previous videos are anything to go by, it's going to take a while.

**01:27:56** There's a ton of footage going through all that footage is extremely time consuming.

**01:28:01** And so I kind of made the call of I'm not going to do that because if I do that, who knows how outdated everything I'm talking about is going to be by the time that it's done.

**01:28:12** So this is where it's like, okay, I ended up making a video that was sort of in the middle of these things.

**01:28:19** And it's like, it just doesn't hit like it's interesting.

**01:28:22** It doesn't hit for me.

**01:28:24** Like I'm kind of say I'm happy with the way it came out.

**01:28:27** I think stylistically it's the best version of that kind of video that I could make.

**01:28:32** But it's not the maximum on some quality.

**01:28:37** So that is the alternate universe in where a different video was made.

**01:28:41** So in like this era of most videos, would you just not make that Tesla video then?

**01:28:48** Yeah.

**01:28:48** So like I've been thinking a lot about that project and this is funny.

**01:28:52** This has actually been an explicit instruction that I've, I've given to the people I work with, which is, Hey, next time I suggest any kind of project that has not just a deadline, but has an implied deadline.

**01:29:11** You need to tell me not to do that project and remind me of this moment.

**01:29:16** And I think this is one of these things where I firmly believe that deadlines are counter to quality.

**01:29:28** That like these things are always fighting each other.

**01:29:31** I would like to counterpoint you here.

**01:29:33** Yeah, go ahead.

**01:29:34** Sharks.

**01:29:35** What was it again that it was moving somewhere or doing something?

**01:29:39** And yeah, sharks had a deadline because the cat, there was, it was the date that the council said that the sharks had to move.

**01:29:45** It was worse than that because the sharks were potentially moving at any point before that deadline as well.

**01:29:50** So it was like the video needs to be out before the sharks.

**01:29:52** Because otherwise the video may have taken an infinite amount of time to be completed because it's like if you don't shut it off, right?

**01:30:01** Yeah.

**01:30:01** Where are they going to show up next?

**01:30:03** And then do you need to go film that?

**01:30:04** And then does that change?

**01:30:05** So like that would be my count.

**01:30:07** There was a deadline on that one and that was a great video.

**01:30:11** Yeah.

**01:30:12** I, this is what I'm not saying that like these things cannot coexist, right?

**01:30:17** I'm just, I'm just saying like, I think that they work against each other.

**01:30:20** And in my experience also, yes, I love sharks.

**01:30:25** I literally never want a project to be as miserable as that was again.

**01:30:29** Like it was, it was so unpleasant.

**01:30:32** Okay.

**01:30:32** So that didn't balance that one.

**01:30:34** Yeah.

**01:30:35** But I would say that that project was also like weird, like weird, right?

**01:30:40** Yes.

**01:30:40** There are a lot of reasons that project was weird.

**01:30:42** Which wasn't the time.

**01:30:43** Yeah.

**01:30:44** I guess we could put that under the category of there were a lot of things about that project that made it greatly uncertain on a number of vectors, which does not help.

**01:30:53** What I'm saying here is this is one of the reasons I think I mentioned this last time, something if I didn't, but I'm not going to be trying to track the like get your average upload time between 31 days anymore.

**01:31:05** Okay.

**01:31:05** I've made a decision that like that was very good because for the last two years, I do think I needed something to help me reboot.

**01:31:16** Hey, you need to upload to the channel more frequently.

**01:31:19** I think that was totally the correct thing to get my mind back on like, this is the main thing.

**01:31:26** Focus your time on this.

**01:31:28** And now what I find myself mulling over is, okay, cool.

**01:31:33** Like you've, you've fixed this.

**01:31:36** I think you need to get back to a different way of thinking about how you make the videos and also what context do they exist relative to other videos that exist on the YouTube platform.

**01:31:50** So I don't know if that really answers your question or if I'm even explaining myself.

**01:31:54** Well, this is what I mean.

**01:31:55** Like I feel almost like trying to explain what some part of your, your brain that you don't even know entirely what it's up to is doing.

**01:32:03** That's the way I feel right now is like I know I have the feeling of, of the shape of what's on my mind, but it's very hard to articulate in a precise manner because the process isn't really done here.

**01:32:17** Yeah.

**01:32:18** I would like, you know, just listening to what you're saying, uh, to kind of try and close somebody's brackets down.

**01:32:24** I feel like I understand what you're saying a little bit more about the most thing from the Tesla video, right?

**01:32:29** That like it didn't have enough and because it was, you know, kind of like intended to be like, here's the minimum I can do right now.

**01:32:38** That's not enough.

**01:32:39** There needs to be more than that.

**01:32:41** And as you say, right?

**01:32:42** Like part of that was because while you knew there was like a time period on it.

**01:32:45** Well, if there's a time limit on it, you should really only attack a project that has some kind of deadline.

**01:32:51** If you're confident it is like a sure fire success.

**01:32:55** Right.

**01:32:56** Like is what I assume you would feel right.

**01:32:58** Cause if you're saying like, I don't want deadlines unless I believe it's good for this project that the, you know, this is one that will have a deadline, but I really want to do it.

**01:33:07** Right.

**01:33:07** Yeah.

**01:33:07** I would, I would, I would try to re like, I think I would reframe that of if deadlines are going to exist, the project has to have much less uncertainty around it.

**01:33:19** Okay.

**01:33:19** And I think that particular with like, I've still only done, I think technically 11 gray goes outside videos, which is not very much.

**01:33:27** The question of what the hell are these videos even like is still too way uncertain for something that also had a deadline.

**01:33:35** Make that make sense.

**01:33:36** That makes sense.

**01:33:37** The one thing that I wanted to press on from what you were saying though, is like a concern that I have in hearing what you're saying that you're going to, if you're removing the 30 day thing, which I understand why, but then you're also more likely to stop a video idea.

**01:33:58** I would just have a concern that you're going to really reduce the amount that you're making.

**01:34:02** Like it feels like you are making the bar higher and removing this like internal clock.

**01:34:11** And I would be concerned that that means you're going to make like two videos in 2022.

**01:34:17** Yeah.

**01:34:17** I don't think it's going to be two videos.

**01:34:19** I'm obviously over exaggerating, but you understand what I'm saying, right?

**01:34:23** Yeah.

**01:34:23** I totally get that.

**01:34:24** I'll just say I'm aware that there need to be counterpoints and I don't quite want to go into the full details of what I'm thinking about around this, but I have some different thoughts that are around topic selection that are sort of acting as the counterpoint to this.

**01:34:41** That's cool.

**01:34:42** I mean, we can, we can, we can come up, we can talk about that later, right?

**01:34:45** Like in the same way that we spoke about the 30 day thing after you'd done that, you know, so we can, we can get to that later on.

**01:34:53** But I just, at least I'd take some kind of comfort in knowing that you would see that too, that like following these ideas too strongly without anything else going on could result in like, I can't make videos anymore because I've set these like rules for myself that now mean that like no project can be deemed surefire enough.

**01:35:16** Yeah.

**01:35:17** It's not, well, yeah.

**01:35:18** That's surefire isn't, isn't really what I'm.

**01:35:21** I feel like that's, that's a, that's a bad word for this, but yeah, I'm aware that there needs to be a counterpoint.

**01:35:26** I'm thinking about some of that in terms of topic selection, but yes, I mean, I would expect that over the, because I like this two year running average of upload frequency, I would expect that the two year running average of upload frequency.

**01:35:41** Like that decreases.

**01:35:43** I would expect that like already again, if we're counting like the last real video, even if we count it as the Tesla video, it's like, okay, we're still.

**01:35:51** Well outside that it's been 30 days since the last video marker here.

**01:35:55** So, but this is kind of why I'm also working this in with the, like the season break is fine.

**01:36:00** This is the time if I'm going to spend some time thinking about like the big picture and the metaness of how I work, this is the time to take that time and sort of plan out how do I think I'm going to tackle topics going forward.

**01:36:14** It's very funny to me.

**01:36:15** I can totally understand why people hearing me would be worried that like, gray is going to follow the algorithm, but if, if anything, it's, I don't quite want to say it's the opposite, but I do think it might be more not in that direction than, than people would expect.

**01:36:31** Yeah, it's taking what it wants, but only giving it some of it back, but it's not ignoring it.

**01:36:38** Yeah, it's not, it's not ignoring it.

**01:36:40** Because the algorithm would love it if you posted every week, at least at some level.

**01:36:44** I want to push back there because this is what I mean by some thoughts around like this missing middle.

**01:36:50** And I think if you're making videos that are in the middle posting every week, won't save you.

**01:36:55** Yeah, I didn't mean you specifically.

**01:36:59** Like it's more like if someone is able to produce more content quicker that their audience enjoys, the algorithm would love you to do that.

**01:37:09** Yeah, yeah.

**01:37:10** Obviously, this means that like if you were able to almost kill yourself, but produce a video every two weeks of good quality, the YouTube algorithm, I'm sure would reward you for that.

**01:37:23** Oh, yeah, it totally would.

**01:37:25** I guess I feel like I think I cannot over a long period of time produce a video every four weeks that also hits the marker of younger me would really like this video.

**01:37:40** I think over a long period of time, those two ideas are fundamentally opposed.

**01:37:47** Yes.

**01:37:51** We sitting in silence now.

**01:37:52** Yeah, no, I was just I was just thinking like, do I have anything else to say on this topic right now?

**01:37:58** I think that could be the end of the episode, by the way.

**01:38:01** We only got halfway through our document, but we've been going for an hour and 47 minutes.

**01:38:05** Oh, so the episode ends right now, unless people listen to more text, get more text.com.

**01:38:12** Dot com for more cortex.
