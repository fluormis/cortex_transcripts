# Cortex - 105: Atomic Notes
**00:00:00** So here we are on a completely non-regularly scheduled recording time.

**00:00:05** Yep. No schedule.

**00:00:06** Well, you say that.

**00:00:07** There was, I wish I had the audio of our last recording session where you said to me,

**00:00:15** what if we record every second Tuesday now?

**00:00:18** Because as you said at the time, you've never heard me so happy, right?

**00:00:25** Like it was kind of like a moment where it was like almost unbelievable to me to hear

**00:00:31** you suggest that we set a time on our calendar that we could, as I think I said at the time,

**00:00:37** put a repeating rule on.

**00:00:39** I mean, yes, you did sound like the happiest boy in the world and you were so happy.

**00:00:45** I found it surprising and not really quite what I was expecting because if I know if

**00:00:52** I know when we're recording, I know when the show's coming out and I can answer questions

**00:00:58** that I get and deal with administrative stuff that I need to deal with without either A,

**00:01:03** just randomly guessing or B needing to pin you down for a minute to ask you.

**00:01:09** Right. So like knowing is great, but nevertheless, our schedule was immediately broken the first time.

**00:01:17** We didn't even get to one of these scheduled recordings.

**00:01:26** Well, I mean, yeah, you are correct.

**00:01:29** What I was trying to do is solve the problem of let's have something like your mic.

**00:01:35** Let me describe to you what the advantage of schedules are.

**00:01:39** I need to know.

**00:01:40** It's so useful.

**00:01:42** It occurred to me that numerous times over the past many years is like, oh, it might be useful to have like a default recording day.

**00:01:51** That is the thing is really what I was thinking of is let's have a day that if we don't say anything,

**00:01:59** we just know is the day that is the recording day.

**00:02:03** That's what I was aiming for.

**00:02:05** And that is the real genuine like relief for me of knowing roughly when I can plan to,

**00:02:13** because there are times many times where we'll have a date that we were going to do and we move it for some reason like we did this one.

**00:02:20** And then the day before I'm like, is he remembered?

**00:02:26** Because you're not wrong.

**00:02:29** History has proven that there are many times where we had a day.

**00:02:34** We moved the day because you've got something happening and then you forget.

**00:02:38** Yeah, I think you have also developed a pretty good radar for when is Gray very busy with some self-contained project?

**00:02:48** And so like when is he extremely likely to have completely forgotten that the outside world exists?

**00:02:53** Like I think you've gotten a good sense for that over the years.

**00:02:55** So you're not you're not wrong.

**00:02:57** Honestly, the last couple of weeks have been like a real good, you know, from the time before,

**00:03:04** you put out the Gray was wrong video to now like I could I can sense when you're off the radar a little bit, right?

**00:03:12** And you know, at that time it's like fine.

**00:03:15** Like I know if something's urgent, I can flag you down, but otherwise I'm just going to like batch up my questions and we'll deal with them later on.

**00:03:22** Right. Yeah, exactly.

**00:03:23** And so when that happens, I know that there is a strong likelihood that if I can tell that you're still in that mode,

**00:03:33** I need to like really triple confirm with you that you know we're recording.

**00:03:39** Yes, yes.

**00:03:40** You're not wrong.

**00:03:41** You're not wrong at all.

**00:03:42** But yeah, so I was just been trying to do a bunch of much more longer term planning and just thinking things through.

**00:03:48** And I was like, oh, hey, what I would like for Cortex is just some like you said it exactly correctly.

**00:03:54** I was trying to think I want a repeating rule for this that can just be the default if we don't say anything else.

**00:04:00** But then you are correct that we agreed on that.

**00:04:03** And probably not.

**00:04:04** But two days later, like life exploded.

**00:04:08** And I was like, well, I'm going to be shockingly busy until this thing is done.

**00:04:12** So it didn't even occur to me when I was like, we got to move back that Cortex recording date.

**00:04:16** Like, this isn't happening.

**00:04:17** And I think the first thing you said to me is like, oh, you've already broken the schedule that you promised me instantly.

**00:04:24** We didn't even get to one.

**00:04:27** I'm so sorry, Mike.

**00:04:29** But look, I had noticed all I ever wanted is notice.

**00:04:32** You just mentioned something like I want to come back to the scheduling thing a little bit because like you are doing some interesting stuff with scheduling at the moment in your life, which is very fascinating to me.

**00:04:42** You just put up a video called Weekend Wednesday.

**00:04:44** Like you have not only you completely upended what a week looks like.

**00:04:50** So, yes, you are doing some interesting things.

**00:04:52** Yeah. Well, you're also breaking the timeline here, Mike, because I haven't put it up yet.

**00:04:55** We're recording before it goes up.

**00:04:57** You know, but we've specifically said we're going to wait.

**00:05:00** Although you've made that promise that you've made to me again a million times where it's I have a video that's coming now.

**00:05:07** Definitely coming out Tuesday.

**00:05:09** Yeah. No, 100 percent.

**00:05:11** It's coming out Tuesday, Mike.

**00:05:12** I believe that you believe it.

**00:05:14** Right. Right.

**00:05:15** Which is why when I just had to tell someone when the episode was coming out, I said most likely Wednesday.

**00:05:20** Right.

**00:05:21** Because it could be Thursday because the video might come out on Tuesday because that's also like a thing that's happened.

**00:05:27** Many times.

**00:05:28** And I'm not criticizing. Right.

**00:05:30** Like all I'm trying to prove in this discussion here is we're a good team because I know how you work.

**00:05:37** Right. It's very kind of you.

**00:05:39** Yes. Excellent.

**00:05:42** I mean, but it's, you know, yeah.

**00:05:44** People work in different ways.

**00:05:45** Like cortex is a thing that you do, but you have a much more time consuming thing that you do.

**00:05:52** Podcasts are the thing that I do like this.

**00:05:54** I can. It's all different. Right.

**00:05:55** Like, you know, it could easily be the other way around, but it's not like this is just the way that it is.

**00:06:01** And I'm more flexible in my schedule than yours can be because there are like much more dependencies.

**00:06:09** So anyway, but there was something you mentioned around you were saying about like looking at your schedule and thinking about things.

**00:06:16** It pointed to something that I've been acutely aware of right now.

**00:06:19** And then I'm referring to as being pandemic busy.

**00:06:22** OK.

**00:06:23** That I think is a could become a real problem.

**00:06:26** What do you mean by pandemic busy?

**00:06:28** Right. So I think a lot of people right now, because their lives have changed so much, they have like different demands on their time.

**00:06:35** They're using their time in different ways that people are starting to fill this time with stuff.

**00:06:42** Maybe they have a new project that they want to work on a side project or they are taking on more responsibilities in their life in some way,

**00:06:51** whether it's with work or like different family responsibilities or social responsibilities, that I'm worried that when life returns to normal,

**00:07:00** people are going to be really overwhelmed because they've taken on so many things during the pandemic that their normal lives would not allow them to do.

**00:07:13** And I'm worried that like this is this is going to become a problem for people afterwards.

**00:07:20** Like I'm also really worried about the ergonomics concern I have about people, which is that like people working from home now, we spoke about this before, not considering their ergonomics.

**00:07:29** Think that they're totally fine because it didn't start hurting immediately, but it doesn't.

**00:07:34** It takes months to like.

**00:07:36** So I feel like now we're in like the points like six months.

**00:07:39** Right. Now we're in the time when people's bodies are going to start breaking if they weren't paying attention.

**00:07:44** Yeah, that's like a whole other thing. But this is this new thing.

**00:07:47** That's a good point. Yeah, for sure.

**00:07:49** There's a lot of really wonky home office setups where you're like, oh, yeah, this this stool and this card table is perfectly acceptable for me to work on.

**00:07:57** And then six months later, like, why is my back hurt so much?

**00:08:00** Exactly. Like, oh, I can just like stare down at my laptop the whole time.

**00:08:04** I don't need to elevate and get an external keyboard.

**00:08:06** Like, that's something I need. No, that's something you definitely need.

**00:08:09** OK, so so yeah, so pandemic busy.

**00:08:12** What I thought you meant by this is like, oh, people are just filling up their time with make work, you know, because they've they've got nothing to do.

**00:08:17** But so so this is it's actually a good point.

**00:08:20** So what's that rule?

**00:08:22** Like, you know, work expands to fill the time that you have or something like it feels like this is a variation on people always have a certain number of projects or obligations in their life.

**00:08:34** And so like you so you think people are filling back up to whatever.

**00:08:39** Their personal level of like, this is the optimal number of projects that I want to work on.

**00:08:43** They're filling up to whatever that is without considering the fact that they're going to need a lot more slack in the system when if real life returns back and comes in with like, oh, hey, remember commutes.

**00:08:57** Remember all the office stuff that you have to deal with.

**00:09:00** Remember social obligations.

**00:09:02** So that's what you're concerned about is like people are loading up and it's going to be like system shock later.

**00:09:09** It's a really interesting point.

**00:09:10** That's a really interesting point.

**00:09:11** This goes into my personal theory, which like where I am right now in my life is believing things will go back to normal, but it's going to be a long time.

**00:09:21** Like that's where I am right now.

**00:09:23** Right.

**00:09:23** Where it's like I believe there will be a restored sense of normality in our future, but it's still a way away.

**00:09:30** Like it's still at least a year away.

**00:09:33** Right.

**00:09:33** Like that's kind of where I am right now.

**00:09:36** And, you know, like we can argue the specifics, but basically the idea of like we don't think about lockdowns anymore.

**00:09:44** Right.

**00:09:44** It's like a thing in our lives.

**00:09:45** And, you know, like we start thinking about like, oh, we should work in offices.

**00:09:49** Now, there is a whole other question, which I do want to get into more at some point in the future, where I believe the office work is just going to change because of the economics of it, not because of the disease, not because of the virus.

**00:10:01** Right.

**00:10:01** So like there's a lot of companies now that are like, holy, we're saving millions.

**00:10:06** Right.

**00:10:07** Why the hell do we have these offices?

**00:10:09** Right.

**00:10:09** And so like I don't believe all corporate real estate will go away, but I think significant chunks of it will because there are always jobs that people work better in person or there are always situations where like there are people that can't work comfortably at home.

**00:10:22** It's not easy for them.

**00:10:24** Like they don't like it and it's good to have options.

**00:10:26** But I can imagine a situation where lots of big companies have maybe 50 percent of the office space that they have before.

**00:10:33** So like that's like a thing that I think there will be changes.

**00:10:37** But the idea of like the way people live their lives, like I think it will return to a sense of normality, but we're still a way away from it, which is why this thing is concerning to me of like we still got a long time to go.

**00:10:49** People don't want to be bored.

**00:10:51** People don't want to be sitting around doing nothing and or people see this as a time of like, look at this extra time I have.

**00:10:57** I have this project that I've always wanted to do.

**00:10:59** I've now saved two hours of my day every single day through not needing to commute.

**00:11:04** I can finally do that thing.

**00:11:06** And then they get used to that thing being in their life and then they need those two hours back.

**00:11:10** Like it's just like a and this isn't me saying like don't do the thing, right?

**00:11:15** Because obviously we care like deeply on this show about people having projects.

**00:11:19** Right. Yeah.

**00:11:20** But I think it's something that we need to keep in mind.

**00:11:25** It started for me because for many reasons, some that we'll go into during this episode, I am in a very busy time right now.

**00:11:33** And it's just been a thing where I've thought, huh, I feel busy again.

**00:11:38** Why?

**00:11:39** And so, like, I've come to the conclusion that the stuff that I'm working on is short term and I would have just felt more busy and I currently do.

**00:11:47** But it's about I'm I'm I'm trying to not fall into the trap of I have a bit of extra time free.

**00:11:53** It's time to start a new podcast.

**00:11:55** OK, yeah, yeah, yeah.

**00:11:56** Because I mean, at least from what I know about your upcoming schedule, it does strike me that like, oh, yes, this is just a busy time as there are busy times.

**00:12:05** So you don't think that there's anything in your personal life right now that you would identify as like, oh, no, this is a pandemic busy project.

**00:12:11** No, OK. There's like some social things have changed.

**00:12:15** But I think that they will just get replaced.

**00:12:18** But it's just a case of like looking around at the people in my life and looking at people like I see online and stuff.

**00:12:25** And it's like, hmm, it's just been like a little sexist time that it's just been bubbling around in my brain a little bit that I think I want to return to.

**00:12:34** At some point in the future.

**00:12:36** But I wanted to like float it by you to see if it like helped.

**00:12:40** I keep hearing people say like, oh, because of the pandemic, I'm like trying out this new hobby or whatever, which is awesome.

**00:12:46** Great use of your time.

**00:12:48** But my concern is that there will then be a sense of overwhelm later.

**00:12:54** Yeah, I think I think you might be right.

**00:12:56** I'm just I'm just sort of mentally filing through all the like the cards in my head for the projects and things like that.

**00:13:01** I don't feel like there's anything for me that really sticks out as that.

**00:13:05** But the idea still feels pretty valid, though, like, oh, this is totally going to be a thing.

**00:13:10** Because so like you were saying, I think it was in your Q&A video that you put just put up slash are going to put up have will put up have will that you had a bunch of stuff on your calendar.

**00:13:20** Right. Which obviously got cleared off.

**00:13:22** But it's not like you're now not doing anything.

**00:13:26** Yeah, yeah. Right.

**00:13:27** So you are filling it with other things.

**00:13:31** And then it's just the question of is this the less or more or could I potentially go through this time and have come up with a really great idea that later on means way more work when I can go back to doing those projects again?

**00:13:45** Hmm. I mean, part of why I originally suggested like, let's have a default cortex recording day, even if it gets moved and talking about projects is I was aware suddenly of, oh,

**00:13:57** I need to really seriously sit down and plan and think about the order of a bunch of things that I was thinking I was going to work on.

**00:14:06** Like we've been long enough that I've recognized, oh, a bunch of these projects, they're not temporarily on hold and I'll get to them in a month.

**00:14:16** It's more like, OK, assume these projects simply cannot be done or cannot be finished.

**00:14:21** And if that's the case, you need to rethink in a really vague way, what does the rest of the year of videos look like?

**00:14:29** Like, which topics are you going to do or that kind of thing?

**00:14:31** So that's why I was in like a scheduling mood and thinking about it.

**00:14:35** It doesn't strike me as pandemic busy because this is always a thing that I do is is I don't even this is not like any target that I try to stick to.

**00:14:44** It's just the vague concept of what are the next four to six most probable main videos that are coming up?

**00:14:53** It's just like a useful thing to think about.

**00:14:55** But you could see, I guess, if somebody thought like you a little like enough, someone work you enough like that they could be planning out their next six videos and then the travel starts again.

**00:15:05** So that's all that they were working on before.

**00:15:07** And now also in the hopper.

**00:15:09** Yes, exactly.

**00:15:11** That the only thing that makes it different for me is that because of the way I structure my whole life, I'm able to then just push back and like rearrange all of those projects.

**00:15:20** But yes, like most people in most working situations, projects come with more clear and direct external dependencies and obligations.

**00:15:29** And so, yes, I can totally see that you can very easily work yourself into way too many obligations that like just cannot possibly fit into a normal person's life.

**00:15:41** Once a normal person's life returns.

**00:15:43** So, yeah, I think it's a really valid concept.

**00:15:46** And I think you're right to, I don't know, maybe this feels like the real danger zone time for this of people having pandemic projects and taking on more like right now.

**00:15:56** And then also, you know, real life returning maybe at some point on the horizon.

**00:16:00** Yeah, I think it's interesting.

**00:16:02** Because I don't know about you, but like I feel like this is life now.

**00:16:06** Yeah, yeah, I do.

**00:16:08** I feel like I'm I've adapted.

**00:16:09** And it doesn't mean that I'm taking my eye off the ball.

**00:16:13** What it means is like we have our flow now.

**00:16:17** We know how we operate in life.

**00:16:21** And so I think it's the time it could for a lot of people where they were like, all right, this is what I'm used to for now.

**00:16:29** So what changes?

**00:16:30** Right?

**00:16:31** Like maybe people were spending like time reassessing.

**00:16:34** I like your weekend Wednesday idea, by the way.

**00:16:37** I wished it was something that I could easily implement, but I have a lot of like scheduled projects on Wednesdays.

**00:16:42** Right.

**00:16:43** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**00:16:44** No, no, no need to move.

**00:16:45** But similarly, though, I do always try to keep Thursday or Friday in a week pretty open so I can have a backup weekend day.

**00:16:58** That happened with this very week.

**00:17:00** That happened with this very week.

**00:17:02** So I kept pretty much most of yesterday free because we're working today.

**00:17:07** Right.

**00:17:08** Right.

**00:17:08** Which is a Saturday.

**00:17:09** Yeah, I mean, the weekend Wednesday thing for me is directly related to quarantine.

**00:17:15** And the evolution of the thought starts with a conversation you and I had at the very beginning of this whole thing where you were talking about taking the weekend really seriously.

**00:17:25** This was part of the whole like, what day is it?

**00:17:28** What month is it?

**00:17:28** I have no idea.

**00:17:29** Right.

**00:17:30** You like you lose sense of time.

**00:17:31** Do I need a giant sign in my house that says Saturday?

**00:17:34** Right.

**00:17:35** I thought that was there was a really good point about take the weekends seriously.

**00:17:40** This is now a vital thing.

**00:17:42** And it's also something I think just generally over the past many years of my working in my life, I've never really taken the weekends seriously.

**00:17:51** You know, this is always the problem of being a self-employed person is, you know, you can you can just very easily end up always.

**00:17:59** Working or half working, which is even worse.

**00:18:02** So I totally like I was like, Oh yeah, you're you're 100% right.

**00:18:05** Like keeping psychological distance between days on and days off is a thousand times more important now in the same way that like exercise is mandatory.

**00:18:16** It doesn't matter what you think about it.

**00:18:17** Like you have to do this now, but it started this thought process because I've always like whoever came up with the seven day week is the worst number.

**00:18:27** The seven day week is like incredibly frustrating.

**00:18:29** It's a prime number.

**00:18:31** It doesn't divide easily.

**00:18:32** I don't like it.

**00:18:33** Two thumbs down to the inventor of the seven day week.

**00:18:37** I found myself like taking the weekend seriously, but getting increasingly annoyed by the amount of time is just wrong.

**00:18:43** And I've tried to come up with various schemes for could I have a 12 day week that overlaps with the seven day week?

**00:18:51** You said this is this is the thing that you are not allowed to keep doing.

**00:18:56** I'll just change time.

**00:18:59** I'll live on a different time zone that you can't just keep trying to do these things.

**00:19:05** What do you mean?

**00:19:08** I live on a different time zone and my week lasts 12 and a half days.

**00:19:12** Well, okay.

**00:19:13** But so here's, you know, the problem is that the external world exists.

**00:19:17** Right.

**00:19:17** And so you can have these like these great patterns where you have some very old calendars do this kind of thing where it's like, oh, we have three cycles.

**00:19:24** There's a three day cycle and a nine day cycle and a 12 day cycle and like different combinations of the cycles mean different things.

**00:19:30** And it's like, oh, look at this.

**00:19:31** Like, I think you could actually design something that works pretty well, like for actual human times was like, but guess what?

**00:19:37** Seven's a prime number.

**00:19:39** So you, right?

**00:19:40** Like nothing you can possibly invent is ever going to line up with the seven day schedule on any kind of scale.

**00:19:48** You know, it's just like, it just mathematically doesn't work no matter how much you try.

**00:19:52** Although I've tried many times to somehow defeat prime numbers.

**00:19:57** Like, I don't know what I was thinking, but yeah.

**00:19:59** So while I was taking the weekend really seriously, I just kept thinking that everything about the, this traditional work week doesn't work, but is there something that I can fix?

**00:20:08** And for me at least realizing that I find I rarely really need the two days in a row off and that the two days offers are sort of, they're ineffective being back to back.

**00:20:22** And so I thought, okay, weekend Wednesday is going to be a weekend day and I'm going to take that work day and put it on Saturday so that I have two days of work, one day off, three days of work, one day off, and just repeat that cycle over and over again.

**00:20:38** And I have to say it's, it has been, I've been doing it basically the whole quarantine and I love it.

**00:20:44** Like I just, I find it is perfect as much as can be done within the constraints of a seven day week.

**00:20:52** This little pattern I think is about as optimal, at least for me as, as I can possibly make it.

**00:20:58** And so, uh, yeah, that's why I made like this little light gray video where I want to like propagandize this concept.

**00:21:04** And like, obviously this is not going to work for 99.9% of people on the planet, but I think there are enough people who, if they're able to have some control over their schedule, might

**00:21:14** benefit from trying something like this out, you know, cause again, there's not, there's not an infinite number of different types of people.

**00:21:20** I think this could really work for some self-employed people or for some students.

**00:21:25** And yeah, I've just absolutely loved this new schedule and I think this is going to last for the rest of my life.

**00:21:32** I suspect well beyond quarantine at least.

**00:21:34** So what day did you, you removed Saturday, right?

**00:21:37** Yeah.

**00:21:37** So Saturday is a work day.

**00:21:38** Right.

**00:21:39** That's, that's what happened.

**00:21:41** I think the thing that I liked about it the most, which is a very good point of like, if you work Saturday, that is like a day when you can put in things where you don't want to be disrupted.

**00:21:54** Yeah.

**00:21:54** Because nobody else is working.

**00:21:56** So they'll leave you alone.

**00:21:57** Yeah.

**00:21:57** Yeah.

**00:21:58** And, and, uh, I mean, a little bit of this comes out from back when I was being a teacher, like you have these days where you're supposed to put in like a certain amount of time before the school year starts up.

**00:22:09** And I would always try to strategize about like, I want to go in on the days when no one else is there and you can get 10,000 times more done when no one else is around.

**00:22:18** And I also find like even, even for me, it's been useful to have a day where it's just like the possibility of the outside world interrupting you is much lower, uh, like with work related stuff.

**00:22:32** If you make Saturday work day and yeah, it's just, it's been, it's been really.

**00:22:39** Really great.

**00:22:39** And I just, I find that that this, the cycle feels just about right.

**00:22:46** I don't have the feeling, uh, like I did when I was taking the weekend seriously, but still doing five days in a row of like real work of feeling like Thursday afternoon to Friday felt like really unoptimal time.

**00:23:04** Like I'm still working, but I'm working at a lower percent efficiency than otherwise.

**00:23:10** And so I think like having a weekend Wednesday day as a break day really feels like it keeps the efficiency up much higher for all of the other work days.

**00:23:20** Although again, because I haven't actually put that video up yet and we're recording ahead of time.

**00:23:25** This is one of those videos that like, I'm a little worried about like, how is this going to be received?

**00:23:29** Like, I don't know if everybody's going to totally hate this.

**00:23:31** I know.

**00:23:33** Look at you.

**00:23:34** You can change your work.

**00:23:36** Yeah.

**00:23:36** This is, this is totally alike.

**00:23:38** Well, that's great for CGP gray, you know, you know, obviously there's no big company in the world that would ever do it because too many people would hate it.

**00:23:47** But again, I'm thinking of, you know, some of, some of the teams of people that I know, you know, like in, in YouTube and education land where they're like small teams of people, I could totally see a small team of people trying it out.

**00:24:00** And, and thinking like, oh, this actually works.

**00:24:03** Flexible time exists.

**00:24:04** Yeah.

**00:24:04** Flexible time exists.

**00:24:05** It's a thing that lots of companies do.

**00:24:08** Yeah.

**00:24:08** And even the people that I work with are very happy to have some concept of like, when is he around?

**00:24:15** When is he not around?

**00:24:16** You know, like, so even here, like, you know, I don't enforce a schedule on anybody, but just knowing like what days is gray working or what days is gray not working.

**00:24:27** Even, even within like with that or even within my own like personal life, just with my family, I'm surprised at how everybody is thrilled to know like what days is he on and what days is he off?

**00:24:38** Yeah.

**00:24:38** Imagine if it was possible to like share a bit of a schedule with people.

**00:24:43** What are you, what are you trying to get at?

**00:24:44** Make them happy.

**00:24:46** Collaborate and walk with you.

**00:24:48** I don't know.

**00:24:49** What do you, what do you, what are you trying to get at here?

**00:24:51** I don't understand the point you're trying to make.

**00:24:52** Structure gray, you know, like it's people love it.

**00:26:26** CortexMerch.com.

**00:26:28** CortexMerch.com.

**00:26:30** We have a limited quantity available now.

**00:26:33** What I'm referring to in my mind is the doomed reprint of the theme system journal.

**00:26:37** Oh, it's very serious sounding.

**00:26:39** Well, this order was placed in November.

**00:26:43** Oh, God.

**00:26:43** No, that can't be true.

**00:26:44** That cannot be true.

**00:26:46** I had the order in before Lunar New Year.

**00:26:50** That was the goal.

**00:26:52** I put this order in, I believe, at the end of 2019.

**00:26:59** 2019 even happened.

**00:27:00** Was 2019 real?

**00:27:01** I just feel so long ago.

**00:27:03** Okay.

**00:27:04** At that point, I really couldn't remember what year was last year.

**00:27:07** I really could not remember that.

**00:27:10** So I put this order in, in either maybe December or maybe January of this year.

**00:27:15** But the idea was to beat Lunar New Year.

**00:27:17** And for anybody that doesn't remember, coronavirus hit in China during Lunar New Year.

**00:27:24** Like that was when it spread because that was people coming together and that was that.

**00:27:30** Right.

**00:27:30** So it is kind of like when I look back on it now with hindsight, it's like not a funny ha ha, but like a funny thing.

**00:27:38** Like I was very aware, more aware of coronavirus than most people because our notebooks were delayed.

**00:27:44** Right.

**00:27:45** But I never thought, right, like nobody did, I never thought that this would happen.

**00:27:51** You know, I have no concept of it, of something like this.

**00:27:54** It was just like, oh, maybe it'll be like swine flu.

**00:27:57** I guess.

**00:27:58** No.

**00:27:59** Anyway, so this reprint is the order that has been in the works for the best part of eight months.

**00:28:06** And the other thing is like I cannot find the energy to actually talk about all of this, but like it wasn't just this.

**00:28:14** There were also like multiple issues with this reprint.

**00:28:19** This was the one where, Gray, you may remember this, where they I think I told you about it.

**00:28:23** I don't know if I've told this story on the show where I was sent box of samples of 50 samples and only three arrived.

**00:28:31** Oh, right.

**00:28:32** Yeah.

**00:28:32** And then two days later, the rest arrived because the box was damaged.

**00:28:36** But it's like there's just been this is just this entire reprint has been a comedy of errors, but they are available now.

**00:28:42** You can go to cortex much dot com.

**00:28:43** We still have a small amount left.

**00:28:45** So if you do want one, get one.

**00:28:48** And I will say, just like we are working on the second edition.

**00:28:51** This will most likely be the last reprint of the current version of the book.

**00:28:58** So the second version, the book, the structure is the same, but there are some features that we're adding and I'm changing some stuff about the way it's printed to make the process more manageable.

**00:29:11** Yeah, I'll say that I'll talk about that later on.

**00:29:14** But yeah, so you can get them now.

**00:29:16** Cortex merch dot com.

**00:29:18** If you want to journal, get a journal right now.

**00:29:24** I remember how hard it was to get them printed the first time and I'm basically restarting the process.

**00:29:29** So look like we all we all know like, oh, look, Cortex journal is going through a chip transition.

**00:29:34** You know, so should I get the next one or should I get the now one?

**00:29:37** Get the now one.

**00:29:38** Like I'm telling you that right now, man.

**00:29:41** You want to journal.

**00:29:42** You better buy it right now.

**00:29:43** Use one and come in towards the end of it.

**00:29:46** Or if you think you might be interested, you should buy one of these because I there will be more hopefully this year.

**00:29:54** But like, who knows?

**00:29:56** Yeah, it's difficult to deal with.

**00:29:59** Yeah, yeah, we're working on it.

**00:30:01** But, you know, it is it's hard to make promises.

**00:30:06** It's hard to have estimates.

**00:30:08** Considering the amount of these that we have sold and the amount of times that we've had them for sale, it would seem like maybe this is like a little thing that we work on.

**00:30:21** Like, I'm not kidding.

**00:30:22** I spend time every single day on this project.

**00:30:28** Right. Every day I'm doing something on this project.

**00:30:31** Yeah, it is.

**00:30:32** This is a very hard business to run.

**00:30:36** Yeah, I mean, we said a year ago, like, oh, you can totally understand now how anybody who manufactures a physical product, it takes so much longer than you think.

**00:30:45** And this is this has been a real lesson in that of you think, oh, why can't they just make another?

**00:30:51** It's like, oh, no, no.

**00:30:53** When you start talking about supply chains and factories and all the rest of it, it's not as easy as just you wanting to do it.

**00:31:00** Yeah.

**00:31:02** But like, you know, basically the work that I'm putting in now is from having spent a lot of time learning over the last year and a bit.

**00:31:09** Right. And so I feel like I'm in so much of a better place now than I was a year ago, which in trying to understand how to make this stuff work.

**00:31:17** And I feel like I'm taking what I've learned and putting it into the second edition with the plan being of making this a more sustainable isn't the word, but like a running, constantly running.

**00:31:31** Product, which it hasn't been.

**00:31:33** Yeah. The way I described it is you're trying to smooth out the variance.

**00:31:37** I love like we don't want big shipments occasionally.

**00:31:41** Like we want to be able to figure out how to how to make this more of a regular thing.

**00:31:44** That's that's the main goal.

**00:31:45** Somebody goes to cortex much.com on July 29th to buy a journal.

**00:31:50** I just want there to be one for them.

**00:31:52** It's a simple thing.

**00:31:54** That's the plan.

**00:31:55** Because then once we finally get that done, I can turn my attention to other projects that I've wanted to work on for two years.

**00:32:03** Yes.

**00:32:04** That are related to the cortex brand company.

**00:32:07** But the entire output of the cortex brand company is just soaked up by the system journal one day.

**00:32:16** So anyway, cortex, merch.com.

**00:32:20** So I have been on a bit of a quest with real time collaboration.

**00:32:26** Okay.

**00:32:26** So my mind has been taken up by note taking.

**00:32:29** But I noticed that you'd put something in our document about note taking as well.

**00:32:34** Oh, okay.

**00:32:36** You know, listeners, I've just been through a big thing.

**00:32:40** Like we're recording.

**00:32:41** I guess it's a little more than two weeks after I put up that whole like CGP Grey was wrong video where I was partly like reevaluating.

**00:32:49** My entire process of working.

**00:32:51** Yeah.

**00:32:51** If I can give it a one sentence summary, let's just say there was an error in the research process of a video and then you made what I think is a very good video about your process, which people can find in the show notes.

**00:33:05** I'll put a link to it.

**00:33:06** They haven't seen it already.

**00:33:07** So it was, yeah, it's just, it's been like, it's been quite a two weeks is what it's been.

**00:33:12** Or three weeks now, actually.

**00:33:13** And so as, as, as part of like the internal post-mortem of that project, it's funny.

**00:33:21** I realized at one point, like, so I basically, um, like I took a week off of all writing projects.

**00:33:27** I decided, okay, after this, what I can't do is I can't just, you know, Oh, well, that was an interesting, terrible experience.

**00:33:36** And like, let me just dive right into whatever the next video was going to be.

**00:33:39** I felt like, okay, now I need to, I need to take some time off here.

**00:33:42** And now that the correction has been made and like all, all of that has been done, I need to like, just sort of think about the actual process, what it's going to look like going forward or be able to think without a time constraint.

**00:33:58** On like, what might I want to change or, you know, how might things be different?

**00:34:02** And it was funny at some point I realized, Oh, I'm doing the thing that I think people think I spend all of my time doing, which is thinking about

**00:34:11** productivity, right?

**00:34:13** Like, and trying new apps and systems.

**00:34:16** Yeah.

**00:34:16** And trying new apps and systems.

**00:34:18** And it's just like, it just struck me like three days into the project as a really funny thing.

**00:34:22** This is the phenomenon.

**00:34:24** This is a long, I'm going a long way around here.

**00:34:26** All right.

**00:34:26** To make a point.

**00:34:27** No, no, no.

**00:34:27** This is like the phenomenon that people talk about that causes like FOMO with Instagram influencers.

**00:34:34** What do you mean?

**00:34:34** Where you as a consumer only see what they show you.

**00:34:40** Right.

**00:34:41** So like what an influencer shows you.

**00:34:42** So it looks like they're traveling all the time because they just show you that they're traveling all the time.

**00:34:48** Yeah.

**00:34:49** Well, for me and you, we have, we have productivity tools.

**00:34:52** Yeah.

**00:34:52** We always tell the cortex and we have every tool that we use.

**00:34:56** Yeah.

**00:34:56** But that doesn't mean all we do is try new tools.

**00:35:01** Right.

**00:35:01** So like every time we do it, we tell you about it.

**00:35:04** So it feels like we do it a lot.

**00:35:05** Yeah.

**00:35:06** Yeah.

**00:35:06** It's a, it is a very funny selection effect that I mean, it's, it's easily got to be 99% of the things that I ever try or think about relating to productivity are discussed on the show.

**00:35:22** But I'm not spending 99% of all time.

**00:35:26** Yeah.

**00:35:26** It's just, it's just funny.

**00:35:28** And I think this is also unlike the influencer effect, which is, it's just a pure selection effect.

**00:35:33** I also just think like the, you know, the topic of work is always endlessly interesting to me.

**00:35:38** Like I always, when I meet new people, I do always love to ask them like, you know, how do you work and how does it go?

**00:35:43** Because people are just so wildly different.

**00:35:47** Like one big slider that people end on different parts of is the, like, how much do you need scaffolding to assist you with your work versus how much are you like Nike and you can just do it.

**00:36:01** Right.

**00:36:01** And I think that there's often like a lot of confusion between those two groups, like not understanding each other.

**00:36:09** And so I think the people who are more on the just do it end of the spectrum, then get like doubly frustrated with this person talks about productivity all the time.

**00:36:19** You know, and it's, it's just like, there's, there's like an additional layer here on top of the selection effect, but it also just like really made me smile when the thought popped into my head.

**00:36:29** I was like, Oh, here I am.

**00:36:31** I'm reading a bunch of stuff on a particularly note taking was what was my main focus.

**00:36:37** But I was like, I just, I just realized like I am the picture right now of what people think I am.

**00:36:42** I'm like, I've got two iPads in front of me.

**00:36:45** I'm taking like notes on one of those iPads.

**00:36:48** I've got a whole bunch of index cards spread across my kitchen table and there's like pens.

**00:36:53** And it was like, it was just a funny moment to become like self-aware.

**00:36:57** Like, Oh, this is the thing.

**00:36:58** You were like gray prime.

**00:37:01** Exactly.

**00:37:02** It was like, I'm the idea in people's heads of what I am.

**00:37:06** It's just like, okay, this is silly.

**00:37:08** But yeah, I have to say like, it was a really interesting, I'm sort of coming to the end of that time now and booting back up the writing projects.

**00:37:16** I'm not a hundred percent settled on it.

**00:37:18** So this is still a little bit of like thoughts in progress on a thing.

**00:37:21** But one of the areas that I just sort of recognized as like what really needs rethinking is how do I take notes?

**00:37:32** Right.

**00:37:32** Like, so when I'm working on a project, how do I organize the information related to that project?

**00:37:40** Right.

**00:37:40** You know, and this is, we've always talked about it.

**00:37:42** The section of the show with the best show art of any of them ever core, right, is for years I've used Evernote as the place that is like all of my notes.

**00:37:57** And so for all topics, anything that I think is interesting, like I just save web pages and PDFs and books and like everything goes into Evernote and like all of it is tagged with what is vaguely the topic that it's related to.

**00:38:11** And I've just like, I realized I've never really thought about that system since I first started doing it, you know, nine years ago or whatever.

**00:38:22** I've just never mentally reevaluated it.

**00:38:25** What do you mean?

**00:38:26** I mean, we've spoken about you wanting to leave Evernote a bunch of times.

**00:38:29** Okay.

**00:38:29** So no, so here's what I mean by like not reevaluating it.

**00:38:33** So people are like, Hey, have you heard the good news about Microsoft OneNote?

**00:38:37** I don't know if you've ever heard of a thing called Devin think, but this exists, you know, like that's a totally different sort of question of are you frustrated with Evernote?

**00:38:46** Are there problems with the app that you don't like that kind of thing?

**00:38:49** So that was always more the application not being suited to the process.

**00:38:54** Yeah.

**00:38:55** But what you weren't considering was the process.

**00:38:58** Like, how do I save a piece of information?

**00:39:01** Where is it stored?

**00:39:02** How is it tagged?

**00:39:03** What are these pieces of information?

**00:39:06** Yeah, it's, it's, it's actually, it's a little tricky to even articulate, but, but I guess what I, what I would say is this is like on all of my projects, I would just have a huge pile of like, here's all the primary sources related to whatever this topic is.

**00:39:23** You know, so, and I would, I would work through those things and like, I would write a script based on them, but, um, so, okay, so here, let me back up and talk about like.

**00:39:35** The story of, of like, Grey's history with the concept of notes, right?

**00:39:40** And taking notes, right?

**00:39:42** So I've always thought that like the way people think about notes in particularly like a school situation is that notes are totally worthless has, has always been my experience.

**00:39:56** Like I don't understand why this happens.

**00:40:00** I have a, I have a particularly weird situation with this because I literally never took notes in school because as we found out later, I was not able to read the board.

**00:40:11** For some reason I snuck through the entire eye testing system and it was never noticed until I was well into high school that my vision was not good enough to actually see the board.

**00:40:23** And so I always had the experience of, yeah, you sit in school and you know, you listen to the teacher and then you know, you take the test based on like what you can remember or what's in the textbook.

**00:40:36** What did you think the board was for then?

**00:40:39** Okay.

**00:40:40** That's an excellent question, Mike.

**00:40:44** I don't want to get off on like an entire side tangent of this, but I have in the past year really become increasingly fascinated with this concept.

**00:40:52** Of how people can not notice the things in life that they don't notice, right?

**00:40:59** Or like how brains can be different and you're just completely unaware of something.

**00:41:03** And so what did I think the board was for is a fantastic question.

**00:41:10** And like the best answer I can give is I guess I thought that this was like the teacher was working out things for themselves.

**00:41:19** Like, you know, when you're doing a math problem, you have to write it down.

**00:41:23** It's their own reference material.

**00:41:26** Yeah.

**00:41:26** Like it was like the board was for the teacher, I guess, you know.

**00:41:30** Um, but, but I think the, like the deeper truth of it was because I didn't, I couldn't see the board.

**00:41:38** I just didn't consider it.

**00:41:39** Right.

**00:41:39** Like it just wasn't really in my world.

**00:41:42** And this also happened to be a perfect storm of things because, um, the way the New York state education system works is that everything is based around a series of like extremely automated, standardized tests.

**00:41:57** You know, like everything is multiple choice, even physics tests.

**00:42:00** Like they're all multiple choice as much as can be humanly automated is.

**00:42:05** And so as a student, you have a really clear target.

**00:42:09** There are these standardized tests.

**00:42:11** There's like books about how to pass them.

**00:42:14** All of the classes are oriented towards that.

**00:42:17** There's very little human subjectivity.

**00:42:20** And so the effect of like the particularities of individual teachers was greatly lessened under that system.

**00:42:27** Right.

**00:42:27** Which also means that like, it doesn't matter so much if you're just preparing for the English Regents exam or the math Regents exam.

**00:42:34** Like that's just a thing that you can do and no one cares.

**00:42:37** None of the teachers cared about your notebooks.

**00:42:39** Cause like that was entirely like, Hey kid, this is your problem.

**00:42:42** All we care about is how well you're doing on our like practice standardized tests.

**00:42:48** So that's also how, like, how on earth did I get through this without being noticed?

**00:42:51** And also it like, I guess there's also an element of like random chance in it because you had to always be in every class far enough away from the board that you could never read it.

**00:43:05** Okay.

**00:43:06** So, so I have the answer to this question, which is that at least in my high school, you were always allowed to pick your seats.

**00:43:12** Yeah.

**00:43:12** That first day of class, it was always my goal to sit in the back corner, right?

**00:43:16** One of the two back corners was like, that is my prime target.

**00:43:18** And then as close as I can get to that is what I was always aiming for.

**00:43:21** Okay.

**00:43:22** So, so there wasn't the random chance of like, Oh, I'm in the front in some classes.

**00:43:26** I was never in the front.

**00:43:27** It's like you sit in the front one day and it's like, Oh, like all the formulations start passing in front of your eyes.

**00:43:35** What is this incredible source of information?

**00:43:38** Well, well, again, like I just think there's a way in which it's just not obvious to you.

**00:43:43** If you don't know the other thing for me was like, I didn't know you could see people's faces right across the street.

**00:43:50** So it like, it never occurred to me that humans can identify other humans by their face at greater distances.

**00:43:56** Yeah.

**00:43:56** When I got glasses for the first time, I kind of equated it like going from standard definition to high definition.

**00:44:02** Right.

**00:44:03** Right.

**00:44:03** There were just signs that I didn't read and I just figured you couldn't read them until you got a little bit closer.

**00:44:08** Right.

**00:44:09** Exactly.

**00:44:09** Yeah.

**00:44:09** My vision is not as bad as yours clearly, but, but like, it is, you know, I can, I can understand that a little bit, but there is just this, I mean, it's kind of hilarious really that like, just like what board?

**00:44:23** What are you talking about?

**00:44:24** Yeah.

**00:44:25** It just didn't exist in my world.

**00:44:26** And I think this is like just one of, of several kinds of examples where like you have no reason to notice a deficiency.

**00:44:37** My like other example of this is color blindness, you know, like for people who are colorblind, once you have like a set of tests, this is a very easy thing to identify.

**00:44:47** But people can go a long time without knowing that they're colorblind because it just like, how does this concept enter your mind if, if it's not like brought out in an A B testing kind of situation?

**00:45:01** You can just think like, Oh, other people are better at distinguishing these two things, but like, it just doesn't really cross your mind.

**00:45:07** Right.

**00:45:07** Like why, why would it?

**00:45:08** But yeah.

**00:45:09** So in high school, I was like, Oh, notes serve no purpose.

**00:45:13** And even after I got my glasses, you know, I didn't like start taking notes then.

**00:45:19** I just thought like, Oh, you know, look at all the stuff that teachers writing on the board.

**00:45:23** How academically interesting is that?

**00:45:25** But you know, like I don't, I'm not going to start this now.

**00:45:28** And then when I went into college as a general statement, like all of my physics professors provided class notes because their whole thing was like, Hey, what we're doing here is really hard.

**00:45:40** Pay attention and think it through.

**00:45:42** Like don't waste your time writing notes in class.

**00:45:46** And so that ended up being like my first formal exposure to notes was like, don't bother.

**00:45:53** Like we're going to give you notes.

**00:45:55** You know, you're grown up now.

**00:45:56** We don't have to, we don't have to like do this pretend game.

**00:45:59** When I became a teacher myself, I attempted to replicate creating class notes for my students.

**00:46:05** And then I was immediately told by the school, like, you can't just give notes to your students in the UK system.

**00:46:13** It's incredibly important that all of the students are like little tiny mimeograph machines.

**00:46:19** Like they have to write down all of the things that you say in class word for word.

**00:46:24** And so my experience as a teacher was like, this whole note system is fraudulent.

**00:46:29** I have to make kids write down notes so that the school doesn't fire me because the school cares about when the inspectors come.

**00:46:39** We have a bunch of notebooks to demonstrate that learning has occurred to the inspectors because obviously like no one can learn anything if you haven't had like written documentation of that having occurred.

**00:46:52** So this is this like funny way of saying that like I have an entire lifetime of academic experience that told me taking notes is a kind of nonsensical busy work.

**00:47:06** And whenever like looking at productivity materials like reading books or watching videos about like how people are productive, I was always really puzzled at the parts where people are like, oh, I read a book.

**00:47:21** And I take these, you know, these detailed notes on like what the book was or like, what are the important ideas?

**00:47:28** And I like I just always found that odd.

**00:47:31** Like, I don't understand what this is.

**00:47:33** And I thought it was a kind of.

**00:47:36** I don't know, like a kind of cargo culting like, oh, this is a this is a thing that you learned in school about how people learn, you know, but you're learning when you read the book and then you remember the things that are in the book like the, you know, these notes aren't doing anything except

**00:47:51** they're like just a repeated behavior.

**00:47:53** So all of this brings to like, oh, what was I doing when I'm making videos?

**00:47:58** And the answer is like, oh, I'm reading tons of stuff and I'm remembering things.

**00:48:02** And the key skill is like be able to remember where the information that you need is like you can just like, OK, yeah, I read this thing in this article.

**00:48:12** Like, let me go back and check where that was.

**00:48:15** So like I read through books and I do highlights and then I would import those highlights and surrounding information into Evernote.

**00:48:21** And it's like, OK, great.

**00:48:22** Now I've got a version of this book that instead of having to reread 300 pages, I've pulled out like here are the 20 key pages that are related to whatever it is that I'm working on.

**00:48:34** So there's a way in which like I can reread this book in minutes, like not reread this book over the course of days.

**00:48:41** Right. So like this is kind of what Evernote.

**00:48:44** Was to me was a really big pile of mostly primary sources with occasionally really brief in quotes notes at the top of these primary sources, which would be me just like very briefly, perhaps summarizing like, oh, what was the important thing in this one?

**00:49:04** Or like, this is the one that talks about that piece of information.

**00:49:07** Like, that's what that's what Evernote was for me.

**00:49:10** Does that make sense?

**00:49:11** Yeah, I mean, I will say I don't think that when you're saying like the like notes part, like it's not notes, like that's not taking of sources.

**00:49:19** Right. Like if I was doing what you were doing, that's what I would do.

**00:49:23** Right. OK, but so I almost wish we were recording this episode like two weeks from now because I think I could articulate some of this stuff better.

**00:49:30** Well, that's what follow up's for.

**00:49:32** Yeah. But I think one of the key concepts I've had here is is like a partly even writing little summaries to yourself is like not what Evernote is for.

**00:49:46** Evernote really should be like a library of primary sources only.

**00:49:54** There is a useful layer of what we can call notes that can exist on top of this.

**00:50:02** And like and that's what I've been exploring this past week is OK, let me try to get out of my head all of this like academic cruft that has built up in my head about like what notes are and try to re like re approach this topic.

**00:50:19** So this would be because I'm trying to follow here.

**00:50:22** The idea here is instead of attaching all of the notes to sources, you have notes about certain projects, certain topics, certain things.

**00:50:33** And if needed to, you can say like, oh, I got it from here and then later, then you can go back to Evernote and you can find the source if you need it.

**00:50:40** Is that right? Yeah, that's partly what I'm talking about, you know, because because again, like one of the things where it's like, why do I think notes were sort of weird?

**00:50:48** It's like I very rarely would make what people call like margin notes in books because it always seemed to me like I know it just it just seemed sort of pointless.

**00:51:00** Like I don't I don't understand what it is.

**00:51:02** And I do think that there is something pointless about them kind of hides the information.

**00:51:06** Yeah. So this is this is exactly it.

**00:51:08** Like it strikes me as a sort of busy work of like if you're writing this note, shouldn't that note be in the project that you're working on?

**00:51:19** Because otherwise, like how are you ever going to access that again?

**00:51:23** You have to read the book again.

**00:51:24** Exactly. So this is where like my script, my like quote script document often started with lots of like what would be margin notes in some sense, like just kind of got thrown into the script document is like, OK, well, this is the place where they go because I actually need to work with them.

**00:51:42** So I guess what I'll say is like one of the one of the places where I found useful information to start and that got me kind of like thinking about it in the right way is I almost hesitate to mention it because you know, again, like we have there's like the notion nation nation represent.

**00:52:01** There's the Rome heads like there's there's all these different there's all these different like groups, the Rome Rome, Rome, Rome, Rome, enthusiasts.

**00:52:09** Yeah, something that's a better one in there somewhere.

**00:52:11** We can come up with somewhere somewhere it is.

**00:52:13** Yeah. Oh, Rome writers like you let us know what it is.

**00:52:17** What about romanticists?

**00:52:21** That's terrible. I can't rate that zero out of 1000.

**00:52:24** That's all right. I mean, come on, you could have just gone 10.

**00:52:28** I don't know. Maybe the romanticists really like that kind of terrible pun.

**00:52:32** You just used it. It's not canon.

**00:53:55** A thanks to ExpressVPN for their support of this show and all of Relay FM.

**00:54:00** So there's also a thing which is like trying to say like, oh, what are all these people up to?

**00:54:04** Like this has become this popular genre and figuring things out.

**00:54:07** And so anyway, like while wandering around the internet, I found another like really, really niche, like sub community of this kind of thing, which I'm going to call the Zetal Zealots.

**00:54:21** What is that?

**00:54:23** So I came across this note taking system, which is called Zetalcastin.

**00:54:28** And I refuse.

**00:54:31** I refuse.

**00:54:33** Yeah. Z-E-T-T-L-E-K-A-S-T-E-N.

**00:54:38** Zetalcastin.

**00:54:40** Is this German?

**00:54:41** Yeah, it is German.

**00:54:43** And and some of the some of the Zetal Zealots will insist that you should say it in German, like so it should be to Zetal.

**00:54:51** And it's like, no, like hard.

**00:54:53** Like I have this with Edina.

**00:54:56** It's like because of her surname, Niamtzu.

**00:54:59** Yeah, that that TS sound.

**00:55:01** Yeah. She would say to me, it's it's the Z sound in pizza.

**00:55:04** Right.

**00:55:05** So it's Zetal custom, I guess, something like that.

**00:55:08** And now every German just laughed at me.

**00:55:10** But yeah, yeah, I know the sound like I have the same thing with Dutch where like there's sounds that I can hear in it and like I can identify that sound, but I just I cannot reproduce it properly.

**00:55:20** So anyway, I'm going to say Zetalcastin and there's like this community of like Zetal Zealots.

**00:55:25** But there's there's some interesting stuff in here and like I don't want to get into the whole thing.

**00:55:30** Is this an app?

**00:55:30** I can't. It doesn't look like it's an app.

**00:55:33** I'm like, you're going to make me get into the whole thing.

**00:55:35** No, it's a system, right?

**00:55:37** It's a system. Right.

**00:55:38** It's a system. And the best way I can I can sort of explain it is like like with anything, I'm not really interested in the system itself.

**00:55:48** It's like, oh, there was a person who invented the system and he wrote a million books because of it.

**00:55:54** And it's like, OK, great. Like all that lore, whatever.

**00:55:56** Like I'm just I'm here as like a value vampire to just extract whatever happens to be useful to me from this system of yours.

**00:56:04** Right. And one of the key concepts that I've come across, which just like it was never clear in my mind, was this distinction between.

**00:56:16** Sources and notes.

**00:56:19** And so this is this is what I'm getting at with like with Evernote is like the moment you're writing anything in Evernote,

**00:56:27** like that's the wrong place for it.

**00:56:29** Evernote is where primary sources exist.

**00:56:33** And your script is is the place where like the script is the project that, you know,

**00:56:41** that should be like the words that you're going to record into a microphone to turn into a video.

**00:56:45** But there does additionally exist a category of useful writing, which we can call notes.

**00:56:53** And the one of the valuable ideas that I've extracted from the Zettelkasten system is it just fits in perfectly with stuff that I've done before.

**00:57:04** Like, OK. You're thinking of notes like when you were in school and you're supposed to have like a three ring binder that tells you everything you ever wanted to never know about the English Civil War.

**00:57:15** Right. Or whatever. It's like, no, forget that.

**00:57:18** Instead, what you want are like index cards.

**00:57:22** Think of it in a physical way.

**00:57:23** You've got a whole bunch of index cards and each index card is a note and each note should be a single idea.

**00:57:33** About this topic or it should be a single summary of a primary source that exists elsewhere.

**00:57:43** And these are your notes on the topic.

**00:57:46** And coming across this, I felt like, oh, this is a huge relief because it felt like two things.

**00:57:53** One, it reminded me of forever ago coming across getting things done where it was really important for someone to create this distinction of you have to do lists.

**00:58:06** But there's two things here. There's projects and there's actions.

**00:58:10** And like a lot of your problem around to do lists is that you're not drawing this distinction in your mind.

**00:58:16** And I think like I'd never had this just pointed out in a clear way of like primary sources and notes and that notes exist as like atomic individual ideas.

**00:58:34** You're not trying to like recreate a whole book with your notes.

**00:58:38** You're trying to have like a stack of index cards with information about this topic that you can look at.

**00:58:44** And this has been incredibly helpful.

**00:58:46** And it was also like, oh, this is perfect because I realize that quite naturally, this is a thing that I've sort of done many times when I'm stuck with a project, which is, OK, stop looking at it on your computer.

**00:59:01** Write out some of the basic ideas on index cards and like put them on a table in front of you and sort of think about it for a while.

**00:59:07** And like, you know, as we've discussed many times, being able to work with paper is often quite clarifying when you're having problems in a digital system.

**00:59:16** I think I'm struggling to understand a little bit.

**00:59:19** Yes. Here's the thing. Please ask questions because it's also helpful to me at this point to clarify because like a lot of this stuff is still not perfectly settled in my mind.

**00:59:29** But I feel like I'm on the right track with a really important reevaluation of how the system works going forward that I haven't reevaluated in like a long time in this way.

**00:59:41** All right. So I have two things I want to do.

**00:59:43** One is I think I've found a summary of the method on Wikipedia, but I'll leave that for a minute.

**00:59:48** Right. I'll leave that for a minute because I might not need to get to this.

**00:59:52** We're going to tell you right now. Don't read anything about it. It won't help you.

**00:59:56** Right. So then I'm trying to understand then what this new system is for you and why Zettelkasten is involved at all, because let's say you've read a research paper and there are things in that research paper that you want to remember.

**01:00:11** They're like notes that you want to take. Right. Where do they go? Don't worry about the Apple, whatever.

**01:00:16** But like, do you have a separate place right now that you'll put quotes and thoughts in?

**01:00:22** OK, so so yeah, right now, since I'm I'm still I'm still in the playing around with it phase, but let's talk about the idea in the abstract.

**01:00:29** Right. So as you're reading through some primary source, when something that's interesting comes along, one of the ideas is like, OK, by hand, write a summary of that on a little index card.

**01:00:43** And so it's like, OK, Liberty Island got bigger over time.

**01:00:47** And it's like, oh, OK, well, that's interesting. That's an interesting piece of information.

**01:00:50** So like Liberty Island is three times larger than it was 200 years ago.

**01:00:56** It's like a note on this topic. And that can just live on an index card because this is like the smallest condensation of a single idea.

**01:01:07** And so it's like, OK, that just goes. And as you keep reading through sources, it's like, oh, there was a Supreme Court case in 1800 about this dispute.

**01:01:17** OK, so then you go and you read that Supreme Court case, you find out like some piece of information.

**01:01:23** And again, like you'll write down a discrete fact on on this.

**01:01:27** It's like no documentation exists for why the island got bigger.

**01:01:32** I don't mean to be a dick. But this is like how I studied history.

**01:01:39** Which was just like I had a notebook and what I did was write down facts, figures and tiny pieces of information when I was in school so I could pass the test.

**01:01:48** And I say that as in such a way as like, I don't want to make fun of you not being able to see the board.

**01:01:55** No, no. I mean, man, like, don't don't get me wrong.

**01:01:58** Like this this is a that's why this is like such a weird topic for me, because it's like and it's also just been is why I mentioned at the beginning, like, how can you not notice a thing that you're missing?

**01:02:10** Right. Yeah. Is is it really is like every time you know you ever want to I'd ever watch a video and someone's like, here's here's how I use Rome and I'm going to take a bunch of notes on a thing.

**01:02:21** I was like, what are you even doing?

**01:02:23** Like, I don't understand why you feel the need to write all this stuff over again.

**01:02:28** This is so fascinating to me. This is fascinating.

**01:02:32** I can't get my head around how someone who does what you do didn't really do this.

**01:02:39** I guess you were more like highlighting things because you always talk about the highlights and of the Kindle books, right?

**01:02:47** Yeah. So like highlighting in Kindle books and importing books into Kindle.

**01:02:51** Like this, this is also one of the reasons why I was always like I cannot possibly leave Evernote because of all the right because of like the highlights and the ability to import this is incredible.

**01:03:01** Like the scales are falling from my eyes.

**01:03:03** Right now I get it way more like it wasn't just it always felt to me.

**01:03:08** And I'm sure now this is why people would always say, why should it one that was wrong with you?

**01:03:15** It wasn't the system. It was the actual like application.

**01:03:20** The data was there. What else were you going to do?

**01:03:23** Like you couldn't move because you weren't moving notes.

**01:03:28** You were moving massive pieces of information that had notes in them.

**01:03:33** Yeah. Which were more like underlines of stuff rather than you seeing a thing and being like, right.

**01:03:39** I'll write that one down.

**01:03:41** Yeah. And again, like the thing it's it's it's so again, it's like there's just this way in which I've never really thought about what I was doing.

**01:03:50** But part of the reason why over the years I've talked about highlights is because of this of this key thing of like I need to be able to highlight the important things because when I come back to whatever this is, I need to be able to reread this entire book in 20 minutes.

**01:04:06** Right. And that like and that's what I need to be able to do.

**01:04:08** And that's like the wrong. It's like the wrong thing.

**01:04:12** What you needed is, oh, I just got to go to the notes on this subject.

**01:04:16** I don't need to go back to the book.

**01:04:17** The other thing that I would say is like what I was working with is a memory of primary sources like whenever I'm working on any project, it's like, OK, I've got a folder in Evernote, you know, which is like, oh, here's all the primary sources about whatever this topic is.

**01:04:35** But I'm also able to remember very well, like, oh, I read this thing in that thing.

**01:04:39** Like, let me go back and just double check whatever these numbers are.

**01:04:42** Right. But this is this is one of those four systems because you are relying on your memory.

**01:04:49** Oh, I know. Right. Like, yeah.

**01:04:50** Then you need it to. Because if you're having to remember where to go to find the information, the system's wrong.

**01:05:00** Yeah, because you what you need is just the one place that all the information is on one topic rather than here's a folder of 20 research papers.

**01:05:10** All I have to do is remember which research paper to go to. Right.

**01:05:14** Yeah. Yeah. And it's it's also a way in which like it's just very interesting, like you see how you work and I've just never thought about it.

**01:05:21** And I've been doing this for years and just kind of build it up.

**01:05:23** I cannot believe it's taken us six years nearly to get to this.

**01:05:29** Because this is like, you know, obviously a big thing, but like I'm sure you can see how like it's fundamental.

**01:05:35** Right. Like this is this part of your system, whether it's the old way or the new ways, is like a fundamental part of the way that your research is done.

**01:05:43** And just for some reason, we have never understood with each other that this was a thing.

**01:05:50** Right. Like I had always just taken as read what you were doing and had never really thought that you didn't like it's like for me.

**01:05:58** Right. I would have a note. Let's imagine that I was making a video about the history of Nintendo.

**01:06:05** I would have a note that was like the history of Nintendo. And in that note would have subheadings with like here's something about the NES.

**01:06:13** Here's something about the SNES and like all of the little pieces of information that I would find out from watching videos, reading articles, and I would just bring them in.

**01:06:23** That's my system. But if I was working on your system, my assumption would be I would save all of that stuff

**01:06:28** to a place and make in line notes in separate places about those sources.

**01:06:35** So if I was reading an article, I would make notes on the article.

**01:06:38** Or if I was reading a video, maybe like notes in a comment, like in the video, maybe I'd save a link to it in Evernote or whatever.

**01:06:44** But then when it comes to me to them write the script, I have to be like, all right, so now I need to go back.

**01:06:49** Oh, I know there was something in the NES and this one and this one.

**01:06:53** But in the system that I always have had, all of the NES stuff would be in one place.

**01:06:59** Right. Like I feel like if I if I'm following correctly, that's kind of like the difference.

**01:07:05** Because you were saying about taking a quote unquote index card and putting in a piece of information on it. Right.

**01:07:11** What are these index cards in a digital system?

**01:07:14** Well, OK, so here's here's also part of the reason why I like like what are people doing with these notes?

**01:07:18** I don't understand is because even when you start talking about like, oh, I'm going to I'm going to write an outline, you know, we're talking about here's an A4 piece of paper.

**01:07:26** It's going to be filled with information about Nintendo.

**01:07:28** You know, they were founded in what is it?

**01:07:30** It's always like 1897 or something.

**01:07:32** It's great. They were playing card company in 1897.

**01:07:34** You know, whatever that kind of stuff that always feels to me like, why aren't you just writing a script if you're doing this?

**01:07:41** Like what is what is this thing that you're even doing here?

**01:07:43** Or the reverse of it is what is this ridiculous outline?

**01:07:46** Like, you know, you put a timeline, like have a list of dates on a piece of paper with just the basic information about what happened when all of this extra stuff is superfluous because you can just like quickly reread the book on Nintendo and like revisit the primary source and like make sure that you have everything correct.

**01:08:03** Like it's very time intensive.

**01:08:06** I think it's it's less so when you realize, like, again, why were some of the features of Evernote really key important to me?

**01:08:15** And like one of them is when you're highlighting PDF documents, Evernote has an amazing feature, which even in a PDF will like pull all of those highlights right to the front.

**01:08:24** Well, and also as well, I assume the OCR is very helpful.

**01:08:27** Yeah, the OCR is incredibly helpful.

**01:08:29** Yeah, for sure.

**01:08:29** Because if you are thinking to yourself, oh, I need every piece of information about this part, I know I've read it in some articles.

**01:08:37** You could just search for it.

**01:08:38** Yeah. Yeah.

**01:08:39** It's just very interesting.

**01:08:41** And having made these videos and have experts look them over like I have a really great track record of the experts being like, yeah, this script is totally fine.

**01:08:50** Right. It's like a great system works.

**01:08:51** You know, like there's no there's no indication of like you need any change with this.

**01:08:56** Yeah. But anyway, so like just just thinking about all of this, like to one of the key things about the Zettelkasten, which really resonates with me is I totally just I hate the concept of like

**01:09:08** notes on a single piece of paper.

**01:09:10** It's also why like the app that I use for writing my scripts is Ulysses, because one of the key features of Ulysses is they're like, no, no, no.

**01:09:19** We don't have a piece of paper that you're writing a script on.

**01:09:22** You know, they they call them sheets, I think.

**01:09:24** But it's it's the same thing where it's like pages can be arbitrarily long.

**01:09:28** They can break at any point.

**01:09:30** You know, they can have page breaks, I mean.

**01:09:32** And you can have little sections.

**01:09:35** Right. And so you can move the little sections around all the time.

**01:09:38** And I'm fairly sure that like no one uses Ulysses the way I do, where borderline, you know, every paragraph or two is broken up as a completely different little section, because I'm very often like rearranging these things.

**01:09:53** So this is why the concept of like you want to be able to move the notes around is really helpful to me, because very quickly in a project, it becomes super clear, like, oh, I don't care about this part.

**01:10:06** But if I've like written it on a piece of paper or it's like a heading on an outline, it's sort of like stuck in place and you have to deal with it.

**01:10:13** Right. Whereas, you know, if I'm working on who owns the Statue of Liberty and what I have is is like a stack of, oh, here's 40 index cards of like your notes on this topic.

**01:10:24** There's a way in which like you can sort them or arrange them in such a way that it makes more sense, like, OK, these relate to each other.

**01:10:32** This I don't care about at all.

**01:10:33** And I can like move this around.

**01:10:35** But when you're saying note, right, like this is this is the nomenclature.

**01:10:38** I really want to make sure I'm getting correct.

**01:10:40** You mean like a singular piece of information?

**01:10:45** Yes. Right.

**01:10:46** Because I think a lot of people, including me, think of a note as this page.

**01:10:52** Yeah. So this is kind of why, like, when I was looking around and reading stuff like I immediately sort of gravitated towards Zettelkasten, because this is one of the key concepts.

**01:11:02** Like they talk about notes as being atomic.

**01:11:05** Right. So it's like each note is an atomic piece of information.

**01:11:10** You shouldn't be able to reduce it.

**01:11:12** Can I read from Wikipedia now?

**01:11:13** Please let me read from Wikipedia.

**01:11:14** I think it will help. I genuinely go.

**01:11:16** Go ahead.

**01:11:17** As Zettelkasten consists of many individual notes with ideas and other short pieces of information that are taken down as they occur or are required.

**01:11:26** The notes are numbered hierarchically so that new notes may be inserted at the appropriate place and contain metadata to allow the note taker to associate the notes of each other.

**01:11:37** For example, notes may contain tags that describe key aspects of the note and they may reference other notes.

**01:11:43** The numbering metadata format and structure of the notes is subject to variation depending on the specific method employed.

**01:11:50** I think that helps because it's the idea, at least, that I think I'm following is that the reason this system seemed to meet with you is

**01:11:57** that you've got like this little piece of information and they're put into a system, but they are free to be moved around.

**01:12:05** Yes.

**01:12:06** But they are in like a hierarchy or they are associated with each other.

**01:12:12** But not in such a way of like here is an outline.

**01:12:17** Yeah. Right. OK.

**01:12:19** Yeah. Like one of the key things, you know, this again is where like my feelings about notes and outlines.

**01:12:24** So it seems like nonsense.

**01:12:26** Before you write a paper, create an outline of the paper.

**01:12:28** Like, what are you going to write in each of these sections?

**01:12:31** It's like that is a bunch of nonsense.

**01:12:32** That's saying before you write the paper, you need to know what the paper is about.

**01:12:36** It's like, well, how am I supposed to do that before I write it?

**01:12:39** You know, it's like the outlines, the hard part, like this is not the easy part to get you started.

**01:12:45** Like it's you know, I always found that stuff just really frustrating.

**01:12:48** And again, is why with so many of like the way this stuff is taught in school, it just seemed to be like,

**01:12:54** what is this charade?

**01:12:55** Everyone is playing like I don't understand.

**01:12:58** Oh, I can write an outline before I know all the things about the topic.

**01:13:01** Exactly. How am I supposed to do that?

**01:13:04** This is also why like the system of like little notes that are just individual pieces of information means

**01:13:11** it doesn't matter what order you come across these pieces of information.

**01:13:15** Right. You know, like writing and research are non-linear processes.

**01:13:19** And by having individual atomic notes, they can be created and found in any order.

**01:13:26** It doesn't matter.

**01:13:28** One of the other things that I don't know if this is going to be helpful, but since I'm still in this intermediate stage,

**01:13:34** what I suspect it's going to be helpful is I have a strong feeling that.

**01:13:41** This will help also more clearly define when am I writing

**01:13:48** versus when am I researching right now in the video creation process?

**01:13:54** And for always like those two phases have been very difficult to even distinguish from each other quite often.

**01:14:02** And so I suspect like, oh, I'll be able to draw a greater distinction between those two.

**01:14:07** And that might be useful, like even in my own time tracking system.

**01:14:11** In theory, I've always had two timers, one which is called like writing and one which is called research.

**01:14:17** But I'm very aware that I treat those two as totally indistinguishable from each other.

**01:14:21** Like very often I'm starting the research timer and then it's like, oh, I've basically spent all this time writing or vice versa.

**01:14:28** And it's like, who cares?

**01:14:29** It's this is all the same sort of non-linear, deeply interconnected process.

**01:14:35** It's not like when you write, you no longer refer to the material.

**01:14:39** Yeah. So yeah. And again, like on my computer screen, like this is also why, like whenever I'm writing,

**01:14:44** I would almost always have Evernote open on the side and it's like, oh, yeah, here's that report that dude wrote about Tumbleweeds 100 years ago.

**01:14:52** Like I want to have that on screen while I'm writing the section about Tumbleweeds, you know, that kind of thing.

**01:14:56** But it also does make it like a bit more burdensome that I'm always like 100 percent looking at the primary sources.

**01:15:02** Right. When really what you need is this group of atomic notes.

**01:15:07** Yeah. And then you can pick out the ones that are most necessary for the current part of the script that you're

**01:15:13** writing. Yeah. It's like a layer of information that exists between the script and the primary sources.

**01:15:21** Whereas I'm totally aware that I keep describing.

**01:15:25** I mean, I'm sorry, listeners, I'm sure this must be infuriating as I explain to you, like what you learned in grade school is a useful skill.

**01:15:33** Yeah, it is. This is very surreal to be talking about, like it because it's but it's I guess it's kind of fascinating

**01:15:43** because it's like how would you rediscover this type of note taking today?

**01:15:52** So, OK, so this new gray system, does it only include text?

**01:15:59** What do you mean? Well, like if you had an image.

**01:16:02** Oh, yeah. So again, since I'm just playing around and it's still very fluid, I've been largely working on actual paper because I think

**01:16:09** that's always the best way to think about something.

**01:16:12** But I have found one of these apps to do this kind of thing and it's an app called Obsidian.

**01:16:18** It's funny. It's actually someone's it's a very small team and it's their quarantine project.

**01:16:23** Like it's it's a thing that they've been working on.

**01:16:25** So it's it's still pretty early.

**01:16:29** What was that sound?

**01:16:31** This looks complicated.

**01:16:33** OK, so the reason this caught my attention and is also what's late.

**01:16:39** OK, right. OK, OK, like let me let me get there, Mike.

**01:16:43** You've been found out.

**01:16:45** So this is like a note app and I would say this is very much in the like notion roam family.

**01:16:52** You know, this is this is another version of like different people are trying to approach this sort of concept of these interconnected

**01:17:00** webs of information.

**01:17:01** This looks so complicated.

**01:17:03** Yeah, but here's here's the thing.

**01:17:04** I think finally clicked for me, which was the last time we were talking about how like, oh, I was working in Notion and I was just trying to type and slash or and then like when I hit slash a whole world of opportunities opened up to me.

**01:17:17** It's like, oh, my God, I don't I don't need to insert a a Kanban board in the middle of this sentence.

**01:17:22** But thanks, guys. Right.

**01:17:24** I think for all also reasons, which may be much more clear now, I'd also largely just totally dismiss the very notion of apps like Notion and Roam.

**01:17:32** I was like, this is just nonsense.

**01:17:33** This is just academic busy work for people who don't really need it.

**01:17:37** So it just just so happens like working with obsidian and just playing around with it and seeing like, OK, what's the deal?

**01:17:42** You know, of all of these various notes, like the Zetal heads seem to really like this this one in particular.

**01:17:48** So I was like, oh, let's play around with it.

**01:17:50** And a thing finally clicked in my head, which is I realized, oh, OK.

**01:17:57** What all of these notes systems are doing is very similar to the thing that I used to use in college, which was org mode on E-Max.

**01:18:09** And it's it's the same concept of like when you're typing at any point, you can link to something else or insert different kinds of information.

**01:18:20** And something about like the graphical user interface of a thing like Notion made makes it to me feel like really cumbersome and absurd.

**01:18:29** But when I think about it as, yeah, but you can do this whole thing just with an extremely large number of text files on your computer, there's a way in which like, oh, it feels much more simple to me.

**01:18:42** And I realized, like, yes, when I used to use org mode on E-Max, like that's what this thing was.

**01:18:47** You can like link to any other text file or you can quickly include some to do's.

**01:18:51** You can include your latex formatting if you want to.

**01:18:54** You can insert a calendar, but it's all done via text files.

**01:18:58** And that's the thing that Obsidian is doing.

**01:19:01** It's similar to Rome.

**01:19:03** It's similar to Notion.

**01:19:04** The key difference is that they're just doing it entirely through markdown files on your local drive.

**01:19:12** And it's like, oh, OK, cool.

**01:19:14** I get it.

**01:19:15** I've been using markdown to write my scripts for forever.

**01:19:19** So this is like no burden whatsoever to then also do a bunch of notes in markdown.

**01:19:24** And it means that like the transition between those two is ridiculously simple if I want information to go one way or the other.

**01:19:31** But so this is like a digital version of doing the index cards.

**01:19:37** And this is where like, oh, yeah, if you have an image that you want to use, like you can include it in just the way markdown format's including

**01:19:44** images. But ultimately, it's all just here's three hundred dot MD files on your on your hard drive that are just text files.

**01:19:52** And if you type double brackets, you can link from one to another, which is like the exact same thing that Rome does.

**01:19:58** Like if you're typing in Rome, you can open up two double brackets and you can link to any other one of the notes anywhere in your in your system.

**01:20:05** So does that answer your question of what happens if you have a picture?

**01:20:10** Kind of. I'm really lost looking at this obsidian app.

**01:20:13** I would not recommend obsidian for you, Mike.

**01:20:17** No, because I don't really understand like so you're creating.

**01:20:23** Where are you making notes?

**01:20:25** Well, again, for me, I'm still doing this almost entirely with paper as I'm figuring out what's useful.

**01:20:30** Right. I have played around with obsidian.

**01:20:34** But again, like just like we talk about what people are figuring out their to do systems,

**01:20:40** they're like, you don't want to prematurely optimize for the digital version because you're going to get too distracted by the features or lack of features of whatever digital tool.

**01:20:48** It's the same thing here.

**01:20:49** Like I just wanted to play around with obsidian to see, like, let me understand the concept of what this is in a digital form, which is you can have virtual index cards with virtual strings connecting related ones together.

**01:21:05** It's like, OK, cool.

**01:21:06** I understand that.

**01:21:08** And that also helped me understand this is very much like, you know, I mean, the reason I think you're feeling overwhelmed looking at it is it's very Linuxy, which is what made me think like, oh, yeah, this is just like org mode from a thousand years ago.

**01:21:22** So you can have this digital version, but it's just like the basic idea is for any project, you can have notes that are just individual pieces of information.

**01:21:32** Those pieces of information, because they're on index cards, are not constrained by your preconception of either like what is the hierarchy or what is the order of these notes that can that can come out of it later when you realize, oh, these three pieces of information are related or like these two pieces of information.

**01:21:55** I thought they were interesting and important at the start, but it turns out that they're actually irrelevant so I can put them at the back of the list.

**01:22:01** It's really just about the reordering layer.

**01:22:07** And again, I think why this feels like it's a useful step for me is because it's it feels like this pre-script layer where it's much easier to think about some of the information related to a topic without one reviewing the primary sources, even in their

**01:22:30** much compressed form or two, writing the script where there's also this additional layer of what is the style in which I'm saying this information, right?

**01:22:44** Because the script is not just a recitation of facts, right?

**01:22:47** No one would watch the videos if I was just like, here, let me tell you all the facts about the situation that has a whole other like, what is the style?

**01:22:56** How is this being told?

**01:22:57** Like, what are the visuals going to be?

**01:22:59** Like, that's an additional thing that I have to think about when doing that.

**01:23:02** So the notes layer feels like information organization without the burden of style and without the weight of the primary source.

**01:23:17** Right.

**01:23:17** That's that's the way I think this will work going forward.

**01:23:21** I feel like Rome is a good option for you from what I know about it.

**01:23:30** OK, why do you say that?

**01:23:31** Well, because it is all about like singular pieces of information that can very easily link together.

**01:23:39** And from what I know of Rome, it is available on the Web, on all devices.

**01:23:48** And my understanding is they are making apps for all platforms.

**01:23:52** My concern would be of an app like Obsidian is like Mac only, which I don't know if that's the right method.

**01:24:00** Oh, yeah. One hundred one hundred percent like no iOS app for Obsidian is the hugest downside.

**01:24:06** You know, one hundred percent.

**01:24:07** But again, this is why I'm not really invested in what is the digital tool at this stage.

**01:24:13** Yeah. I want to come back to that, though, like I really do.

**01:24:15** But yeah, but like the thing is I wanted to just play around with it because there is a way in which it can be briefly clarifying about like what do people mean when they're talking about linking notes?

**01:24:25** Oh, OK. I think that you had to start looking at some of these things like notion Rome Obsidian for you to be able to clarify the basic system.

**01:24:36** Right. Like I can see that of like, all right, you're like, all right.

**01:24:39** OK, so I'm not wild here.

**01:24:41** It is a valid way that people collect information.

**01:24:46** Right. And now you can go back to doing what you're doing now of like making sure that this basic structure makes sense to you.

**01:24:56** This has been a trip. Wow.

**01:25:03** You think you know someone.

**01:25:04** Well, I mean, again, this is where I really I really mean this thing of like my other drumbeat from being just a person who makes things on the Internet is the deep, deep realization that human communication is much harder than people think it is.

**01:25:22** Yeah. And one of the reasons is that human brains are much more different than people think they are.

**01:25:29** But they're also different in extremely subtle and hard to notice ways.

**01:25:37** And this can be one of these sorts of things where it's just like something that seems obvious to everyone can be non obvious for someone else or just because the way like one person's brain works like a thing that works for everyone doesn't work for them.

**01:25:52** Well, like we have been talking about notes apps for so many years, but never had we realized that we were doing this process in such vastly different ways.

**01:26:03** Yeah. Yeah. It casts back on the like every time you're talking about Evernote or note taking apps, like you realize like, oh, there's something else here.

**01:26:11** Right. That makes this conversation make a lot more sense, which is Gray thinks notes are like a Potemkin village of knowledge that schools

**01:26:21** require students create for inspectors and have no intrinsic value whatsoever.

**01:26:26** And grown ups who make notes are just repeating the behaviors from their childhood without understanding why they're doing it.

**01:26:34** Right. Just because you couldn't see the board.

**01:26:39** I still like I do still wonder like how on earth I made it so long without being able to see the board or realize it.

**01:26:45** That's the funny part to me. Right. Like it never came up.

**01:26:48** It just never came up. I do wonder sometimes because I think perhaps if I'm trying to recreate like how did this situation even begin in the first place, I do know like one of the most important gifts that my parents ever gave to me was when I was in middle school.

**01:27:02** They gave me this like course on how to memorize stuff.

**01:27:06** And I know we've talked about this sometimes.

**01:27:09** And like I remember in middle school just really devouring this set of tricks of how to remember things.

**01:27:17** And I've always just been aware of how that one thing got me through high school and college is like here's how to memorize things.

**01:27:27** And so I also just wonder is like is that a contributing factor to how I was able to get by with no one noticing I couldn't read the board is because I was like, oh, yeah, no.

**01:27:38** I've got this hack for the school system that just lets me pass these standardized tests.

**01:29:35** So do you remember last time we were talking about real time collaboration applications?

**01:29:39** You were looking for alternatives to Google Docs. That's what you were doing.

**01:29:43** Yeah, because we were upset about no doc mode and then I said to you, all right, let's try out Word, look out for an invitation from me.

**01:29:50** Oh yeah, and well, I haven't opened my email since then, but I assume that that invitation never came.

**01:29:54** It never got sent because Word didn't pass the initial testing for me.

**01:29:59** Okay.

**01:30:00** Basically, I spent a couple of days trying out lots of different applications.

**01:30:04** You know, like I tried Word, I tried pages, I tried like Notion for something like this.

**01:30:11** I tried Apple Notes. Effectively, the problem is none of them are as instant as Google Docs.

**01:30:17** And, you know, like I was just doing some simple testing with like, I would have Word open on my iPad and Word open on my Mac in the Mac app or in the web browser.

**01:30:28** And the issue would be that it would update the information, but not immediately.

**01:30:34** It would kind of like you could basically watch the system do it.

**01:30:38** Like you would start typing a bunch of stuff. You would stop.

**01:30:41** You would see like saving. And then a couple of seconds later, it would appear in the other place.

**01:30:45** Right.

**01:30:46** And like that is not what I want.

**01:30:48** And then so I was doing these tests in between the time of like us recording and releasing the episode.

**01:30:54** And honestly, by the time we'd released the episode, I realized that both Word pages and everything else, none of them were as good as Google Docs.

**01:31:01** Then I started hearing from all the cortex and who were like, please, please don't use Word.

**01:31:06** I have lost so much work through the collaboration system because it's conflict.

**01:31:11** Right.

**01:31:11** Like this is the thing that we were talking about.

**01:31:13** It's like it's conflict.

**01:31:15** Also, like, you know, there were people that were saying to me like, oh, Word has a dark mode as well, but it doesn't have a dark mode.

**01:31:23** Like the UI goes dark, but the page is still white.

**01:31:27** And then there were people that were telling me, oh, all you have to do is change the page to a black background and the text to white.

**01:31:32** No, that's not a dark mode.

**01:31:33** That's not a dark mode.

**01:31:34** Right.

**01:31:34** Like that's you making changes that you'll eventually like when you're on an app system that has light mode and then it won't make any sense because the page is black.

**01:31:43** Yeah, I hate those pseudo dark modes so much.

**01:31:46** I was really pumped because Apple recently released a dark mode for numbers, their spreadsheet program that I use so much.

**01:31:53** I was like, oh, finally, like dark mode for spreadsheets.

**01:31:57** Now the spreadsheets are just as white as they ever were.

**01:31:59** Yeah, just so the UI chronics dark.

**01:32:01** Which is just, that's not, you know, it's not helpful.

**01:32:04** Like email apps are fine, you know, like you just inverts the text color, but it's not like everybody's getting emails that are just white text.

**01:32:11** Right.

**01:32:11** Because that's no good.

**01:32:13** So basically there's a long version of this, but I don't think it's worth necessarily going into at this point.

**01:32:20** The short version is I've come to conclude that real time collaboration for me is more important than the native OS features that I want.

**01:32:28** Right.

**01:32:29** Because the most important thing that goes into these documents is the text and the text has to be correct for everyone.

**01:32:36** And if it isn't, then what was the point and even starting the document in the first place?

**01:32:41** Like if real time collaboration was not as important, like if all I wanted was just to have like the most native features, I probably just use Apple notes for everything.

**01:32:51** Right.

**01:32:51** Like that's the decision I kind of come to is like, that's an application that's always going to be up to date with a system.

**01:32:56** It has good hooks in the system and I love it.

**01:32:58** I use it for so much stuff.

**01:33:00** But the problem is like you have to wait for people's stuff to get synced in.

**01:33:05** And then the other issue that I was finding is that all of the new pieces of software that people are creating, like in the vein of a Google Docs, like a kind of a word based solution, they want to be everything.

**01:33:16** They want to be Docs and sheets and chat and tasks and everything and everything and everything and everything.

**01:33:22** Right.

**01:33:23** And that's also not what I want.

**01:33:24** Like I want a focused product.

**01:33:27** So I think I'm basically back in the place that I end up being once every year or two.

**01:33:34** Google Docs is the best at what Google Docs does.

**01:33:37** Yeah.

**01:33:37** And I just have to hope that Google will update it to be what I want it to be.

**01:33:41** I'm sorry that your, your journey into real time collaboration apps was, was less of a, less of a March and more of just a circle right back to where you started.

**01:33:51** In like two days.

**01:33:53** It really, it really didn't take very long.

**01:33:55** At least it was a short circle then.

**01:33:57** It wasn't a long circle.

**01:33:58** That's true.

**01:33:59** Okay.

**01:33:59** I didn't have to do a lot of work to come to this decision, but I just, I've come to really rely and value what Google Docs does.

**01:34:09** And it's the best at what it does fundamentally.

**01:34:14** So I mentioned that now was a busy time for me, right?

**01:34:17** Like a lot going on right now.

**01:34:20** And the big project that I have on my horizon is the podcast-a-thon podcast-a-thon two.

**01:34:27** Oh, podcast-a-thon two.

**01:34:29** Yep.

**01:34:29** Electra Boogaloo.

**01:34:30** Indeed.

**01:34:31** Listeners may remember that last year we raised a ton of money.

**01:34:36** It was an incredible thing for St. Jude Children's Cancer Research Hospital.

**01:34:40** And I'm going to be talking a little bit more about this on our next episode, but we are fundraising again, starting now and throughout September.

**01:34:48** If you go to stjude.org slash relay, you can give money there.

**01:34:52** It would be incredible for you to support the cause.

**01:34:55** We had such an incredible showing last year.

**01:34:57** We raised over $300,000, which was just absolutely unbelievable.

**01:35:02** Blew us all away.

**01:35:04** And we want to do it again.

**01:35:05** We want to raise that money again because, you know, these are, it's difficult, right?

**01:35:09** Everything's difficult for everyone right now, but that doesn't mean that this is the thing that we also can't continue to think about.

**01:35:16** And we should.

**01:35:17** Like St.

**01:35:18** Jude is such an incredible place.

**01:35:20** Like they do such incredible work.

**01:35:22** The treatments that have been invented at St.

**01:35:24** Jude, they've helped push the child cancer survival rate from 20% to more than 80% in its 50 years of being around.

**01:35:33** And so supporting this charity, like their mission is to make sure that no child dies from cancer.

**01:35:41** And I think they can do that.

**01:35:43** Right.

**01:35:43** Like they've, they've done such incredible things over 50 years.

**01:35:47** We want to continue to support their work.

**01:35:50** So if you go to st.

**01:35:51** Jude dot org slash relay, you can donate whatever you can.

**01:35:55** We'll go a long way to helping this wonderful institution and the children that they take care of.

**01:36:03** And this isn't a charity that is just an American charity.

**01:36:07** They, they, they help people from all over the world.

**01:36:09** And the research from St.

**01:36:11** Jude has helped with medicine worldwide.

**01:36:15** So it is a really, really incredible place.

**01:36:17** It does incredible things.

**01:36:19** So say I want to talk more in detail about St.

**01:36:21** Jude on our next episode, because that is, will be in September and it's, that is when

**01:36:26** childhood cancer awareness month is, but also in September is podcastathon two.

**01:36:31** It's going to be on September 18th from two to 8pm Eastern twitch.tv slash relay FM.

**01:36:37** Again, I will talk about that more.

**01:36:39** I will remind everybody in our next episode about that.

**01:36:42** But the big thing, the big thing that's taking up my time right now is that this is

**01:36:47** an all remote podcastathon.

**01:36:49** You're not all getting together in, uh, in Tennessee again.

**01:36:52** No, not happening.

**01:36:53** It's like last year we did everything in Memphis, Tennessee, that at the St.

**01:36:57** Jude campus, they have these incredible production facilities there.

**01:37:01** And I mean, I can't be there.

**01:37:03** So currently at the moment, a big project is getting mega studio set for this event.

**01:37:12** Oh, right.

**01:37:12** You're going to need filming as well.

**01:37:14** Right.

**01:37:14** Like it's all video.

**01:37:15** You want to look good on camera.

**01:37:17** So I have my one person production crew of Adina right now, and we are making it happen.

**01:37:24** We're setting up sets.

**01:37:25** We're getting some lights.

**01:37:27** We're getting tripods and yeah, there's, there's a lot going on and it's the

**01:37:32** big, it's a big project for everyone right now, because as well as coming up with the

**01:37:37** content that we want to put into the event, it's like just the basics.

**01:37:41** You know, when we started the planning for podcastathon two, it was like, all right, how

**01:37:46** can we make this bigger and better and focus on the content?

**01:37:49** So we started doing that.

**01:37:50** And now we have the sub project of, okay, now we need to rework all the logistics as

**01:37:55** well.

**01:37:55** So, right.

**01:37:56** Right.

**01:37:56** So it's a bigger project.

**01:37:58** I mean, I'm really pleased.

**01:37:59** This is the second one we've done because if it was the first one, it would have been

**01:38:03** infinitely harder because now we've been able to learn from last year.

**01:38:07** And you know, like I genuinely think that the remoteness of it is not going to affect it.

**01:38:13** Like the only difference is me and Steven are not in the same place because every guest we

**01:38:18** had last year, well, not, but many of the guests we had last year were remote guests.

**01:38:23** Yeah.

**01:38:23** It's really lucky that you were able to do with Steven in person the first time.

**01:38:28** That makes a huge difference for trying to do it all remote the second time, for sure.

**01:38:32** Yeah.

**01:38:32** So we've learned from it and we have an incredible team at St.

**01:38:36** Jude and Alsack to help us put it on.

**01:38:39** Like they've given us access to lots of incredible resources.

**01:38:43** So I'm really excited about it, but I'm also like super nervous about it because it's a,

**01:38:48** it's a big job like for us to get this studio ready for that.

**01:38:54** Like it's, it was never made for that.

**01:38:57** Right.

**01:38:57** So like we're currently setting up sets effectively, like locations, like fixed

**01:39:03** locations in the studio.

**01:39:04** Wait, what do you mean?

**01:39:05** Like sets of locations?

**01:39:07** Like are you going to transition to, oh, this is, this is Mike by the fireside kind of

**01:39:11** set?

**01:39:11** Like pretty much.

**01:39:12** Yes.

**01:39:13** So we're going to have three locations in the studio.

**01:39:16** Like one is like a relaxed location.

**01:39:20** One is a behind the desk location and one is a secret location that I won't reveal just yet.

**01:39:27** Okay.

**01:39:27** Cause we're setting up something which is in scope, maybe a little more than we should do.

**01:39:33** But if we are able to execute it and I believe that we will, will be incredibly fun.

**01:39:39** So it's a big project and like, I'm super happy that I have a Dean as time for this.

**01:39:45** Like she's basically pushing everything to decide to do this.

**01:39:48** Cause there's no way I could do this on my own.

**01:39:51** Like even just like getting the basic equipment that we need is a huge task because like you try and find a good light right now.

**01:40:00** Yeah.

**01:40:00** I was going to say, do you have those, uh, those fancy, like, I don't know what they're called the things that you use to bounce the light off of so you can look, you know, really great on camera.

**01:40:08** I don't think I've gone to that level.

**01:40:09** I mean, the bounce shields, I don't know.

**01:40:12** Yeah, bounce shields.

**01:40:12** That's what I call it in the, in the biz.

**01:40:14** Uh, you know, like it is stuff like, um, and it is a great product, like the Elgato key light.

**01:40:20** All the streamers use these lights.

**01:40:22** Fantastic.

**01:40:23** I've been able to get a couple of them.

**01:40:24** This is more of your RGB nonsense.

**01:40:26** Is that what you're talking about?

**01:40:27** It's just a pure light.

**01:40:29** There's no RGB on this one, but it is.

**01:40:31** It's something that all the game streamers use, but yeah, it's like, this is an interesting task to tackle because this is not my world.

**01:40:41** Um, uh, but it's something that we are getting a handle of during the fundraising process between now and September 18th.

**01:40:50** Like we're raising money all through September, but obviously we want to have a, like a, like a lead up to the podcast.

**01:40:56** Like we're going to be doing other Twitch streams and this is all like testing of the setups, right?

**01:41:02** So we can make sure that like we have the basics ready before we have to commit eight hours, you know?

**01:41:09** Right.

**01:41:09** Yeah.

**01:41:10** Yeah.

**01:41:10** That's not when you want to find out how difficult it is to switch between sets is when you're going to do something live for eight hours.

**01:41:17** Exactly.

**01:41:17** Like, and so it's even like one thing where I've already realized like, oh, okay, I found a great tripod.

**01:41:23** I need two of these.

**01:41:24** Right.

**01:41:25** And so like, I've got this like car we bought from Ikea that has like a small tripod on it.

**01:41:32** The laptop that I'm going to be using the light and gear, right.

**01:41:36** I need in if I'm good, because then basically we're moving this car around to the different parts of the studio, right?

**01:41:43** So it's all in a fixed location.

**01:41:45** But what I've learned is for two of the locations, it will be better if I can just pop the camera off and put it onto a tripod, which is on the ground rather than on the car.

**01:41:54** So like this is the benefit of doing these smaller tests of trying to work out what this environment will be good for.

**01:42:03** And there's like two things, which is like benefits.

**01:42:06** One, I'm pleased we didn't have this place entirely furnished because we would not have the space to do what we want to do.

**01:42:12** Right.

**01:42:12** Right.

**01:42:12** Yeah.

**01:42:12** You didn't know that surprise you need to build three filming sets in mega studio.

**01:42:18** And two, it's helping us accelerate the furnishing process because the stuff that we need for this.

**01:42:25** So yeah, it's, this is a very interesting task to undertake, but I am very excited.

**01:42:33** About it.

**01:42:33** And it's I couldn't find a better cause to do it for.

**01:42:36** So call Texans do us proud.

**01:42:39** Go to St. Jude dot org slash relay and donate now.

**01:42:42** Get ready for the podcastathon and I'll be talking about it a little bit more next time.

**01:42:47** So as is usual for us, I had like a million more things that I wanted to talk about today that we're going to have to push to a later episode because I was not expecting what was your quote mini topic in the episode of reassessing your note taking to be an absolute.

**01:43:03** Fundamental rebuild what it takes to make a note.

**01:43:06** Yeah.

**01:43:07** No, I'm sorry.

**01:43:08** I didn't mean to totally blow your plans.

**01:43:10** Like I thought that was a nice, that might be a nice pre-show thing.

**01:43:15** As I've said many times, there's two great things about us having more.

**01:43:18** Like I have work already done for next time and two, it gives us stuff to talk about in more tax as well.

**01:43:25** Yes, that's true.

**01:43:26** But before we go today, it's August and around these parts, August means text adventure.

**01:43:33** Text adventure time.

**01:43:35** And we have another one.

**01:43:36** So on August 29th, the upgrade cortex crossover text adventure for this year will be published for relay FM members.

**01:43:44** All relay FM members get access to this.

**01:43:47** So if you subscribe to more tax or you subscribe to another show, there is a fee called relay FM crossover, which is where all of the bonus content is posted.

**01:43:56** I'm going to put a link in the show notes.

**01:43:57** So if you're a member and you don't have the crossover feed, you can just click that and it will take you where you need to go to sign up for it.

**01:44:03** But this is a great time if you're not a relay FM member to try out more tax.

**01:44:08** Because if you go to get more text dot com, you can sign up for five dollars a month and you will get more tax and you will also get the crossover feed that includes the text adventure special.

**01:44:19** So you can give it a go and see what you're missing out by not getting more tax.

**01:44:23** It's going to be a trailer at the end of this episode.

**01:44:25** So you can hear the theme of this year's text adventure.

**01:44:29** So I'll play that for you.

**01:44:30** If you're not a member, you need to become one to get access to this.

**01:44:33** Go to get more text dot com.

**01:44:35** You can sign up.

**01:44:36** You'll be able to get the more text feed and the crossover feed that will include the text adventure for you.

**01:44:41** And don't forget more text is longer ad free episodes of cortex.

**01:44:46** So go check it out right now.

**01:44:48** Get more text dot com.

**01:44:50** Get more text dot com.

**01:44:52** Mike Gray, welcome to Z war.

**01:45:01** Oh, oh, oh, no, it's a zombie.

**01:45:05** Oh, no.

**01:45:09** You're at the hospital entrance.

**01:45:11** You're outside the hospital where your sister was admitted nine weeks ago.

**01:45:15** You may enter to the north.

**01:45:17** The hospital grounds continue east.

**01:45:19** OK, I've already got to redo my map.

**01:45:21** OK, wait a second.

**01:45:23** Didn't last very long.

**01:45:25** You read the poorly spelled email you received this morning from your sister.

**01:45:31** Halp zombie apocalypse.

**01:45:35** Exo Exo Francis.

**01:45:37** Looks like you're right, Mike.

**01:45:38** It's zombie time.

**01:45:40** The only real piece of information that we need is what kind of zombies are we dealing with here?

**01:45:45** Are they like zombies, zombies or are they 28 days later?

**01:45:49** Zombies, if they're zombies, zombies, zombies aren't that big of a problem.

**01:45:54** I'm hoping it's zombie zombies.

**01:45:58** You have a fire extinguisher.

**01:46:00** If we have to use this fire extinguisher to extinguish a fire, I'm going to be very disappointed.

**01:46:05** It turns out this is just a lesson in fire safety.

**01:46:08** This whole thing, I guess typical style.

**01:46:10** We check this floor, right?

**01:46:12** Like, let's not leave the floor.

**01:46:14** Mike, you and I, we're like a we're like a SWAT team here.

**01:46:16** We're going to cover our corners and we're going to take it floor by floor.

**01:46:20** Without fire extinguisher, just like a good SWAT team.

**01:46:24** The theater is filled with the shuffling bodies of zombified patients and staff members.

**01:46:29** There are too many zombies here to fight upon seeing you.

**01:46:32** They become agitated and start to close in.

**01:46:35** Get out, close the door, close the door.

**01:46:37** Don't dead open inside.

**01:46:39** Reference acknowledged.

**01:46:41** Zombies begin to enter the kitchen.

**01:46:43** We're f***ing this round.

**01:46:44** We shouldn't have opened that door, huh?

**01:46:46** The zombies attack you and bite you and kill you and you die.

**01:46:48** The end. All right.

**01:46:49** OK.

**01:46:52** You open the heavy door and find a chef.

**01:46:55** Say hello.

**01:46:56** She says you didn't eat anything, did you?

**01:46:58** The chief of staff told me to add vitamin Z to the meatloaf.

**01:47:02** After that, everything just went to hell.

**01:47:06** No, no, I'm going to turn the dial.

**01:47:08** OK, but what I'm saying is that we need to do that right now.

**01:47:11** You have no sense of exploration, Mike.

**01:47:14** You guys may not remember the past text adventures, but we've had this conversation before.

**01:47:20** Set dial to high.

**01:47:22** The machine hums and the zombie thrashes around, but something goes wrong.

**01:47:26** The machine starts to smoke and the electrodes catch fire.

**01:47:29** The zombies eyes burst from their sockets and the power goes out.

**01:47:32** Are we in darkness?

**01:47:33** I can't see anything. It's dark.

**01:47:36** I guess this is where we use the bullet on ourselves and start over.

**01:47:42** Or you could just, you know, load your save.

**01:47:48** You managed to escape Z word with your life, but you'll never forgive yourself

**01:47:51** for the loss of your sister.

**01:47:52** The end. Boo.

**01:47:55** OK, OK. All right.

**01:47:56** Reload. Save slot two.
