# Cortex - 99: Epi5ode Out of Time
**00:00:00** This episode of Cortex is brought to you by Indeed.

**00:00:03** Okay, let's go.

**00:00:04** Let's rock and roll.

**00:00:05** Episode two.

**00:00:07** So I don't need to do levels levels for this episode

**00:00:10** because we're recording this episode

**00:00:13** directly after the previous episode.

**00:00:16** Yeah.

**00:00:17** Well, we've taken a 45 minute break for refueling,

**00:00:20** but we are straight back into it

**00:00:22** because obviously this is now an episode out of time.

**00:00:25** Right.

**00:00:26** This is an episode out of time five.

**00:00:28** Okay.

**00:00:29** I'd like to petition this one to be called episode,

**00:00:31** but replace S with a five.

**00:00:34** So it's episode out of time,

**00:00:36** Epi Five, the old out of time, you know?

**00:00:38** Epi Five-Oed out of time?

**00:00:40** Yeah, well, you still set his episode.

**00:00:41** Why do you say it episode?

**00:00:42** I don't know if you are familiar

**00:00:43** with the Fast and Furious franchise.

**00:00:46** You take one wild guess, Mike.

**00:00:48** Okay.

**00:00:51** You've definitely heard of it.

**00:00:52** I'm a super fan.

**00:00:53** I love, I've seen every single one.

**00:00:55** Are you being serious?

**00:00:56** I love them.

**00:00:57** Yeah, yeah.

**00:00:58** You've got The Rock and Cars.

**00:00:59** Well, they do now.

**00:01:00** What more could you want?

**00:01:02** Okay.

**00:01:03** Well, that's...

**00:01:03** So, but why do you pronounce episode

**00:01:06** with a five as episode?

**00:01:08** Because this is a thing in these types of movies

**00:01:12** where they start hiding the numbers inside of the name.

**00:01:17** It's not really hidden though.

**00:01:19** Right, but like, as in it's not the episode out of time five.

**00:01:21** The five is still there,

**00:01:22** but it's like put inside something else.

**00:01:24** Okay.

**00:01:25** Anyway, I think they did this at some point.

**00:01:27** Oh yeah, Too Fast Too Furious.

**00:01:28** Okay.

**00:01:29** They used the number two instead of the word two.

**00:01:32** This is like fan four stick,

**00:01:33** the Fantastic Four movie with the four in the middle of it.

**00:01:35** All of that stuff, yes.

**00:01:36** That is the thing that I'm going for.

**00:01:38** But in general, I'm going for like

**00:01:40** Fast and Furious type naming with these.

**00:01:42** Okay, sure.

**00:01:43** So I think maybe like the next one,

**00:01:45** we like reboot the entire show.

**00:01:48** Cause I think that's what happens.

**00:01:49** Like at some point.

**00:01:50** Well, I think Fast Five,

**00:01:52** which is where we're at kind of now in the lore, I guess.

**00:01:54** I think this is when The Rock joins.

**00:01:56** No, Fast and Furious six is just Fast and Furious six.

**00:01:59** They don't try to hide it, right?

**00:02:01** They're not like,

**00:02:02** Right.

**00:02:02** Thick sticks and Furious six, right?

**00:02:05** They don't do anything like that.

**00:02:06** You'll be super upset to know then

**00:02:08** that because of coronavirus,

**00:02:09** they've pushed for F9 11 months.

**00:02:13** Oh, okay.

**00:02:14** It was supposed to come out in May this year.

**00:02:17** Right.

**00:02:18** And it's now gonna come out in April, 2021.

**00:02:20** I don't understand.

**00:02:21** I need continuing plot threads for Shaw

**00:02:24** and you know, what's going on with him.

**00:02:26** My mind is blown right now.

**00:02:28** And I genuinely, I'm not sure if you're being serious or not.

**00:02:32** I don't know why I would ever,

**00:02:34** I don't know why I would mess with you

**00:02:35** on this kind of thing.

**00:02:36** Like that's not what I would do.

**00:02:38** But anyway, like that seems ridiculous

**00:02:40** that they're pushing it back that much

**00:02:41** as a fantastic head, as we're called.

**00:02:44** Fast, a fast head.

**00:02:46** I demand.

**00:02:48** I demand.

**00:02:49** The Fast and Furious community is up in arms.

**00:02:52** I don't even understand.

**00:02:53** Have they not finished filming?

**00:02:55** No, it's done.

**00:02:56** It was coming out in May.

**00:02:57** Oh, okay.

**00:02:58** So, but so like they haven't run across like,

**00:03:00** oh, Gal Gadot is filming schedule.

**00:03:02** Is it lining up?

**00:03:03** They've just decided to move it

**00:03:05** because no one's going to the cinema right now.

**00:03:07** Oh.

**00:03:08** Like some of the movies have been moved

**00:03:10** to later in the year.

**00:03:11** So like the new James Bond movie got moved to November.

**00:03:13** Right.

**00:03:14** It was supposed to come out in April,

**00:03:15** but it was kind of funny because in the announcement,

**00:03:17** they're like, we decided to just like slightly delay

**00:03:20** the movie.

**00:03:21** It will now be coming out in 11 months,

**00:03:23** which seems like, you know, they really,

**00:03:26** obviously they know that for whatever reason,

**00:03:28** April, May is the best time for a Fast and Furious movie

**00:03:31** to come out.

**00:03:32** So they're not going to move it to the holidays

**00:03:34** because that's not obviously when they feel

**00:03:35** these movies are good.

**00:03:37** So they're going to push it all the way back around again.

**00:03:39** And they're probably just trying to avoid Marvel

**00:03:41** and stuff like that would be my expectation.

**00:03:43** Right, right.

**00:03:44** Okay.

**00:03:45** All right.

**00:03:46** That makes sense.

**00:03:47** Like I'm sitting here like a total dummy

**00:03:48** thinking it was something with the production,

**00:03:50** but no, of course it's the fact that we can't have people

**00:03:52** in movie theaters because there's a pandemic.

**00:03:55** It just, because we're still recording on the actual day

**00:03:58** that we recorded the last episode, it's a little bit of,

**00:04:02** as we were discussing before that episode,

**00:04:04** still thinking we're just in the timeframe

**00:04:07** when people have act like the general population

**00:04:09** has become concerned about this.

**00:04:12** And so anything could have happened

**00:04:14** by the time this episode comes out.

**00:04:16** Anything could have happened by the time this comes out,

**00:04:17** but also even for me, my brain is still not quite processing.

**00:04:21** Why are you delaying your movie?

**00:04:23** Oh, right.

**00:04:24** Because movie theaters are not a thing.

**00:04:27** They don't go to them.

**00:04:28** But anyway, episode out five.

**00:04:30** Wait, episode out of time five.

**00:04:32** No, keep it straight.

**00:04:33** I'm hitting the five in the wrong place.

**00:04:35** Epified out of time.

**00:04:37** That's the episode that we're doing today.

**00:04:40** Cortexmerch.com.

**00:04:42** Cortexmerch.com.

**00:04:45** Oh no, that was a good one.

**00:04:47** I like that one.

**00:04:48** We are doing much for one specific reason,

**00:04:51** and then we also had another good idea.

**00:04:53** This is episode 99 of Cortex.

**00:04:56** Which is-

**00:04:57** Can you believe it?

**00:04:58** We've done so many of these.

**00:04:59** As I just said that, I couldn't believe it.

**00:05:01** So our next episode is gonna be episode 100.

**00:05:05** So on sale right now at cortexmerch.com,

**00:05:08** a 100th episode commemorative t-shirt.

**00:05:12** It is my favorite t-shirt design

**00:05:14** that we have ever come up with.

**00:05:16** Our designer, Simon, completely knocked it out of the park.

**00:05:19** It is a Cortex logo that looks like an app,

**00:05:21** and it has an unread badge of 100, which is so, so good.

**00:05:26** It's perfect.

**00:05:27** I have to say Simon always does great work,

**00:05:30** but this one in particular,

**00:05:32** I think I have never had a shorter amount of time

**00:05:35** between how long did it take my brain

**00:05:38** to visually process what I'm looking at for a t-shirt design

**00:05:41** and how fast was I like, double thumbs up, I love this.

**00:05:45** Like it's just instantly legible and I totally love it.

**00:05:49** It's such a great idea

**00:05:50** for the commemorative 100 episode t-shirt.

**00:05:54** It's absolutely perfect.

**00:05:55** It's absolutely perfect.

**00:05:56** And we loved it so much that we're gonna offer this one

**00:06:00** in a couple of different things.

**00:06:01** So we're doing the regular t-shirt.

**00:06:03** We also have a Cortex 100 episode commemorative t-pro,

**00:06:07** which is a mega special foil printed version.

**00:06:11** So the unread badge, the red unread badge

**00:06:14** is going to be printed in foil.

**00:06:16** It is more of an expensive item.

**00:06:17** We've done this before.

**00:06:18** We had a gold leaf version, a gold foil version of a t-shirt.

**00:06:24** Just to be clear, just to be clear,

**00:06:26** if you have the gold Cortex shirts, it's not gold leaf.

**00:06:30** It's just gold foil.

**00:06:34** 24 karat gold.

**00:06:36** I love wearing that one.

**00:06:37** I have one of those and I like it very much.

**00:06:40** But yeah, that is a more expensive version

**00:06:42** because it's getting much, much more complicated

**00:06:45** printing method.

**00:06:45** There's a reason pro stuff is more expensive.

**00:06:48** This is because it's made with shiny red gold foil.

**00:06:51** Exactly.

**00:06:52** It's amazing.

**00:06:54** We're also doing stickers.

**00:06:55** I don't think we've ever sold stickers before,

**00:06:57** but again, I like this artwork so much

**00:06:59** that I thought it should live in a few different ways.

**00:07:00** So you can get a two pack of some stickers.

**00:07:02** Those are limited though.

**00:07:04** So the t-shirts we're doing,

**00:07:05** the typical pre-order that we do with t-shirts.

**00:07:07** So we'll make as many as we sell,

**00:07:09** but we have a limited amount of the stickers.

**00:07:12** So just as an FYI.

**00:07:13** So if you like the sticker, don't wait, get it.

**00:07:15** And then we also have something

**00:07:17** I'm very excited about.

**00:07:18** It seemed inevitable at this point,

**00:07:20** a levels levels t-shirt.

**00:07:22** Look at who's come around to levels levels.

**00:07:24** That's you, Mike.

**00:07:25** Levels levels is amazing and it deserves to be a t-shirt.

**00:07:29** I don't think I ever had a problem with levels levels.

**00:07:32** I think it was just surprising.

**00:07:35** It was just the surprising thing to come across,

**00:07:38** but I have standardized now that that is the way

**00:07:40** that podcasts should greet each other.

**00:07:42** So yeah, we have a levels levels t-shirt

**00:07:44** in a variety of wonderful colors.

**00:07:47** You can see all of these and buy all of these right now,

**00:07:49** cloretexmerch.com.

**00:07:51** These are only available for two weeks.

**00:07:53** We won't be reminding you again.

**00:07:55** So if you wanna go get them, go get them.

**00:07:57** The sale will be over of these shirts

**00:07:59** before our 100th episode.

**00:08:01** So maybe some of you might even have,

**00:08:03** they might be on the way to you

**00:08:04** by the time our episode comes out, you know,

**00:08:06** or you could just wait a little bit, get your t-shirt,

**00:08:08** put your t-shirt on the listen to episode 100,

**00:08:11** which I can't believe we're approaching.

**00:08:13** I know.

**00:08:14** So many cortex episodes, Mike.

**00:08:16** The number is so, it's so hot.

**00:08:18** The number is large.

**00:08:19** I'm not even sure there's any other podcast

**00:08:21** that has a number as big as 100.

**00:08:23** It's just like a shocking-

**00:08:24** I just recorded episode 400 of the pan addict

**00:08:28** like two weeks ago.

**00:08:31** Do you know though, Gray, like we are just a couple

**00:08:33** of months away from having worked on this project

**00:08:36** for five years.

**00:08:38** Really?

**00:08:39** Yeah.

**00:08:40** That's a long time.

**00:08:41** 2015 was our first episode.

**00:08:44** Oh my God.

**00:08:46** That was a different man back then.

**00:08:48** We both were.

**00:08:49** Yeah.

**00:08:50** Who were the people who started this show?

**00:08:52** We don't even know them anymore.

**00:08:54** They're past us.

**00:08:55** And now here we are continuing the path of life,

**00:08:59** always becoming a new person,

**00:09:01** discarding the old person.

**00:09:03** Still talking to Mike each week.

**00:09:04** On that note, cortexmerch.com.

**00:09:07** All right, so we promised Cortex Movie Club

**00:09:12** for this episode.

**00:09:14** And we are going to be talking about Inside Bill's Brain,

**00:09:17** a three-part documentary series on Netflix,

**00:09:20** talking about Bill Gates.

**00:09:22** The episodes are kind of broken down

**00:09:24** into three little stories,

**00:09:26** and they tell different things

**00:09:28** that the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation are up to,

**00:09:30** and also kind of refer those back to Bill's history.

**00:09:34** This is the first time you've seen it, right?

**00:09:36** Yeah, so I watched it last night.

**00:09:38** I still just sat down and watched the whole thing in a row.

**00:09:41** Very watchable as a single thing.

**00:09:43** Like, I don't think they even need

**00:09:44** to really divide it up into episodes.

**00:09:47** I mean, it's just Netflix, right?

**00:09:48** They know you're watching it all in one go.

**00:09:50** Yeah, but that's also partly why I feel like,

**00:09:52** who are we kidding, Netflix, right?

**00:09:56** What do you think I'm doing?

**00:09:57** Watching this one episode a week?

**00:09:59** Like, let's get real.

**00:10:00** Just make it one thing.

**00:10:01** It was easy to binge.

**00:10:02** It flows from the start to the finish.

**00:10:05** It's really well made.

**00:10:06** It's incredibly well made,

**00:10:07** and it's very cleverly made as well.

**00:10:09** The second episode, I think, is the best episode

**00:10:12** from a narrative perspective.

**00:10:14** That's when they're focusing on the polio vaccine

**00:10:18** and talking about his history,

**00:10:20** and they overlap the problems, right?

**00:10:23** So like him trying to isolate and work out

**00:10:26** and calculate where to put the vaccine,

**00:10:29** and then also calculating how to do the school schedules.

**00:10:32** And they just overlap the conversations,

**00:10:35** and it's fascinating.

**00:10:36** It's so well done.

**00:10:38** I think it's difficult to not have a lot of respect

**00:10:40** for Bill Gates, right?

**00:10:42** Like, I don't know anybody who cares about technology

**00:10:47** that does not respect Bill Gates as an individual,

**00:10:49** like in his contribution.

**00:10:51** But this gave me even more so for him, you know?

**00:10:55** Like, really seeing in detail

**00:11:00** the work that the foundation is doing,

**00:11:02** it was really enlightening to me.

**00:11:06** And I came away from it feeling even warmer

**00:11:10** about Bill Gates than before.

**00:11:13** Yeah, it's interesting because I was thinking

**00:11:15** before watching the documentary last night that,

**00:11:19** it's like just trying to think about my history of Bill Gates,

**00:11:21** of like, what have I thought about this person?

**00:11:24** Because he's been a large figure

**00:11:27** on the technological landscape for the course of my life.

**00:11:30** And it's funny because just trying to think about

**00:11:33** what were the phases of my thoughts about him.

**00:11:36** And I remember sort of early in my computing use time,

**00:11:42** having this feeling like, oh, computers are crazy,

**00:11:46** and we need someone to come in here

**00:11:48** and totally unify this system.

**00:11:51** That like, oh, if we have all these wildly different

**00:11:53** working computers, what a big problem this is.

**00:11:56** And we just like, we need a dominant market player here

**00:11:59** to make everything work together

**00:12:01** so that all these computers can be great.

**00:12:03** And then years later, I became embarrassingly,

**00:12:06** when I was using Linux, one of these people

**00:12:08** who would like write Microsoft with the dollar sign.

**00:12:12** I know, right?

**00:12:13** Like, I know I did that a couple of times on bulletin boards

**00:12:17** and it's like, oh God, passed me.

**00:12:19** Like, I can't roll my eyes hard enough at that person.

**00:12:23** If I'm writing notes, like sometimes like very fast,

**00:12:27** I will do M dollar sign for Microsoft.

**00:12:30** Yeah, but that's like an abbreviation, right?

**00:12:32** Not an embarrassment.

**00:12:34** But that abbreviation comes from terrible nerds like you

**00:12:37** who wrote Microsoft with the dollar sign, right?

**00:12:40** Like that's how I know about that.

**00:12:42** Yeah, and looking back on it, it's just funny

**00:12:45** because, you know, again, like that's the height

**00:12:49** of my insufferable Linux userness.

**00:12:52** And I also love it because it's the kind of thing

**00:12:55** that in retrospect, betrays a total edgy lack

**00:12:59** of understanding anything about the world, right?

**00:13:02** Like, I think that's the kind of a thing

**00:13:04** when you're younger and you're like, oh my God,

**00:13:07** did you know that this business is trying to make money?

**00:13:11** And it's like, oh God, kid.

**00:13:12** And they wanna be the best.

**00:13:14** Yeah, yeah, and it's like, kid,

**00:13:16** I don't even know where to start with this, right?

**00:13:20** Like I get why you're angry

**00:13:22** and why you and a bunch of Linux hippies

**00:13:24** wanna build an operating system made out of flowers together.

**00:13:27** And it's like, it's great,

**00:13:28** but also Jesus Christ is that embarrassing.

**00:15:35** So that was at one point in my life,

**00:15:36** and then I knew that he started this charity

**00:15:40** that was focused on the third world,

**00:15:43** and I remember just thinking like,

**00:15:46** what an odd choice, like he made all of his money

**00:15:49** from the first world, and now he's spending

**00:15:51** all his money in the third world.

**00:15:53** And at some point, like between learning about

**00:15:58** the foundation and then like fast forward a decade

**00:16:02** of just hearing about Bill Gates in the background

**00:16:05** in these various ways, I totally changed my mind

**00:16:09** on him as a person.

**00:16:10** I just think it's an interesting case of,

**00:16:13** like I was one of these people who at a time

**00:16:16** thought like, oh, Bill Gates is this terrible person.

**00:16:18** And the documentary goes over the course of his life,

**00:16:22** and without a doubt, he was an abrasive guy

**00:16:26** when he was younger, but there's also just this way

**00:16:29** in which people change or you can have incorrect

**00:16:32** assessments of that person.

**00:16:35** And I've gone from thinking Bill Gates

**00:16:38** is this terrible person to, I think my current status

**00:16:42** is if you have to try to make a short list

**00:16:46** of who of the humans on Earth are trying and succeeding

**00:16:51** to make the world a place with less suffering in it,

**00:16:55** it's like, Bill Gates has gotta be pretty high

**00:16:57** on that list of like, how many people are actually

**00:17:01** doing and accomplishing things that produce

**00:17:03** the suffering of humanity.

**00:17:05** And it's not necessarily that he cares more

**00:17:08** than anybody else, it's that he is doing it.

**00:17:12** And he has the resources to do it, right?

**00:17:14** Like that's why, like he has so much money,

**00:17:17** but lots of people have lots of money.

**00:17:19** And they don't do what he's doing.

**00:17:21** So it is a very interesting thing to see.

**00:17:24** It's interesting to see how him and Melinda approach

**00:17:27** the things that they approach and how they tackle them.

**00:17:29** And I can understand that people can criticize

**00:17:32** some of his methods, the decisions that he makes.

**00:17:35** Like there's this one moment where he's talking about

**00:17:37** like we pick the things that we think

**00:17:40** we can have the most impact on.

**00:17:42** So I've got like a couple of quotes here.

**00:17:44** The documentarian was asking him how did they choose

**00:17:47** what he wants, what diseases he wants to try and eradicate.

**00:17:50** And then Bill says like, it's not my goal

**00:17:52** to be inspiring to people.

**00:17:54** The world has limited resources.

**00:17:57** I have resources and I wanna focus on the things

**00:18:00** that I can get the most optimization out of

**00:18:02** and the best results.

**00:18:03** Which like is a very nerdy way to think about philanthropy.

**00:18:09** But it makes sense when you think about it, right?

**00:18:11** Where it's like there could be in theory on paper

**00:18:15** better things for him to focus on.

**00:18:18** But he puts his money where he believes

**00:18:21** he can make the most difference.

**00:18:23** And it continues to be more relevant right now

**00:18:25** because he is investing a lot of money into coronavirus.

**00:18:30** So it's kind of funny like a few weeks ago,

**00:18:33** he sat down with MKBHD and he did an interview.

**00:18:35** This happens every year now when the Bill and Melinda

**00:18:38** Gates Foundation have a letter, like an open letter.

**00:18:40** And now it seems like part of the promotional piece

**00:18:45** is he has an interview with MKBHD.

**00:18:47** This has now happened twice.

**00:18:49** Two times is a pattern, right?

**00:18:50** And in that video he references that,

**00:18:54** oh, like I got an email talking about coronavirus

**00:18:57** and looking at that now.

**00:18:58** And on MKBHD's podcast he was saying that like

**00:19:01** there was like maybe a week's difference

**00:19:03** between when they recorded and when they published it.

**00:19:08** And by the time that they published the video,

**00:19:10** the Gates Foundation had already announced

**00:19:12** like all this money and time and resources

**00:19:14** that they're putting into coronavirus.

**00:19:15** And they were remarking like how fast he went

**00:19:19** from just finding out about it to investing lots of money

**00:19:22** into trying to help it.

**00:19:23** I have a number of thoughts about the documentarian

**00:19:26** and I do have like real annoyances with the series

**00:19:30** but you honed in on two moments that I really love

**00:19:34** and this moment about inspiration is really great

**00:19:38** because to me it's a summary of,

**00:19:44** there is this very difficult thing in charity

**00:19:47** where people sort of respond to how emotive people are

**00:19:54** when describing the things that they're trying to fix.

**00:19:57** Like people respond to like outward expressions

**00:20:00** of sadness and suffering and that is not Gates

**00:20:06** and that's also very often not the way to fix problems.

**00:20:11** Like you have to be able to coldly separate yourself

**00:20:17** from the individuals in order to be the one

**00:20:21** who is actually able to solve problems on a large scale.

**00:20:25** And I just always find it interesting how in conversations

**00:20:30** with people this sort of way of thinking

**00:20:33** many people really respond negatively to of,

**00:20:37** oh, I'm trying to solve this problem with polio

**00:20:40** or I'm trying to solve this problem with poverty.

**00:20:43** And in order to make any progress on that,

**00:20:46** I have to not get swept up in any of the individual cases

**00:20:51** and people are often like, oh, what a monster.

**00:20:53** Like you don't care about those things.

**00:20:54** It's like, no, this is how you do stuff.

**00:20:57** And the exact quote is that the interviewer,

**00:21:00** he's giving this description and there's two things

**00:21:03** and Gates is like, well, these stories of suffering

**00:21:07** for individuals, that is the emotional connection,

**00:21:12** which is the retail of charity business.

**00:21:15** But if you wanna fix the problem,

**00:21:17** you have to think wholesale.

**00:21:19** You have to think in this totally different way.

**00:21:22** And it's like, that sort of sounds like an awful statement

**00:21:25** and the interviewer says like, that's not inspiring, Bill.

**00:21:28** And one of the greatest moments is like,

**00:21:30** before he almost gets to the end of the L sound in Bill,

**00:21:34** Gates just goes, well, that's too bad.

**00:21:38** And he says like, if you're not trying to inspire people,

**00:21:40** what are you doing?

**00:21:41** And Gates says, optimization, right?

**00:21:44** And it's like, that is just, it's great.

**00:21:48** Like, yes, this is how if you wanna solve these problems,

**00:21:51** you have to actually go about it.

**00:21:54** And he's thinking of it like what you're saying

**00:21:57** about the coronavirus,

**00:21:58** which I wasn't fully aware of all those details.

**00:22:02** Part of it is trying to pick projects in a marginal way

**00:22:06** of like, where do his dollars make an additional marginal

**00:22:11** increase in quality or decrease in suffering

**00:22:14** compared to like the charity world in general

**00:22:16** or how difficult the problem is.

**00:22:19** I personally find that like not inspiring,

**00:22:21** but it fills me with hope of like, great,

**00:22:24** this is someone who is not getting distracted

**00:22:27** by the details and is focusing on like the hard things

**00:22:30** to focus about to actually try to fix these problems.

**00:22:33** Even if saying like, oh, we're in the wholesale business

**00:22:37** sounds so grim and so boring, but that's the way you do it.

**00:22:40** But I think this is evidence of an individual

**00:22:43** who is aware of what they're capable of.

**00:22:46** Bill Gates is not an inspiring figure.

**00:22:49** Steve Jobs was an inspiring figure.

**00:22:51** You know, like he would get on the stage and he would talk

**00:22:54** and you would believe whatever he had to say, right?

**00:22:57** And Bill Gates doesn't carry that kind of weight.

**00:23:01** Even Balmer was more inspiring in his own way, right?

**00:23:04** In his own Balmery way.

**00:23:06** But he could, you know, he could amp you up

**00:23:08** and that's just not Gates' way.

**00:23:11** So he is aware of the fact that what he can do

**00:23:15** is give money and knowledge.

**00:23:18** That's what he can do.

**00:23:20** So that's what he does.

**00:23:22** And so like he chooses things,

**00:23:24** I think, where his skills and his resources are best placed.

**00:23:29** And standing on stages and doing these things aren't,

**00:23:33** that's not really his thing.

**00:23:34** And there are many examples of him doing shocking things

**00:23:38** on stages that's different to inspiring.

**00:23:41** He doesn't inspire people.

**00:23:43** He quite frequently scares people, right?

**00:23:45** So there's like, everyone's familiar with the TED Talk

**00:23:48** he gave where he let his skills out into the room

**00:23:51** and locked the doors, right?

**00:23:52** Because it was about malaria.

**00:23:54** And then they show it in this one where he puts a jar

**00:23:58** of human feces on the stage next to him

**00:24:00** when he's talking about sanitation.

**00:24:02** The mosquitoes thing is great because it makes him seem

**00:24:04** like some kind of crazy evil person.

**00:24:07** Which I think he leans into that a little bit, right?

**00:24:10** And it's quite clever where he's like,

**00:24:12** I'm gonna do something terrible to you to prove a point.

**00:24:15** But that's attention getting, but not inspiring

**00:24:19** in the way that inspiring people have like the jobs

**00:24:23** of reality distortion field.

**00:24:25** And it's like, that is a good tool for some things,

**00:24:30** but for very many of the kinds of problems

**00:24:32** that Gates is trying to attack.

**00:24:34** Like that's not helpful.

**00:24:35** If anything, it could be anti-helpful.

**00:24:37** So yeah, like I think my personal thoughts on him

**00:24:40** have changed so much.

**00:24:42** And that particular moment in the film of him going,

**00:24:46** well, that's too bad.

**00:24:47** It was like, oh, Bill Gates,

**00:24:49** you're like my spirit animal in this moment

**00:24:51** of shooting down this dumb question about like,

**00:24:54** it's not inspiring.

**00:24:55** Like, yeah, I'm not interested in that.

**00:24:57** Like I'm interested in fixing the problem.

**00:24:59** Like I'm not gonna lie, there are a lot of things

**00:25:01** in this documentary that made me think of you,

**00:25:03** which was why I wanted to talk about it anyway.

**00:25:06** I wanna talk about these book bag and think weeks.

**00:25:10** Yeah, Bill Gates needs a Kindle.

**00:25:11** I can understand why he doesn't have one, but boy,

**00:25:15** I guess if I had someone to carry around my bag of books

**00:25:18** all day, then maybe I would be less resistant.

**00:25:20** But I got the impression he's carrying it a lot though.

**00:25:23** Yeah, do you think so?

**00:25:24** I don't know.

**00:25:25** I guess it depends on the context.

**00:25:27** So like when he's taking that little plane

**00:25:29** and he's going out to his little shack,

**00:25:31** he's carrying the bag, but yeah, probably a lot other times

**00:25:34** someone's got it for him.

**00:25:36** But it's this tote bag, which is again,

**00:25:38** just very interesting.

**00:25:39** It's everything about this is interesting to me.

**00:25:41** It's like a white and blue tote bag,

**00:25:43** which is just full of books and papers, right?

**00:25:47** Like intellectual papers.

**00:25:49** And they show him like having it packed

**00:25:52** and stuff like that.

**00:25:53** And I know it as well.

**00:25:55** It's like, I don't understand why he's reading actual books.

**00:25:57** I can only imagine he just really needs the paper.

**00:26:00** You know, like I know that some people,

**00:26:02** they prefer it, right?

**00:26:03** Like it helps it sink in.

**00:26:04** And it seems like he is such a voracious reader

**00:26:08** that maybe it just fits with him.

**00:26:10** Like maybe he just can't do it digitally.

**00:26:13** And maybe he doesn't want to slow down.

**00:26:15** Yeah, I can honestly imagine.

**00:26:16** So in the documentary,

**00:26:18** they make a big deal about Bill Gates reading.

**00:26:21** Everyone around him just talks about how,

**00:26:23** like how much he's able to read,

**00:26:25** how quickly he's able to read,

**00:26:27** and his retention level being very high.

**00:26:30** And I can imagine that at this scale,

**00:26:34** so he has like an acquaintance who says,

**00:26:36** oh, he went on vacation with Gates for a week.

**00:26:39** And he read 20 books.

**00:26:41** He read 14 books on vacation.

**00:26:43** He reads at 150 pages an hour.

**00:26:45** Right, yeah.

**00:26:47** And I can imagine that at that scale,

**00:26:51** having the physical books helps your brain distinguish

**00:26:55** and like makes memories better

**00:26:58** of what you're actually reading.

**00:27:00** Whereas if you're doing whatever it is,

**00:27:02** 150 pages an hour on a Kindle screen,

**00:27:05** like maybe it's just too much the same.

**00:27:08** Like just blends in together.

**00:27:09** And he maybe he can't,

**00:27:10** because Melinda at one point references

**00:27:12** that she feels like his brain

**00:27:14** is like a series of compartments.

**00:27:16** Yeah.

**00:27:17** And so like maybe he is like compartmentalizing

**00:27:19** the knowledge a little bit with the book, right?

**00:27:22** And that he needs,

**00:27:23** like maybe that's like kind of the way that his brain works.

**00:27:26** So he needs to be able to recall the book

**00:27:27** to record the knowledge.

**00:27:29** This is also where some of my frustration

**00:27:32** with the documentary comes out.

**00:27:34** Okay.

**00:27:35** Because, so it's called Inside Bill Gates Brain.

**00:27:37** And a lot of this is like the biography of Bill Gates,

**00:27:40** which is totally fine, right?

**00:27:41** Give people the background of this person, you know.

**00:27:43** But the thing about reading, right?

**00:27:45** Is so clearly core to what he does

**00:27:52** and part of his ability to interact

**00:27:54** with such a wide range of people on different topics

**00:27:57** and quickly assess situations and everything else.

**00:28:01** That I don't really want to hear so many other people

**00:28:07** telling me about Gates reading a lot.

**00:28:09** I want to know much more, what does he think about this?

**00:28:13** Like our very speculation of,

**00:28:16** oh, maybe he wants the physical books

**00:28:18** because it's easier to remember.

**00:28:19** Like, I don't know.

**00:28:20** It's just a thought.

**00:28:22** But there's a lot of this where like, I'm not...

**00:28:29** I always have this thing about,

**00:28:31** you shouldn't expect that exceptional people

**00:28:35** are normal people, right?

**00:28:38** The people at the top of any field

**00:28:40** are a bunch of weirdos for a variety of reasons.

**00:28:43** And that's why they're able to be like exceptional people

**00:28:46** in different areas.

**00:28:47** Bill Gates is not normal.

**00:28:47** We have to accept this.

**00:28:49** He is better than us in things.

**00:28:51** Yeah, he's totally not a normal person.

**00:28:54** It wasn't luck.

**00:28:55** It's actually interesting

**00:28:56** because I know my father and mother

**00:28:59** had watched this documentary

**00:29:00** and they'd mentioned it to me ahead of time.

**00:29:02** And my dad had said something like,

**00:29:05** oh, I always thought Bill Gates

**00:29:06** was just like a rich kid who got lucky,

**00:29:09** like right place, right time.

**00:29:10** And he said, oh, I watched this documentary

**00:29:12** and boy did I realize he was not just lucky.

**00:29:17** Like this guy was gonna do something

**00:29:20** and it just happened to be Microsoft, right?

**00:29:22** But he would have done something else

**00:29:24** if that didn't come along.

**00:29:26** But so because of that,

**00:29:28** because like let's just accept

**00:29:30** that this exceptional person

**00:29:32** is different from other people,

**00:29:35** I find it very tiresome to have people in his life

**00:29:40** describing what he's like.

**00:29:43** Like I'm just not interested in their assessments.

**00:29:46** It's like, I wanna know

**00:29:48** what does he think about reading?

**00:29:51** Like how is this for you?

**00:29:54** Or how do you go about picking

**00:29:57** which books you're going to read?

**00:29:58** Like, is that something that you do?

**00:30:01** At this volume of reading,

**00:30:02** like are you selecting or other people selecting?

**00:30:05** Or he talks about,

**00:30:08** I'm sure the thing that you wanna mention,

**00:30:09** but he talks about like his think weeks.

**00:30:11** And he mentions, oh, this is the time

**00:30:13** where he's just dedicated to just reading and thinking

**00:30:17** and how you wanna have some ideas

**00:30:20** in the back of your head that you're working through.

**00:30:22** And it's like, yes, but what do you mean

**00:30:24** by what you're working through?

**00:30:26** Like how is it that you're trying

**00:30:28** to approach these questions

**00:30:29** or how do you select these questions?

**00:30:31** So my frustration is I feel like there was a lot

**00:30:34** of this kind of stuff where other people's descriptions

**00:30:38** of what Bill Gates is up to

**00:30:40** is not remotely what I'm interested in.

**00:30:41** Like I wanna hear Bill Gates talk about stuff.

**00:30:44** And it's particularly interesting that very frequently

**00:30:48** when they're playing the actual interviews with Bill Gates,

**00:30:51** he has so many of these little comments

**00:30:53** like the thing of like, well, that's too bad.

**00:30:56** I'm like, I'm doing optimization.

**00:30:57** That feel like, oh, he's shining through this documentary.

**00:31:01** But I just felt like a lot of this stuff

**00:31:03** wasn't really pursued.

**00:31:05** Like what do you mean by that?

**00:31:06** Like elaborate on that.

**00:31:07** So those are partly some of my frustrations.

**00:31:11** I wanted more, like I want more from Gates.

**00:31:13** So did I, but I kinda wonder if maybe

**00:31:16** that stuff is an interest in to everybody else.

**00:31:20** I can get that, but then maybe don't call your documentary

**00:31:23** like inside Bill's brain.

**00:31:24** But it's a good name though.

**00:31:25** It's a great name, but I think that is not

**00:31:30** what they are selling in this documentary.

**00:31:32** I was expecting it to be a little more autobiographical

**00:31:36** than it actually is.

**00:31:38** Cause ultimately the reason that he did this documentary

**00:31:40** is to promote the foundation.

**00:31:42** Yeah, I think so.

**00:31:43** It is a marketing piece for the foundation,

**00:31:45** which from his perspective, I'm on board with that.

**00:31:48** There is no problem with that.

**00:31:50** But I still maybe would have liked to have seen

**00:31:51** a fourth episode that did more, right?

**00:31:54** Why does he read what he reads?

**00:31:56** How much time does he read?

**00:31:57** Where does he read?

**00:31:58** Right, does he read in that library?

**00:32:00** Is the library just for storing books?

**00:32:02** Why does he keep the books?

**00:32:03** Why does he read on paper?

**00:32:05** Like all of this stuff, which I would love to know more about.

**00:32:09** But there was something I wanted to touch on,

**00:32:10** which is kind of, it's in my notes for this area

**00:32:13** is they talked to Mike Slade,

**00:32:15** who's the former director at Microsoft.

**00:32:18** And he says that Bill always knows more

**00:32:21** than the other person he's talking to.

**00:32:23** And this comes across so frequently in the documentary,

**00:32:27** or at least if you don't see that,

**00:32:29** you see him knowing things that like,

**00:32:33** it's surprising that he knows.

**00:32:35** So like he walked, when he's,

**00:32:37** there's a couple of instances,

**00:32:38** both with sanitation and with nuclear power.

**00:32:41** These are two of the things that the foundation's focused on.

**00:32:44** And one of the ways that Bill tries to push innovation

**00:32:48** is to basically create a competition.

**00:32:53** So he'll have universities and companies compete

**00:32:56** to create a solution to a problem,

**00:32:58** which he will then fund, right?

**00:33:01** In both of these instances, he's going into like,

**00:33:03** and this is especially in the one where they're doing

**00:33:05** nuclear power, he's going into these rooms

**00:33:08** and he's talking to people,

**00:33:09** and he is having incredibly in-depth technical conversations

**00:33:14** and asking all these questions

**00:33:16** that I can't even fathom to understand.

**00:33:19** And sometimes you see kind of like surprises

**00:33:22** with the people he's talking to.

**00:33:23** And it's like, this is stuff you shouldn't know.

**00:33:26** You didn't do this.

**00:33:27** Like you were not a nuclear physicist, right?

**00:33:30** You did not do this, Bill.

**00:33:32** Like this was not your thing,

**00:33:35** but he's learned it all by reading.

**00:33:38** And it is unbelievable.

**00:33:40** There's a little section I really like,

**00:33:41** which is, I don't have the name off hand,

**00:33:44** but they interview the guy who has written

**00:33:47** all of the books on energy.

**00:33:48** He's like the German or Austrian guy.

**00:33:51** Oh yeah, I don't remember the guy's name either,

**00:33:53** but like there's the thing where he's like,

**00:33:55** this book has an audience of one and it's just me.

**00:33:58** Like I don't know.

**00:33:59** It's even more brutal.

**00:34:00** Like, but this is where like Gates,

**00:34:03** his interesting way of thinking shines through

**00:34:05** because it's another line I really like of his,

**00:34:07** where he says, he doesn't say it has an audience of one.

**00:34:10** He says, the natural audience of this book

**00:34:14** may be less than one, right?

**00:34:17** Which is like kind of an amazing and brutal review,

**00:34:21** but also pitches it in a way of like,

**00:34:25** that's just what this book is, right?

**00:34:27** He's not saying like, oh, it's a bad book or like,

**00:34:29** there's none of that.

**00:34:31** He's just like, oh, Vladislav went too far on this one

**00:34:34** and you know, just went too far and went completely into it.

**00:34:37** And I love when they talk to this guy

**00:34:40** who his whole professional life is thinking

**00:34:44** and writing about energy

**00:34:46** and the human civilizations use of energy.

**00:34:50** And he's written, you know, whatever it is, 20 books.

**00:34:52** He has a huge number of books.

**00:34:54** And they ask him, you know,

**00:34:55** has anybody read all of your books?

**00:34:57** And it's like, maybe just Gates, you know,

**00:34:59** that's like the only person who's even come close

**00:35:02** to doing this.

**00:35:03** But what comes across for me,

**00:35:05** even though the documentary doesn't specifically say it

**00:35:07** is his ability to read has allowed him

**00:35:11** to essentially absorb the entire professional career

**00:35:15** of another expert.

**00:35:17** He knows nearly as much about energy

**00:35:19** as like the world's expert knows about energy

**00:35:22** because he's just consumed everything that he's read.

**00:35:25** And that is the thing that allows him to move

**00:35:30** between different environments and talk to people

**00:35:32** because I don't think he's just done it with that one guy.

**00:35:35** They're just using that guy as an example of like, yeah,

**00:35:39** Gates can do this, like read your book,

**00:35:42** absorb your stuff, keep it in his head for future reference

**00:35:45** and be able to pull it out in a conversation

**00:35:47** when it's necessary.

**00:35:49** And it's an incredible skill.

**00:35:50** It's an incredible skill.

**00:35:52** I liked, I know you, maybe we'll get into it a little more

**00:35:55** about like you said, you didn't like the documentarian.

**00:35:58** Is that a word by the way?

**00:36:00** Am I using, have I made up a word or is that?

**00:36:02** No, no, that's correct.

**00:36:03** That's a word.

**00:36:04** But there was a few things that I enjoyed,

**00:36:05** especially towards the beginning of the episode

**00:36:08** was like the way he would ask Bill questions.

**00:36:09** I think that he worked out that Bill will answer things

**00:36:13** immediately and he knows things that people shouldn't know.

**00:36:17** So like there's one scene which I loved about this

**00:36:20** when they're playing tennis.

**00:36:22** There's playing tennis and he'll ask him,

**00:36:24** what's the longest you've played tennis?

**00:36:25** And Bill immediately says eight hours.

**00:36:27** He goes, what's the highest temperature?

**00:36:28** It's like 106 degrees.

**00:36:30** He has worked out, I think that Bill remembers things

**00:36:34** that people don't typically remember.

**00:36:36** And he'll ask him questions like that.

**00:36:38** And it's fascinating to see this complete deadpan responses.

**00:36:43** He is effectively returning the answer

**00:36:46** that you've asked the computer.

**00:36:48** Like it's just immediately like available

**00:36:50** to you this information.

**00:36:51** And I actually did really like that.

**00:36:53** And even questions like, you know,

**00:36:54** soon what's your worst fear?

**00:36:56** And Bill says, I don't want my brain to stop working.

**00:36:58** And I immediately thought of you.

**00:37:00** Cause that feels to me like something you would say.

**00:37:02** Well, if you listened to Gates talk, he does the,

**00:37:06** like I picked up on it as well.

**00:37:08** He many times references his brain

**00:37:12** as a separate entity in that way.

**00:37:14** Like he doesn't phrase it as,

**00:37:17** I don't want to get dementia.

**00:37:18** It's like, I don't want my brain to stop working.

**00:37:21** And there's a few other times in the film

**00:37:24** where I noticed that.

**00:37:25** I mean, I'm always a big believer

**00:37:26** and I think that's a useful way to self conceptualize.

**00:37:30** I think that that helps you think more clearly

**00:37:33** about yourself in relation to other things.

**00:37:36** And yeah, like of course that's going to be his big fear.

**00:37:40** Like how much of his life is defined by his brain.

**00:37:46** It makes me think of John von Neumann,

**00:37:48** who's sort of considered to probably be one

**00:37:51** of the smartest people who's ever lived.

**00:37:53** Like that was his horror at the end of his life

**00:37:55** is he could feel like he was losing grip

**00:37:59** in his final days on the like the sharpness of his mind.

**00:38:03** And I imagine for someone whose life

**00:38:06** is just so intellectual, no one wants to get dementia,

**00:38:10** but it has to be more horrible if you know

**00:38:15** you are a much sharper knife

**00:38:17** than the average knife in the drawer.

**00:38:19** In the same way that I imagine if you are a great athlete,

**00:38:22** losing your physicality must be harder than it is

**00:38:26** for someone who like never experienced the peak

**00:38:29** of what their body can do.

**00:38:30** Hey, here's something I just found.

**00:38:32** I just figured to Google it.

**00:38:33** It's true.

**00:38:34** Gates has made heavy investments into Alzheimer's.

**00:38:39** Okay, interesting.

**00:38:40** Cause that was what I thought was like,

**00:38:44** it just dawned on me.

**00:38:45** Like if surely he's doing that,

**00:38:47** surely he's putting money into that

**00:38:49** because it's something he is concerned of for himself.

**00:38:53** Yeah.

**00:38:54** Right?

**00:38:55** Like as in like if he doesn't want his brain

**00:38:56** to stop working, surely he would be funding research

**00:38:59** into making sure that that wouldn't happen.

**00:39:02** Right?

**00:39:03** That like that maybe by the time

**00:39:04** that these things would happen to him,

**00:39:06** there may be cures that he's helped fund.

**00:39:09** I have no problem with that.

**00:39:10** Right?

**00:39:11** Like it was just like a thing that I thought was like,

**00:39:12** surely he's put money into that.

**00:39:14** And it turns out he has millions, tens of millions.

**00:39:17** That's not surprising, but it also is like,

**00:39:19** it's not a bad place to put money again,

**00:39:21** if you're trying to assess human suffering.

**00:39:24** Oh, cause it's a horrific thing

**00:39:25** that human beings have to go through.

**00:39:27** It's horrific.

**00:39:28** And it's also, you know,

**00:39:29** if you just do the quick calculation of,

**00:39:31** well, if healthcare keeps improving,

**00:39:34** the number and duration of the population

**00:39:36** that has to spend time with Alzheimer's will only go up.

**00:39:41** Right?

**00:39:42** Like this is not a problem that goes down

**00:39:43** as healthcare improves.

**00:39:44** This is a problem that goes up.

**00:39:45** And as far as I'm aware from like,

**00:39:47** I looked into this a while ago,

**00:39:49** or it came across my path a while ago.

**00:39:50** It's actually not a very well-researched thing.

**00:39:54** Like in the history of medicine,

**00:39:56** like there hasn't been a lot about some of his research.

**00:39:59** Like there was not a lot of funding for it.

**00:40:01** So like it's not surprising to me that he would,

**00:40:04** cause you say you could maybe make a significant change

**00:40:08** without a lot of money.

**00:40:11** Yeah.

**00:40:11** You know, like if it's not been funded or researched

**00:40:13** very well, like you might be able to make

**00:40:15** some surprising jumps on that.

**00:40:17** You're thinking about the questions.

**00:40:19** Like I don't love the interviewer's method of questions.

**00:40:22** And I do think like right at the beginning,

**00:40:25** so he asked Bill Gates a couple of questions.

**00:40:27** He's like, what's your favorite this?

**00:40:28** What's your favorite that?

**00:40:30** And I'm pretty convinced that's the first time

**00:40:33** the interviewer sat down with Gates.

**00:40:35** Yeah, probably.

**00:40:36** Cause there's just like a couple of interviews

**00:40:37** and that feels like they're always cutting back to that one.

**00:40:41** Cause it's the higher level, like,

**00:40:43** hey, getting to know each other kind of interview.

**00:40:45** I'm convinced like I did go back and watch it,

**00:40:48** that those first two questions where he asks something like,

**00:40:50** what's your favorite color?

**00:40:52** And then he goes, what's your favorite animal?

**00:40:55** And like I'm looking into Gates' eyes there.

**00:40:57** And I think he in this moment is debating

**00:40:59** for a couple of seconds about whether or not

**00:41:02** to just abort this whole project.

**00:41:03** But that's what I like about those questions.

**00:41:05** Like, and I don't think that the guy

**00:41:07** is doing it accidentally.

**00:41:09** Now the interviewer saves it.

**00:41:10** So he says, what's your favorite color?

**00:41:12** What's your favorite animal?

**00:41:13** And Bill Gates kind of answers both of them dismissively.

**00:41:16** And then he says, what's your favorite animal that you eat?

**00:41:19** And then you can see Gates was like, oh, okay, okay.

**00:41:22** That reminded me of Blade Runner.

**00:41:24** I can see that.

**00:41:25** A list of questions that got weird in a way

**00:41:29** that you wouldn't ask someone.

**00:41:31** Whereas like, what's your favorite food?

**00:41:33** What's your favorite animal?

**00:41:34** What's your favorite animal to eat?

**00:41:36** Like that sequence of questioning is very strange.

**00:41:40** And I think purposeful as like a way to maybe try

**00:41:44** and unseat him a little bit, like kind of lure him in

**00:41:48** and then just like throw him off.

**00:41:49** Cause that is, if somebody asked me that question,

**00:41:51** I'd be like, what are you talking about?

**00:41:53** No one's ever asked me that.

**00:41:54** Like what was so weird?

**00:41:56** So I actually kind of liked it.

**00:41:57** I thought the progression was interesting

**00:42:00** because you can see on Bill's face,

**00:42:02** where he's like, who is this moron?

**00:42:04** Yeah, but that's why I'm convinced

**00:42:06** in those first two seconds, he's already booting up

**00:42:09** the like, do I abort this whole project part of his brain?

**00:42:12** And I think when he talks about some

**00:42:14** of the monopoly stuff later,

**00:42:16** I love the way he answers the question,

**00:42:17** but it's the same thing where he's like,

**00:42:19** they talk about him being arrogant.

**00:42:20** And he's like, yeah, when you have to make decisions

**00:42:23** for thousands of people and you don't have minutes to spare,

**00:42:26** like, yeah, you can seem quite arrogant.

**00:42:28** And I just sort of like see this little bit

**00:42:30** of maybe younger Bill Gates being like,

**00:42:33** oh God, what is this gonna be?

**00:42:35** His seeps out a little bit there.

**00:42:36** And that part is quite cleverly done

**00:42:39** because they're overlapping that conversation

**00:42:41** with some of the deposition videos

**00:42:44** of when Gates was on trial with the Department of Justice

**00:42:48** over monopoly stuff, right?

**00:42:49** For Netscape and Internet Explorer.

**00:42:52** This was back in the 90s, I think.

**00:42:54** And like you say, right?

**00:42:55** He was like, oh, do you think you are arrogant?

**00:42:57** And he's like, well, if you're in your 20s

**00:42:59** and you've got billions of dollars,

**00:43:01** you're responsible for thousands of people

**00:43:03** and you grow in a company

**00:43:04** and every five minutes means something,

**00:43:06** you probably would come across a little arrogant.

**00:43:08** When I hear that, I'm like, okay.

**00:43:11** Like I agree with it.

**00:43:12** What do you mean?

**00:43:14** What do you mean?

**00:43:15** I agree with what he's saying,

**00:43:17** but you can feel that,

**00:43:20** and Melinda touches on it as well,

**00:43:22** that the antitrust lawsuits really affected him

**00:43:27** in a big way.

**00:43:28** And he clearly doesn't want to talk about it.

**00:43:31** Right, like ultimately,

**00:43:31** I think he just doesn't want to confront that again.

**00:43:35** You know, basically the interview asks him,

**00:43:37** he's like, did you have a monopoly?

**00:43:40** And then Gates, he kind of tries to make the argument

**00:43:43** that they could have been toppled by another company, right?

**00:43:46** So he feels it isn't monopolistic in that sense,

**00:43:49** but then immediately says, I know that sounds weasily,

**00:43:51** like I'm trying to get out of this

**00:43:52** by like explaining it away.

**00:43:54** Yeah, but say like, again, I'm kind of with Gates here.

**00:43:58** I am not saying that I disagree with the way it all shook out.

**00:44:04** Like I am a person of the internet.

**00:44:06** I have watched come and go many companies, right?

**00:44:10** Who like seemed dominant and then are just knocked off.

**00:44:13** I think we're at a point where maybe some companies

**00:44:15** will never be knocked off now.

**00:44:17** Like we've got to a different point in internet's history.

**00:44:20** Yeah, that may be true.

**00:44:21** But it was for a time, like, yeah, I mean,

**00:44:23** internet explorer had 98% market share,

**00:44:25** but that wasn't gonna last

**00:44:27** because Microsoft didn't last that way.

**00:44:30** My point is just like, if you are having to say,

**00:44:33** I am aware that sounds weasily,

**00:44:35** you know that you're not making an argument

**00:44:37** which is definitive.

**00:44:39** I'm like, I don't know.

**00:44:40** I'm not sure I agree with that,

**00:44:41** but I think there's, I just think there's also something

**00:44:43** interesting here, which is I never even realized.

**00:44:46** I didn't realize that the higher court overturned

**00:44:50** the verdict against Microsoft.

**00:44:52** Oh, really?

**00:44:52** I was totally shocked by this piece of information

**00:44:55** because I had always thought like, oh yeah,

**00:44:57** they got hit with this antitrust lawsuit and they lost.

**00:45:01** The whole like retrial completely bypassed me

**00:45:04** and in the dustbin of history, like it just didn't,

**00:45:06** you know what I think?

**00:45:07** Didn't cross my mind.

**00:45:08** I think you may be confusing it with the European Union.

**00:45:11** Maybe that's what it is.

**00:45:12** The European Union did find Microsoft.

**00:45:16** Right, right.

**00:45:17** Okay, yeah, maybe.

**00:45:18** It was over the very same thing.

**00:45:20** Right, okay, yeah, maybe that's why it's kind of muddled up

**00:45:24** in my head.

**00:45:24** Yeah, and I believe off the top of my head,

**00:45:28** I'll put some links in the show notes

**00:45:29** if people want to confirm this for themselves,

**00:45:31** but off the top of my head, like that was not overturned

**00:45:34** and they paid like half a billion dollars

**00:45:35** or something like that.

**00:45:36** Yeah, yeah, yeah, that sounds right to the European Union.

**00:45:39** Yeah, so it may have just been like,

**00:45:43** if you do want paying attention,

**00:45:45** you would just assume that like there were guilty everywhere.

**00:45:47** So the thing about him with the monopoly

**00:45:49** is there's two really interesting,

**00:45:51** my second most like interesting moment in the documentary

**00:45:54** is in this little part two.

**00:45:56** But yeah, so the interview asks him like,

**00:45:57** did you have a monopoly?

**00:45:59** And his exact quote is,

**00:46:00** if by monopoly you mean a high market share, then yes.

**00:46:04** But if you mean an unchallengeable market position,

**00:46:07** then no.

**00:46:07** And that's where he's like, you know,

**00:46:09** if that sounds like I'm being weaselly, you know?

**00:46:12** And, but I just think there's a part here

**00:46:16** where like stuff like this is just not simple.

**00:46:20** Like that question is just not a simple question.

**00:46:23** And like I'm with Gates on this of like,

**00:46:27** he's in this horrible position that if people ask him,

**00:46:30** did you have a monopoly?

**00:46:31** What people sort of mean is,

**00:46:34** did you have really high market share?

**00:46:36** All right, but that's, you know,

**00:46:37** that isn't what a monopoly is.

**00:46:40** But-

**00:46:41** But so my question on that though is,

**00:46:43** did Bill Gates in 1997 or whatever

**00:46:47** really believe that he could be challenged?

**00:46:50** Yeah, I mean, that's a totally different question,

**00:46:53** which I don't know the answer to.

**00:46:55** Because I think that does change it though, right?

**00:46:57** Like if he believed at that time

**00:47:00** that no one could beat Microsoft and Internet Explorer,

**00:47:06** that perception changes the outcome, right?

**00:47:10** And I know that's like, how could you can't,

**00:47:12** there's no facts in that, right?

**00:47:14** So like, it's difficult to put that on trial.

**00:47:18** But like, I'm just making the point of like,

**00:47:19** I think that does make it slightly different.

**00:47:22** Because I would believe that he probably thought

**00:47:24** no one could beat him then.

**00:47:27** Like you just, you see the kind of guy he was then,

**00:47:30** especially, and I genuinely believe that he was in the idea

**00:47:34** of like, we've won this.

**00:47:37** Yeah, that's very possible.

**00:47:39** Like that's very possible.

**00:47:40** And if that's the case, it's like, well then what was it?

**00:47:42** Right, so like now we can argue on technicalities,

**00:47:44** but if the guy running the company thinks that he's won,

**00:47:46** then they, anyway, it's too complicated.

**00:47:48** It's incredibly complicated.

**00:47:50** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**00:47:51** I think it's an interesting thing to think about at least.

**00:47:53** Yeah, it is interesting.

**00:47:55** And it goes back to like, it's just,

**00:47:58** you can so see in the clips that like,

**00:48:02** young Bill Gates is this really abrasive guy.

**00:48:06** So good in those clips.

**00:48:08** Yeah, and like old Bill Gates is like a friendly grandpa

**00:48:12** and it's such a, but you can see,

**00:48:15** you can still see the same person.

**00:48:17** Well, see, that's interesting though, right?

**00:48:18** Cause like, so they show those,

**00:48:19** so show the clips of him being deposed and he is,

**00:48:23** and I understand it, like he is being asked

**00:48:25** the most idiotic questions, right?

**00:48:27** By people that do not understand,

**00:48:29** we've all seen the clips of like Zuckerberg in,

**00:48:32** caught in America and they're asking him like,

**00:48:35** how do I change the ringtone on my iPhone

**00:48:38** crap like that, right?

**00:48:39** And like, that's clearly what's happening.

**00:48:40** Yeah, and it's like, I've got no sympathy.

**00:48:43** You know, Zuckerberg, I would say is not a person

**00:48:47** I have any warmness in my heart for,

**00:48:49** but even still it's like, oh God, can you imagine

**00:48:54** being as smart as Zuckerberg and having to on camera,

**00:48:58** like listen for hours to these totally idiotic questions

**00:49:04** for people that know nothing.

**00:49:05** He's there to talk about something completely different.

**00:49:08** And like, these people are bringing

**00:49:09** their tech support questions to him.

**00:49:11** It's like, I'm sure it was exactly the same kind

**00:49:13** of conversation in those depositions, right?

**00:49:16** So like, you can see how he gets that way.

**00:49:19** And Gates had to sit there all day, right?

**00:49:22** So you like, I can guarantee you those clips are from

**00:49:25** hour seven of day two of questions.

**00:49:27** But then there are also the clips of him in office meetings

**00:49:31** at Microsoft where he is just like losing it, right?

**00:49:36** And there's like, someone says that he used to say like,

**00:49:39** that is the most idiotic thing I've heard all day

**00:49:42** when he said it like 10 minutes earlier

**00:49:44** about something else.

**00:49:46** But the thing is like, he's also asked questions of like,

**00:49:51** has he mellowed?

**00:49:53** And people are like, no, he hasn't.

**00:49:56** And I wonder if maybe he can just control himself better now

**00:50:00** but ultimately he's still the same kind of guy.

**00:50:05** Well, so it's only one person who answers the question of,

**00:50:09** so Gates himself says that he's mellowed.

**00:50:12** And it's, I forget, it's just like the venture capital dude

**00:50:16** is the only one who says no, but his answer is like,

**00:50:22** no, if anything, he's amped up what he's trying to do,

**00:50:25** which is like a slightly, yeah.

**00:50:28** Like I think that question was a slightly different

**00:50:31** sort of thing, but I don't doubt that like,

**00:50:35** if Bill Gates wants to, he can turn on.

**00:50:38** He can lose it, yeah.

**00:50:39** Yeah, the like arrogance of a younger man.

**00:50:42** But before we leave the monopoly thing,

**00:50:43** the one thing which is my perhaps most favorite moment

**00:50:46** in the whole documentary is when the interviewer asks him

**00:50:49** something like, oh, what would you tell your younger self

**00:50:52** about that whole time?

**00:50:54** And Gates's whole manner changes.

**00:50:58** He gets colder and he says to his younger self,

**00:51:04** you have an overly simplistic view of what's going on here.

**00:51:07** I loved that so much.

**00:51:10** Well, so the interviewer goes like,

**00:51:12** what do you mean defensive?

**00:51:14** And he says, you're naive, you're naive.

**00:51:17** And this is also partly where like,

**00:51:19** I'm sort of frustrated with the interviewer

**00:51:21** because boy, do I want Bill Gates to expand on that point.

**00:51:24** Even though I think-

**00:51:26** No, he's not gonna though, Gray.

**00:51:28** Like if you asked him,

**00:51:29** he's not gonna say it any more than that.

**00:51:30** Right, but like even just the clip of him saying

**00:51:33** like he's not gonna say any more than that, right?

**00:51:36** But like, I think anybody who's thinking this through

**00:51:42** can pick up what Bill Gates is putting down in this moment.

**00:51:47** Kind of like, hey kid, you think this is actually about

**00:51:52** is Microsoft a monopoly?

**00:51:54** And like you're trying to fight this game

**00:51:57** on is Microsoft a monopoly?

**00:52:00** And this is not remotely the reason

**00:52:03** why you're stuck in this situation.

**00:52:04** Like that's not what's going on here.

**00:52:07** And you can't control them.

**00:52:09** Yeah, and it's the same thing with Zuckerberg of like,

**00:52:14** why was Zuckerberg hauled over to Washington DC?

**00:52:18** Like is it for the reasons they really said

**00:52:21** or is it for other reasons?

**00:52:23** Like, oh, I think we all know it's also for other reasons.

**00:52:27** But that is my favorite moment.

**00:52:28** And part of it is just his demeanor change.

**00:52:32** And like, I'm making a real statement here

**00:52:35** for people who wanna hear what I'm really trying to say.

**00:52:40** Like you have an overly simplistic view

**00:52:43** of what's going on here.

**00:52:45** I thought that was great.

**00:52:46** Let's talk about the think weeks.

**00:52:48** Okay.

**00:52:49** So Bill started these when he was at Microsoft

**00:52:52** in the 90s and he has a little cabin that he goes out to,

**00:52:55** which looks very remote.

**00:52:56** It looks like sea plane only to get that kind of thing.

**00:52:59** And it's referenced in the documentary

**00:53:01** that this is like a time that he'll take

**00:53:03** to distill his thoughts.

**00:53:04** He just reads and he thinks.

**00:53:06** Someone refers to it as like CPU time.

**00:53:08** It's just like when his brain is processing things.

**00:53:11** And I also noted that he loves Diet Coke.

**00:53:12** He drinks a lot of Diet Coke.

**00:53:14** There's like a whole fridge of Diet Coke.

**00:53:16** Yeah, as soon as you tune into it,

**00:53:17** he's actually drinking Diet Coke

**00:53:19** through a huge portion of the documentary.

**00:53:21** It's like constantly drinking Diet Coke.

**00:53:23** It's like, hey man, I think you might have a problem.

**00:53:27** Yeah.

**00:53:27** Well, so we're going to talk about Warren Buffett later on,

**00:53:30** because we have to,

**00:53:31** because that's a lot of interesting things in there.

**00:53:33** But Warren Buffett is also a big Coke guy.

**00:53:36** Yeah, I know.

**00:53:37** Yeah, I saw the same thing.

**00:53:38** It's like, what's going on here?

**00:53:40** I think it's Cherry Coke for Warren Buffett.

**00:53:42** Oh, it was a different one.

**00:53:43** Okay.

**00:53:44** He drinks like five cans of Cherry Coke a day.

**00:53:47** And this came up on an episode of Connected a long time ago,

**00:53:51** because I don't know if you saw this,

**00:53:52** but like Apple made some game called Warren Buffett Paper

**00:53:56** Wizard.

**00:53:57** I know.

**00:53:58** Super weird.

**00:53:59** Like Buffett owns like a massive portion of Apple.

**00:54:01** He owns like 5% of Apple or something.

**00:54:03** Right.

**00:54:04** And at this investor meeting the day like Tim Cook came out

**00:54:07** and they made this game and it was this big fun thing.

**00:54:09** It was on the app store,

**00:54:10** but only for like two weeks and he took it down.

**00:54:12** So weird.

**00:54:14** Like Apple made the game.

**00:54:16** And it's like, you're going around and throwing newspapers

**00:54:20** at like Apple HQ.

**00:54:22** Oh, oh my God.

**00:54:24** Yes. Okay.

**00:54:25** This sounds familiar.

**00:54:26** Yeah.

**00:54:27** Cause Buffett had like a paper route as a kid or something.

**00:54:29** Yeah.

**00:54:30** That's how we started his fortune, right?

**00:54:31** That's like the story.

**00:54:32** His story like paper boy in Omaha worked around,

**00:54:37** worked it up and up and up.

**00:54:38** And now he's like one of the richest men ever,

**00:54:39** that kind of thing.

**00:54:40** But anyway, he, he was at the face of Cherry Coke in China.

**00:54:44** Really?

**00:54:45** Yeah.

**00:54:46** Warren Buffett is like freaking fascinating.

**00:54:49** Like the more you look into that guy,

**00:54:51** the stranger it gets like in many ways, but yeah.

**00:54:56** So there's a connection there with Coke, but,

**00:54:57** but the think weeks like they,

**00:54:59** obviously they jumped out to me because it is very similar

**00:55:02** to the Grecation, right?

**00:55:04** And I just wanted to know what you thought about it.

**00:55:07** The very first thing I wanted to know was,

**00:55:10** is that his real cabin?

**00:55:11** Is that really the place that he goes?

**00:55:14** Like I just, I couldn't, I can't decide if it is.

**00:55:16** I think it is.

**00:55:17** I feel like it is.

**00:55:18** Wouldn't it be?

**00:55:20** I don't know.

**00:55:21** Just like how much does he want to show on camera?

**00:55:24** If someone was doing a documentary on me,

**00:55:26** I can guarantee to you that I would not be showing them

**00:55:28** where I actually go for Grecations, right?

**00:55:31** And so I was just wondering like,

**00:55:32** oh, if Gates goes to the same place all the time,

**00:55:35** does he want people to see the inside?

**00:55:37** I think it is his place, but it just kind of struck me.

**00:55:40** Yes, I wonder.

**00:55:42** I don't think Bill Gates' residence is a very secret.

**00:55:45** Yeah, I know.

**00:55:46** But still, like how much do you want to show or not show?

**00:55:48** So anyway, the way it looked struck me as sort of exactly

**00:55:52** what I would expect of, it's a small place, it's focused.

**00:55:57** It seems to contain nothing but books and a bed

**00:56:00** and a refrigerator full of Thai Coke.

**00:56:04** And that's what you would want if you're doing this,

**00:56:07** is narrow and focused.

**00:56:08** You see, I buy it because if it was more lavish,

**00:56:12** I would have maybe raised an eyebrow.

**00:56:15** But like the realisticness of it just being a bed,

**00:56:18** a table, a fridge, and a bookcase is like,

**00:56:21** I can imagine that being all he would have.

**00:56:24** Yeah, yeah.

**00:56:25** Like I said, it focuses.

**00:56:27** You have less to do, you're just gonna sit here

**00:56:29** and you're just gonna read.

**00:56:30** This is also where I really just wanted to kind of know more,

**00:56:34** but it's interesting why he calls them think weeks,

**00:56:38** I think, is because he says, it's very fast,

**00:56:41** but he says that he goes there

**00:56:43** with a list of particular questions

**00:56:46** that he has in the back of his mind.

**00:56:49** And so he has this example of like,

**00:56:51** oh, when will low interest rates end?

**00:56:56** Like that's a question that he has on his mind.

**00:56:57** The way he kind of phrased it,

**00:56:59** which I also found interesting, was kind of like,

**00:57:02** you know you have, it's like he's kind of like talking,

**00:57:04** you know you have those questions,

**00:57:05** they pop up in your brain

**00:57:07** and they're just things that they occur to you.

**00:57:09** Why go there to actually think about those things?

**00:57:12** Yeah.

**00:57:13** So like, as you say, like,

**00:57:15** what about interest rates,

**00:57:16** why are interest rates so great that they are,

**00:57:18** when are they gonna change?

**00:57:19** Like people think of these things, but let them go.

**00:57:22** Yeah.

**00:57:22** But it seems like he like, is like, no, I wanna know.

**00:57:25** And like he will maybe record them, find resources,

**00:57:28** go there and answer those questions,

**00:57:30** which is obviously a very different type of living

**00:57:33** or thinking than most people.

**00:57:35** Yeah, because I was just connecting it to,

**00:57:37** there's an earlier part in the documentary

**00:57:39** where he says, you have to pick a finite number of things

**00:57:42** for your mind to work on, which again,

**00:57:44** he's like distancing himself from his own brain.

**00:57:47** Like, you're not picking a finite number of things

**00:57:50** for you to think about, it's for your mind to work on.

**00:57:53** And just trying to connect the dots a little bit,

**00:57:56** I get the impression that that's sort of related

**00:58:00** to the think week, that he's,

**00:58:03** it really sounds like he's going there

**00:58:05** with like a piece of paper with 10 questions

**00:58:08** on it or something.

**00:58:09** And he's dedicating this time to actually trying

**00:58:13** to get answers about these particular things.

**00:58:16** Like he is not going in an undirected way,

**00:58:20** he's going in a purposeful way, which,

**00:58:23** like I had heard about the think weeks in some general way

**00:58:28** of like, oh, this is a thing that Bill Gates does,

**00:58:31** but it was interesting to me to see

**00:58:33** that it's not what I had vaguely thought about of,

**00:58:36** oh, it must just be unstructured.

**00:58:38** He's spending a week catching up on the reading

**00:58:41** that he couldn't do during the rest of the year.

**00:58:44** And it's not like what you do, right?

**00:58:46** Which is like focused work time.

**00:58:48** It's not that, like he's just reading with no distractions.

**00:58:54** In many ways, it's the total opposite of work time

**00:58:57** that he's, it sounds like, oh, he's using this

**00:59:01** as a time to separate and possibly adjust course

**00:59:07** based on the answers that he gets to various questions.

**00:59:10** And like, you know, you were saying, like,

**00:59:11** this is something I would want to dig more into.

**00:59:13** Like how often does he do them?

**00:59:15** How accessible is he during these times?

**00:59:18** Like, is he doing literally anything else?

**00:59:21** How does he prepare for them?

**00:59:22** How does everyone around him prepare for him being gone?

**00:59:25** Yeah, yeah, that's all the stuff that, yeah.

**00:59:27** I'd wanna know all those things.

**00:59:28** And I would really just wanna know even just a little bit

**00:59:33** about what are you doing to try to answer these questions?

**00:59:38** Like you must be thinking about this

**00:59:40** in a more structured way than,

**00:59:42** oh, I just grabbed a bunch of books, right?

**00:59:44** Like you're doing something else.

**00:59:46** What are you doing?

**00:59:47** Or how do you think about these questions?

**00:59:49** Or how many questions do you have?

**00:59:51** How do you select them?

**00:59:52** Like, you know, like I think there's just so much more there.

**00:59:56** Do you expect to actually answer them?

**00:59:58** Yeah, yeah.

**00:59:59** But again, these are not things

**01:00:01** that most people are gonna care about.

**01:00:02** Like if you're making this documentary for Netflix,

**01:00:06** really it's like if they're making a documentary for us,

**01:00:09** it's very different.

**01:00:10** I would like to get inside of Bill Gates' brain though.

**01:00:13** Can somebody out there get us to interview Bill

**01:00:17** and we can really dig into this stuff?

**01:00:20** If someone could just pass this along to him,

**01:00:22** it'd be great.

**01:00:22** Yeah, yeah.

**01:00:23** But so again, like there's these moments

**01:00:26** where Gates kind of shines through and I love them.

**01:00:28** And those are the parts that were like,

**01:00:30** knowing about what his organization was up to

**01:00:33** was fascinating.

**01:00:34** Like knowing more of these details was really interesting,

**01:00:36** but Gates shining through is amazing.

**01:00:40** And the other thing that I wanted so bad

**01:00:42** after this documentary, I wanna Netflix series

**01:00:47** that's just called like the Warren and Bill show.

**01:00:50** And I wanna see like Warren Buffett and Bill Gates

**01:00:54** just hanging out and talking about whatever.

**01:00:58** It's the best.

**01:00:59** I love it so much.

**01:01:01** Playing bridge at the local Omaha bridge club,

**01:01:04** just as a couple of normal Joes, it's amazing.

**01:01:07** They're getting hamburgers with more salt

**01:01:10** than any human being should ever consume.

**01:01:12** That is so disgusting.

**01:01:15** But I love that they're joking about it too.

**01:01:17** I was physically appalled by the amount of salt

**01:01:22** that Warren Buffett put on his burger.

**01:01:24** On a plain burger.

**01:01:25** There's nothing else on it.

**01:01:27** Also the detail that really got me

**01:01:30** is he put it on the bottom of the bun,

**01:01:33** like on the bottom of the burger patty.

**01:01:35** So he didn't take off the top and salt the top of the burger.

**01:01:39** He flipped the burger upside down,

**01:01:41** salted the underside of the patty,

**01:01:44** put the bottom of the burger back on, flipped it over,

**01:01:48** and then looked like the happiest man on earth

**01:01:50** as he bit into the burger.

**01:01:51** I love that he said something like,

**01:01:53** it was just great to have made my decisions

**01:01:56** by the time I was 11 about what I like to eat or something.

**01:02:00** Yeah, yeah.

**01:02:02** I can't help but feel like there are things about,

**01:02:06** when they're talking about their relationship,

**01:02:08** that reminds me of me and you a little bit.

**01:02:11** How so?

**01:02:12** Because they talk about the first time they met.

**01:02:15** So the first time that Gates and Buffett met,

**01:02:19** Bill's mom recommended that it happen.

**01:02:23** And Bill was like, I don't have the time for this,

**01:02:27** but he's important.

**01:02:28** I'll fly in and fly out.

**01:02:30** I'll give him a short period of time.

**01:02:32** But their first meeting, they were just together for hours

**01:02:35** because they just were talking and they found each other's

**01:02:38** brains so fascinating.

**01:02:40** And it just reminded me of how we are when we get together.

**01:02:44** Or even on our first meeting, where we'd never met before,

**01:02:49** we'd never spoken, but we just spent hours just talking.

**01:02:52** Yeah, that's right.

**01:02:53** We spent a long time together, that very first one,

**01:02:55** which I think was probably scheduled for me for like,

**01:02:58** I'll spend an hour.

**01:02:59** And I think we spent the whole day together.

**01:03:01** Yeah, like you were kind of the Bill in that, right?

**01:03:03** Where it was like, I don't know what Warren Buffett was feeling,

**01:03:06** but kind of just like, I'll see what it's like.

**01:03:09** Just the way that they describe some of the stuff

**01:03:11** in their relationship is just like,

**01:03:12** they understand each other and they become friends

**01:03:16** because they understand each other's brains work.

**01:03:18** And there aren't a lot of other people

**01:03:20** that they've necessarily met in their lives

**01:03:22** where their brains work similarly enough

**01:03:24** that they can challenge each other and find it interesting.

**01:03:27** And it just reminded me of how we are a little bit,

**01:03:31** which I just thought was, obviously I thought that was nice.

**01:03:33** You returned, Nal, on that one probably, but that's fine.

**01:03:37** Well, I'm not going to play bridge with you,

**01:03:39** if that's what you're, if that's what you're asking.

**01:03:41** I don't know how to play bridge.

**01:03:42** But it's interesting because of the way

**01:03:45** that they are friends and they also refer to as partners

**01:03:48** because Buffett pledged half of his wealth

**01:03:51** to the Gates Foundation, right?

**01:03:53** Yeah.

**01:03:53** And it's interesting to hear how he talks about,

**01:03:56** like Bill says it's worse for him really

**01:04:00** to feel like he's losing Warren's money than his own.

**01:04:02** Oh, I know.

**01:04:04** That's brutal.

**01:04:05** And I totally, like I feel Gates so much on that.

**01:04:11** There is a way in which,

**01:04:13** and I think you can see it on his face

**01:04:15** at a couple of little moments where it's just like,

**01:04:18** it's a real responsibility

**01:04:21** to spend another billionaire's fortune.

**01:04:24** That's almost an inconceivable amount of,

**01:04:28** I don't want to say burden,

**01:04:29** but like it's almost an inconceivable amount of exchange

**01:04:33** between two people of like the wealth

**01:04:37** that Warren Buffett has built up over a lifetime,

**01:04:40** passed on into the hands of Gates to manage.

**01:04:44** Like I don't think I could psychologically deal with that.

**01:04:48** I'm like, oh God, it's okay if I lose my own billions,

**01:04:51** but if I lose Warren Buffett's billions, that's terrible.

**01:04:54** That's a terrible situation to be in.

**01:04:56** Because it's like, it's difficult, they're friends.

**01:04:58** Yeah, or even just like Buffett wants an update on like,

**01:05:02** what's the situation with polio?

**01:05:03** How's that going?

**01:05:04** Like, what do we think the odds are

**01:05:05** on actually being able to get it down to zero?

**01:05:08** It's come back.

**01:05:10** Yeah, that's a very different conversation

**01:05:13** if the two of you are just hanging out and talking

**01:05:16** as billionaire buddies and bridge partners versus,

**01:05:20** oh, also you're spending all of my money

**01:05:22** on this polio problem too.

**01:05:24** Like, oh God.

**01:05:25** But I could watch the two of them interact all day long.

**01:05:29** It's just something about it that was charming, but weird.

**01:05:32** They're like, they're in the recliner,

**01:05:34** why are they in that store?

**01:05:35** Why are they sitting on recliner chairs?

**01:05:37** Like, who made that happen?

**01:05:39** Why is that happening?

**01:05:41** Does that doing this like thing in a kitchen,

**01:05:44** like it's just really strange.

**01:05:46** Yeah, it's really strange.

**01:05:48** And even just my wife laughed out loud

**01:05:51** because she was like, what are these two?

**01:05:52** They're just sitting in a diner, like this is what they do.

**01:05:55** Bill Gates flies to Omaha and they just go to like

**01:05:58** some random diner sitting in the booth.

**01:06:01** And it's just, it's like, okay,

**01:06:03** what's the total net value represented by the two seats

**01:06:06** in this booth in a diner in Omaha?

**01:06:09** It's something intrinsically absurd about it.

**01:06:11** I mean, I can't imagine they are actually doing that

**01:06:14** because like Berkshire Hathaway owns that town, right?

**01:06:18** They must have restaurants at the office.

**01:06:20** I don't know, like I don't know a lot about Warren Buffett,

**01:06:24** but like if they're just going to that regular bridge club,

**01:06:27** I can totally believe that the man who wants to pour half

**01:06:31** a container of salt on his burger also just has some diner

**01:06:34** that he's been going to for 50 years

**01:06:36** where he likes the burger.

**01:06:37** I guess.

**01:06:38** Like I find it very believable that that's really

**01:06:40** what they're doing, you know?

**01:06:42** And Gates is like, yeah, we have to go to this diner

**01:06:44** because it's the only one that Warren will eat at.

**01:06:46** Like I can, that is trivially easy for me to believe.

**01:06:51** But yeah, did you hear me Netflix?

**01:06:52** This is what I want.

**01:06:53** I want the show with the two of them.

**01:06:56** I don't care what they're doing.

**01:06:57** I just want it.

**01:06:58** Anything.

**01:06:59** Yeah, anything.

**01:07:01** This episode is also brought to you by Hover,

**01:07:04** one of Cortex's longest running sponsors.

**01:07:07** When you have that one great idea,

**01:07:09** where's the first place to go?

**01:07:11** For a ton of entrepreneurs, including me,

**01:07:13** Hover is that first big step because your great business,

**01:07:17** your great idea, your great project,

**01:07:19** it starts with and needs a wonderful domain name.

**01:07:22** And Hover will have it.

**01:07:47** that I have to click.

**01:07:48** And they give me really detailed instructions

**01:07:50** if I need to enter or change any records.

**01:07:53** I've always found this sort of stuff

**01:07:54** super daunting and confusing,

**01:07:56** but Hover make it so easy to do.

**01:07:58** They also have free Whois privacy,

**01:08:00** so bad guys don't get your information.

**01:08:55** So going from the micro,

**01:08:57** which is born Buffett and Bill Gates

**01:09:00** sitting in a cafe eating burgers is hilarious.

**01:09:03** To zoom all the way out to the macro.

**01:09:07** One of the things I liked about this documentary

**01:09:10** is the way it sort of focused on the way Gates thinks

**01:09:16** about problems and how to solve them.

**01:09:19** And this is the stuff that we were talking before

**01:09:22** about what is underfunded, where can you be effective?

**01:09:27** And the toilets thing, I think,

**01:09:30** is it just like a great example of this?

**01:09:33** I get the impression that this is largely what started

**01:09:38** the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation

**01:09:40** was around thinking about the problem of sanitation

**01:09:44** in the third world and how to solve it.

**01:09:47** But it's just, I think it's kind of fascinating

**01:09:50** to hear Gates talk a little bit about it

**01:09:53** where he's like, oh, toilets are this totally

**01:09:56** underfunded problem and they're a thing

**01:09:58** that nobody thinks about.

**01:09:59** And it's like, yeah, that's perfectly correct.

**01:10:02** Like nobody thinks about it.

**01:10:04** And what I didn't realize, and what I found interesting is

**01:10:11** like that there's no market segmentation

**01:10:13** in the world of toilets, where we only have two options,

**01:10:17** which is you live in a modern country

**01:10:20** that has billions of dollars worth of plumbing

**01:10:22** and these multimillion dollar waste treatment facilities.

**01:10:27** And you have like an incredibly complex system

**01:10:32** that keeps the water clean and nobody ever thinks about it.

**01:10:36** And then as they said, like the moment you go down

**01:10:39** from there, you're left at a pit in the ground.

**01:10:43** And it's like, there's very little that you can do

**01:10:47** in between those two extremes.

**01:10:50** And like, I just thought it was a really fascinating way

**01:10:54** to kind of think of this problem of,

**01:10:58** can you try to fund something that can exist

**01:11:03** in between these two areas?

**01:11:06** Because there's that guy who works for the aerospace company

**01:11:10** who says that there are places in the world

**01:11:12** where they have sanitation plants

**01:11:13** but don't have the money to run them.

**01:11:15** Yeah, yeah, they have the plants,

**01:11:17** they don't have the money to run them.

**01:11:18** Or the thing that I never thought about is like,

**01:11:22** oh, if you have a slum,

**01:11:24** one of the best things you could do for that slum

**01:11:26** is cleaning up the sanitation.

**01:11:29** But you can't, you just physically can't put pipes

**01:11:34** under the ground to all of the dwellings in this area.

**01:11:37** Like it would, that it would just cost more money

**01:11:39** than the country even has.

**01:11:41** It's just a good example of trying to build up something else

**01:11:48** to say like, okay, what can exist?

**01:11:51** What are our options here?

**01:11:52** And talking about the way they think through the problems

**01:11:56** of like, okay, we gotta power the toilet system somehow.

**01:11:59** Like maybe we can use the waste

**01:12:01** to power the toilet system itself.

**01:12:02** Or, oh, maybe we should just try to have

**01:12:05** some kind of composting system.

**01:12:06** Or like, what can we do?

**01:12:07** What can we do?

**01:12:09** And then on the other side,

**01:12:10** the part where you can see gates being frustrated

**01:12:13** and it comes up later with some of the nuclear power stuff

**01:12:17** of, okay, that's great.

**01:12:19** We have a toilet that's theoretically self-sufficient,

**01:12:23** but it costs $50,000 to make one of them.

**01:12:26** And we need to find suppliers who can mass produce this

**01:12:30** and bring down the price.

**01:12:31** It's like just such a horribly, horribly complex problem.

**01:12:36** And also a problem with such tremendous upside

**01:12:40** because the number they give in the documentary

**01:12:42** is like there's 4 billion people on earth

**01:12:45** without access to modern toilets.

**01:12:48** It's like, man, even if this has been a 10-year project

**01:12:52** that has been really hard to try to solve,

**01:12:54** it's like the upside is tremendous if you can solve this.

**01:13:00** And I wouldn't be surprised if still to this day,

**01:13:03** like the Gates Foundation is one of the very few people

**01:13:06** trying to work on this problem of how do we construct

**01:13:11** and build and roll out cheap toilet

**01:13:16** and sanitation systems in the world?

**01:13:18** And it's a great example of like the marginal dollar

**01:13:24** of like where can Bill Gates direct his resources

**01:13:27** to try to make a maximal impact for something

**01:13:30** that hopefully you can find as a somewhat cheap solution.

**01:13:34** You know, again, this is where I wish the documentary

**01:13:36** had gone in a little bit more detail

**01:13:38** because I don't quite understand

**01:13:40** what is the current state of this project,

**01:13:43** but it definitely seems to me like a great area

**01:13:45** to put all the resources in.

**01:13:47** And it was just similar also thinking of polio

**01:13:50** as a little bit of a reverse case

**01:13:53** where it's not that people aren't focused

**01:13:57** on trying to get rid of polio,

**01:13:59** but I loved one quote in particular where Gates says,

**01:14:02** the thing about polio is that getting to zero cases

**01:14:06** is magic because once you get down to zero cases,

**01:14:10** it saves you all of the future costs forever.

**01:14:14** And I think that's another example of thinking about

**01:14:19** a problem in the world in a sort of unsympathetic,

**01:14:24** uncharitable cost way, but it's again like an excellent

**01:14:29** point of like why is polio a thing that you really wanna try

**01:14:32** to attack?

**01:14:34** And it's because unlike some other problems,

**01:14:36** if we can just solve it all the way once,

**01:14:40** it's a problem that you can just take off the board

**01:14:43** for humanity of like, we never have to think

**01:14:45** about this again.

**01:14:46** Goodbye polio, and we don't have to forever

**01:14:51** invest resources into maintaining this situation

**01:14:54** because it's just done and it's just resolved.

**01:14:57** And it's also very, very frustrating watching

**01:15:01** as a viewer to realize like, oh my God,

**01:15:04** like we've gotten it so close,

**01:15:07** but there's just like three areas in the world

**01:15:11** where you can't get it down to zero

**01:15:13** and it's just logistically difficult.

**01:15:16** Oh, there are just things that happen that there's no way

**01:15:18** he can work against like terrorism, war.

**01:15:21** Yeah, but that's what I mean is like,

**01:15:23** oh, you have like these terrorist controlled regions

**01:15:26** in the world and like those are the last holdouts for polio

**01:15:30** and you just can't do anything, but it's like,

**01:15:32** it feels tantalizingly close of like,

**01:15:35** if we can just get it to zero,

**01:15:37** what a tremendous, tremendous benefit for all of humanity.

**01:15:41** What I like about them, like with Bill and Melinda

**01:15:44** in this case is they don't give up.

**01:15:46** Like they, in fact, after all this they invest more money.

**01:15:49** So we have to put more into it.

**01:15:51** Yeah, yeah, yeah, there's a great,

**01:15:53** another great line that I really like is where Gates talks

**01:15:56** about the people he's working with coming to him

**01:15:58** and asking for more money and they ask

**01:15:59** for like a hundred million dollars more.

**01:16:01** And he's like, I think you asked the maximum

**01:16:03** that you think you can ask for,

**01:16:05** not the actual amount it's going to take to solve this.

**01:16:08** As like, you need $400 million.

**01:16:10** Which is quite a difference.

**01:16:13** Yeah, which is quite a difference, but it's also again,

**01:16:16** like being clever and trying to read the human situation

**01:16:20** of, you know, this is someone coming to me

**01:16:23** with a number that already seems astronomical

**01:16:27** and to fund something, not to the level

**01:16:30** where you actually solve the problem is worse

**01:16:33** than spending four times as much money on it

**01:16:36** and hopefully actually accomplishing your goal.

**01:16:38** The last episode is focused on nuclear energy.

**01:16:42** This is the thing that I wasn't really aware

**01:16:44** that Gates was working on until I saw this documentary.

**01:16:46** Yeah, I never heard of it.

**01:16:48** Yeah, he's, he created a startup called Terra Power

**01:16:51** and they're effectively working on creating a new type

**01:16:56** of nuclear energy plant, which obviously comes

**01:16:58** with a lot of baggage and they address that.

**01:17:01** Like they show the Fukushima reactor leak

**01:17:04** was like a big part of it in 2011,

**01:17:06** where there was like a massive earthquake

**01:17:08** kind of tsunami and the reactor exploded

**01:17:11** and it was, you know, terrifying.

**01:17:13** But they were talking about there being a lot

**01:17:15** of bad choices in the way that these reactors were made.

**01:17:19** And they ended up creating something

**01:17:21** which on paper sounds amazing.

**01:17:23** It's a reactor that has been designed to be fueled

**01:17:28** by depleted uranium, which is the waste

**01:17:33** that we've already created

**01:17:34** with other nuclear energy stuff, right?

**01:17:37** So they were saying about like,

**01:17:38** there is a waste plant in Kentucky

**01:17:40** that has enough discarded uranium to power the entire US

**01:17:43** for 125 years on their reactor system.

**01:17:47** And they talk about it being clean, efficient and safe.

**01:17:49** So I kind of wanted to get your views on it,

**01:17:51** but I need to talk about something real quick.

**01:17:54** I just have to say it because I can't not.

**01:17:56** There's a guy in this called Nathan Mirvold

**01:17:58** and he was the CTO of Microsoft

**01:18:00** and is very involved in TerraPower.

**01:18:02** I don't want to talk about this guy because-

**01:18:04** Is he the guy who wrote the book on bread

**01:18:06** or is he the venture capitalist?

**01:18:07** The guy who wrote the book on bread.

**01:18:09** Okay.

**01:18:10** Because years ago, Mirvold was connected to,

**01:18:14** and I believe part owned a patent trolling company

**01:18:18** called Lodesys.

**01:18:20** Oh, Lodesys, there's a name I haven't heard in a long time.

**01:18:24** Tried to sue a collection of iOS developers,

**01:18:27** including friends, very close friends of mine,

**01:18:31** who spent a lot of time, money and stress dealing with this.

**01:18:36** Eventually Apple stepped in and smashed it into the ground

**01:18:40** with a massive Apple size hammer.

**01:18:43** And like it went away,

**01:18:44** but it's just something that I struggle with

**01:18:48** because I know what this guy is partly responsible for

**01:18:52** and that affects me and I can't like him.

**01:18:57** So you don't want to read his book on bread?

**01:18:59** Don't want to read his book on bread.

**01:19:01** Okay.

**01:19:02** Seems like a clever guy, but also a not good person.

**01:19:06** Right, okay.

**01:19:08** Well, we don't need to discuss him then.

**01:19:11** Like I won't-

**01:19:12** And also a work of a guy called Lowell Wood

**01:19:15** who was involved in the creation of the hydrogen bomb.

**01:19:19** So like it's a real ragtag band part of this company.

**01:19:25** They did have, like there was one part

**01:19:27** that sort of made me laugh unintentionally

**01:19:29** where they, what's the other guy's name?

**01:19:31** It's Lowell.

**01:19:31** Lowell Wood.

**01:19:32** Where they introduce Lowell Wood

**01:19:34** and they make this, they have just have this sentence

**01:19:38** about how like, oh, he's this like renegade person

**01:19:41** in the nuclear power industry

**01:19:42** and lots of people don't like him

**01:19:44** for a whole bunch of reasons.

**01:19:45** And then they cut to him

**01:19:47** and he just looks kind of like a Bond villain.

**01:19:50** He looks like an absolutely evil person.

**01:19:53** And he looks like a cross between like a Bond villain

**01:19:58** and like a villain in Indiana Jones or something.

**01:20:01** Like-

**01:20:02** Yeah, maybe.

**01:20:03** I have never seen someone look more evil than this guy.

**01:20:07** He should have a mustache that he twiddles.

**01:20:10** That's the only thing he's missing.

**01:20:12** Yeah, like I don't mean to comment on his appearance,

**01:20:15** but it's just, it's so striking

**01:20:17** and particularly the way just that it's cut.

**01:20:20** I do feel a little bit like, yeah,

**01:20:22** I don't know about this guy at the table.

**01:20:24** Like maybe, maybe not.

**01:20:27** I don't know.

**01:20:28** I'm just going 100% based on looks here.

**01:20:32** Yeah, so, so yeah, I guess it is,

**01:20:34** it is this ragtag group over there.

**01:20:36** Yeah, ragtag is definitely not the right way to describe them

**01:20:41** but I couldn't think of any other phrase.

**01:20:44** I don't know. It sort of fits.

**01:20:45** It sort of fits.

**01:20:48** Yeah, cause you got like a Bond villain on one side

**01:20:51** and Nathan who's history, I didn't know,

**01:20:53** but who comes across as like a real happy nerd

**01:20:57** who also doesn't get along with the Bond villain at all.

**01:21:00** It just feels like, I don't know about this guys.

**01:21:04** He seemed, I mean, again,

**01:21:07** whatever the opposite of Rose Tenticlas,

**01:21:08** this is how I'm looking at this guy,

**01:21:10** but he looks like the worst kind of nerd to me.

**01:21:14** I didn't say if he's a good kind of nerd

**01:21:16** or a bad kind of nerd,

**01:21:17** but he comes across as a happy nerd either way, right?

**01:21:20** Like that's all I'm saying there, Mike.

**01:21:24** But I wanted to, cause I'm just intrigued.

**01:21:28** Yeah.

**01:21:29** I wanted to get your opinion on nuclear power.

**01:21:34** I don't know. It's a hard question.

**01:21:36** Because like the on paper solution

**01:21:39** that is presented in this documentary, right?

**01:21:42** Like the way that they present their,

**01:21:44** what do they call it? Traveling wave reactor.

**01:21:47** Yeah.

**01:21:48** The way it's presented is like, well, of course.

**01:21:52** Right.

**01:21:53** Right. Completely safe.

**01:21:55** No element of human error.

**01:21:58** And we have enough resources on the planet already sitting

**01:22:02** in drums that we can't get rid of to power the world.

**01:22:07** Like on paper, this sounds amazing.

**01:22:11** Yeah. I think this is always the problem

**01:22:14** with nuclear power is I agree with it on paper in this way.

**01:22:18** And I know that they must roll these statistics out a lot,

**01:22:21** but they talk about how like more people were killed

**01:22:24** by living near coal plants than nuclear plants.

**01:22:28** There is a slight issue with this statistic

**01:22:31** of like there are less nuclear plants,

**01:22:33** but yes, I get what you're saying, right?

**01:22:36** Yeah. Yeah.

**01:22:37** But even the numbers of like living near nuclear power plants,

**01:22:41** how dangerous is it?

**01:22:42** Like this, I get it.

**01:22:44** There is a little bit of like different stuff here.

**01:22:47** And there is so much truth behind the nuclear power plants

**01:22:52** that exist in the world are all terrifyingly old

**01:22:56** and their construction dates don't tell you the truth

**01:23:00** about how old the designs they're actually using are.

**01:23:03** So I do think that that is a real issue.

**01:23:06** And that is part of the nuclear power

**01:23:09** is clearly a great answer on paper.

**01:23:12** And it also like it lends to something that Bill says a lot.

**01:23:16** And he mentions it of like,

**01:23:18** I am only good in business situations

**01:23:21** where innovation is possible or needed.

**01:23:25** Right.

**01:23:26** Like he says, I am good at innovation.

**01:23:28** That's what I bring.

**01:23:29** If it is not an innovation situation, I bring nothing.

**01:23:32** And again, I like that

**01:23:33** because he is incredibly aware of himself, right?

**01:23:35** Like he knows what he's good at

**01:23:37** and will find ways to move in those circumstances.

**01:23:40** And it clearly seems from the way it's positioned

**01:23:42** in this documentary that nuclear power

**01:23:47** very much needs innovation if it's going to continue.

**01:23:50** Well, and I also like his venture capital guy

**01:23:52** makes the comment about how again

**01:23:54** the way Gates thinks about stuff,

**01:23:56** like, oh, you make a lot of friends trying to cure polio.

**01:23:59** You don't make a lot of friends

**01:24:01** trying to build nuclear power stations, right?

**01:24:03** And how from Gates's perspective

**01:24:07** that's actually a reason to go into nuclear power

**01:24:09** because it's another underfunded situation.

**01:24:14** Like who wants to be the person

**01:24:16** who's seriously dedicating a lot of time to,

**01:24:20** let's build brand new nuclear power stations now.

**01:24:22** Everyone else is too scared of it, right?

**01:24:24** They're too scared of the perception of it.

**01:24:27** Yeah, everybody else is scared of it.

**01:24:29** And even in countries

**01:24:31** that have been traditionally very pro nuclear,

**01:24:33** like a lot of them have been dismantling

**01:24:35** the nuclear power stations.

**01:24:37** So it's like, this is a world without friends.

**01:24:40** And he's also in this situation again,

**01:24:42** just like with the toilets, he has a great line of like,

**01:24:44** oh, if you're just trying to build

**01:24:45** one nuclear power station,

**01:24:47** you should just shoot yourself in the head before you start

**01:24:49** because it's gonna cost like a bazillion dollars.

**01:24:54** And I like that because he's like,

**01:24:56** oh, he's in the wholesale nuclear power plant

**01:24:59** construction business.

**01:25:00** Like, oh boy, that sounds really hard.

**01:25:04** That sounds really, really hard.

**01:25:06** But so like, I don't have a strong opinion

**01:25:08** on nuclear power.

**01:25:09** I'm sort of theoretically for,

**01:25:12** but some smart people who are closer to the topic

**01:25:16** than I am, who I've talked to,

**01:25:18** are of the opinion that yes, it's great on paper,

**01:25:24** but we should probably take the resources

**01:25:26** that we would spend on trying to build

**01:25:30** nuclear power plants and do other things with it.

**01:25:33** Just that it's a difficult,

**01:25:35** it's actually not a good place

**01:25:37** for marginal impact of additional dollars,

**01:25:41** that there are other alternative energy sources

**01:25:44** that it would be better to scale up faster,

**01:25:47** just that like, nuclear is gonna take too long

**01:25:49** also considering regulatory burdens.

**01:25:52** All the practicalities of actual life,

**01:25:55** the pushback you would get from people,

**01:25:56** even if you have a system that's safer,

**01:25:59** nobody cares and nobody wants to hear about that.

**01:26:01** Like, they just know like,

**01:26:03** oh, you wanna build another nuclear power station.

**01:26:05** So I don't know, I think on paper it might be great,

**01:26:09** but in real life it has a bunch of real difficulties

**01:26:13** that may have nothing to do with how good or not good

**01:26:17** the solution actually is.

**01:26:19** So I don't know, I don't really have strong opinions

**01:26:21** one way or the other.

**01:26:23** I mean, would you want a nuclear power plant

**01:26:24** to go up behind Mega Studio?

**01:26:26** Right, but I also wouldn't want any type of plant.

**01:26:29** Right, you want nothing now.

**01:26:31** Now you're an NIMBY person as soon as you go to office.

**01:26:33** I don't want coal to go up or an oil processing plant

**01:26:37** or anything behind anywhere I am.

**01:26:39** A wind turbine that you have to...

**01:26:41** I don't want it, no, that's gonna cause disruption to me.

**01:26:44** Right.

**01:26:45** Saying that I don't want those things in general

**01:26:47** is not correct, but nobody wants them in their backyard.

**01:26:52** Right, of course.

**01:26:52** That's just like not a thing that anybody wants

**01:26:54** because it's going to affect you somehow

**01:26:56** or you're gonna be scared of it affecting you, right?

**01:26:58** Yeah.

**01:26:59** I mean, my feeling is like,

**01:27:01** if what they are saying is true about their plant,

**01:27:05** if they are what they say they are,

**01:27:08** I have no problem with him investing his money into it

**01:27:10** because I am also aware of the fact that he is investing

**01:27:13** his money into other renewable resource stuff.

**01:27:16** So if that's the case, then why not do both?

**01:27:19** Because even if you only built a couple of them

**01:27:22** and then all it did was use up the nuclear waste

**01:27:25** that's been generated, that is a net good to the world.

**01:27:28** Yeah, yeah.

**01:27:29** Right?

**01:27:30** Yeah.

**01:27:30** So what I'm gonna give as I say it is,

**01:27:31** and it won't have reactor meltdowns,

**01:27:35** which the way it's explained to me, I understand it.

**01:27:38** All right, I can see why you say that safer

**01:27:40** because the way that you've explained it to me

**01:27:41** compared to what is currently out there in the world,

**01:27:43** that makes sense.

**01:27:44** Like if you could give this another name,

**01:27:47** people wouldn't freak out about it.

**01:27:49** Right.

**01:27:50** Yeah, maybe don't call them nuclear power plants.

**01:27:53** Right, because it's like,

**01:27:55** it seems like it doesn't have the same set of problems

**01:27:59** that current nuclear energy does

**01:28:01** because it's using the waste.

**01:28:04** So it's not even like at its most potent, right?

**01:28:07** Like they talk about using liquid called metal,

**01:28:10** which could never get hot enough

**01:28:12** because the boiling point is so high.

**01:28:14** I think they kind of say we'd have other problems

**01:28:17** if that was the situation, right?

**01:28:19** That like this is gonna start to boil.

**01:28:21** Like you're not gonna care

**01:28:21** about the reactor exploding at that point.

**01:28:24** So it's like the way that they explain it all,

**01:28:26** it's like, well, this all makes sense.

**01:28:27** If it is as good as they say it is,

**01:28:29** why not have these as well?

**01:28:32** But of course, I don't know that.

**01:28:34** I'm sure that when original nuclear power plants

**01:28:36** were invented, they were perfectly safe

**01:28:39** based on what was being said, right?

**01:28:41** My point is if what they are saying is true,

**01:28:44** I have no problem with it.

**01:28:45** Yeah.

**01:28:46** But I can't validate that.

**01:28:47** Yeah.

**01:28:48** I'm not smart enough.

**01:28:49** I don't have enough physics knowledge

**01:28:50** to be able to validate if those power plants are safe.

**01:28:53** Yeah.

**01:28:54** I have enough physics knowledge to be able to say,

**01:28:58** I can believe them that they're correct,

**01:29:01** which is slightly different.

**01:29:02** Like they're not saying things or making claims

**01:29:04** that strike me as crazy, right?

**01:29:07** Or against the laws of thermodynamics.

**01:29:10** It's like, yeah, that seems plausible.

**01:29:11** But we also only know what we know right now.

**01:29:14** Exactly.

**01:29:15** And then it's like in 45 years, they're like,

**01:29:17** oh crap, depleted uranium's worse.

**01:29:20** That is very unlikely.

**01:29:21** But you could run into a problem of like,

**01:29:23** oh, the tips on the coolant cores

**01:29:26** are made of the wrong material

**01:29:27** and we just didn't know, right?

**01:29:29** That kind of problem.

**01:29:30** So yeah, I don't know.

**01:29:31** But boy, is that a problem that is not an easy one

**01:29:33** and is quite the thing to take on.

**01:29:36** And I just didn't have any idea.

**01:29:38** Not that matters anyway,

**01:29:39** because they can't build them, right?

**01:29:42** At least that's where it was left

**01:29:43** because of the issue with the American

**01:29:45** and Chinese governments right now.

**01:29:47** Right.

**01:29:48** You can't build them.

**01:29:49** So, this big wah-wah sound at the end of that section.

**01:29:53** That was one of those things where like,

**01:29:54** this comes up a few times in the documentary of like,

**01:29:59** while we were saying Bill Gates is not inspiring,

**01:30:04** he clearly has a way of being able to get people

**01:30:08** to do what he wants

**01:30:09** because he's able to convince the Chinese government

**01:30:11** to work with him.

**01:30:12** They talk about earlier,

**01:30:13** like when he goes in to talk to all of these leaders

**01:30:16** in Nigeria and gets them to agree to allow for his vaccines.

**01:30:22** Yeah.

**01:30:22** One of my favorite ones is the aerospace owner guy.

**01:30:26** Like this guy's building like military contracts and planes

**01:30:29** and Bill somehow convinced him to build a sanitation plant.

**01:30:33** Like, how did that even happen?

**01:30:35** Yeah, that is, I forgot about that where he's like,

**01:30:37** oh yeah, I'm building top secret equipment

**01:30:39** for the military and Gates shows up and like,

**01:30:41** hi, how about you build toilets?

**01:30:43** And he goes, okay, sure.

**01:30:45** Right, like Bill Gates has the ability to convince people

**01:30:49** to do what he wants them to do.

**01:30:51** And I just find that very intriguing, right?

**01:30:55** That he has that power,

**01:30:58** because it's clearly not money, right?

**01:30:59** Like I don't think it's money a lot of the time

**01:31:02** in some of these situations.

**01:31:03** I have a thought about that though.

**01:31:05** Okay.

**01:31:06** Because this again is like we were saying before about,

**01:31:10** Steve Jobs has like a reality distortion field

**01:31:13** and there's a way in which if a thing doesn't exist,

**01:31:17** you can inspire people to move in a direction

**01:31:19** and you can make it become so.

**01:31:22** Yeah, out of raw charisma.

**01:31:23** Yeah, out of raw charisma.

**01:31:24** But I think that that is limited

**01:31:28** to very particular kinds of problems.

**01:31:32** And that sort of charisma does not work

**01:31:36** for the sorts of problems that Gates is up against.

**01:31:39** Nuclear power does not yield to a really charismatic dude

**01:31:43** trying to convince people to work together on a problem.

**01:31:47** Okay.

**01:31:47** Right, like you're up against the laws of the universe here.

**01:31:51** And in a lesser way, but I think it's the same thing,

**01:31:55** polio and toilets, they're the same kind of thing.

**01:31:59** Like people are getting infected

**01:32:02** and water is dirty or it isn't.

**01:32:05** And an economical way to fix this

**01:32:07** or to cure this exists or it doesn't.

**01:32:11** And what I suspect,

**01:32:13** because there's a little thing where Bill Gates talks,

**01:32:16** I normally have no patience at all

**01:32:18** for people talking about their childhood,

**01:32:20** but there's a little section where Bill Gates talks

**01:32:22** about how he was having this really difficult relationship

**01:32:25** with his parents and the whole family goes off to therapy

**01:32:28** and they pretend like, oh, we are all going to therapy,

**01:32:31** but actually Bill needs to go to therapy.

**01:32:33** And he and his mom need to work stuff out.

**01:32:36** But there's a part which like struck me as interesting

**01:32:38** and made me think about these later parts.

**01:32:42** So Gates says a couple of things and he says,

**01:32:45** oh, my main problem was I felt

**01:32:47** that my parents authority was arbitrary,

**01:32:50** which is absolutely unbelievable.

**01:32:53** Like as a phrase, because it's so true

**01:32:58** and it is fascinating that a child could work that out.

**01:33:03** Yeah, but that's also again, like man Gates,

**01:33:06** do I feel you in this moment of like, I get it.

**01:33:10** Like that feeling of like my parents authority is arbitrary.

**01:33:15** Like this school system is arbitrary.

**01:33:17** Like I think there's a way in which like you can imagine

**01:33:21** a young Bill Gates having a really hard time

**01:33:23** with some of that stuff.

**01:33:24** Yeah, cause like he understood how everything worked.

**01:33:29** Everyone was pretending, but he was smarter than everyone

**01:33:32** and had to just go along with it all.

**01:33:34** Yeah, so it goes from there to he says,

**01:33:37** oh, I'm at war with my parents.

**01:33:39** And then he's talking about the therapist

**01:33:40** that he was working with.

**01:33:41** And the therapist says, oh, but this isn't a fair war

**01:33:45** because you're gonna hurt your parents way more

**01:33:47** than they hurt you.

**01:33:49** Like your framing of this as a war is totally wrong.

**01:33:52** And so Gates then describes how like,

**01:33:54** oh, what a brilliant tactic this therapist took.

**01:33:58** And that he needed a little while to be convinced,

**01:34:01** but this basically unraveled the whole problem, right?

**01:34:04** That he was convinced on this.

**01:34:07** And I think there's something very interesting here

**01:34:09** because it's like that therapist may have had

**01:34:13** the one thing he could have possibly said

**01:34:16** to a young Bill Gates that would be effective,

**01:34:19** which is as Gates describes a convincing response

**01:34:24** that like, yeah, your parents authority is arbitrary.

**01:34:28** And yeah, you are in a fight with them,

**01:34:30** but here's other things that like

**01:34:33** you might not have considered.

**01:34:34** And then Bill Gates kind of changes his mind.

**01:34:36** Yeah, it's like if you care about them,

**01:34:38** which he obviously did, right?

**01:34:40** Like you have to understand

**01:34:42** that what you're doing, like it's weighted all wrong.

**01:34:48** Like you shouldn't do this, right?

**01:34:50** Like it is fascinating.

**01:34:51** The reason I mentioned this is because I think like

**01:34:55** with the aerospace guy or with being friends

**01:34:59** with Warren Buffett or convincing people to work on polio

**01:35:02** or nuclear power or anything else.

**01:35:05** What I suspect is that this is not any kind of charisma

**01:35:09** in the Steve Jobs sense.

**01:35:11** I think Bill Gates is simply finding the people

**01:35:16** who respond very well to these kinds of arguments

**01:35:21** about impact per dollar unit time spent.

**01:35:25** And so I kind of think that's what's occurring here

**01:35:30** is it's not that he was able to like convince anyone

**01:35:35** to start building toilets.

**01:35:38** It's that the same person who is in charge

**01:35:41** of this manufacturing facility for secret government stuff

**01:35:45** is susceptible to, oh, I never thought about this.

**01:35:49** Like that's a really convincing argument

**01:35:51** that one of the ways I should spend my time

**01:35:53** to have maximum impact is actually working on toilets.

**01:35:56** And so that's what I'm going to do.

**01:35:58** Or the same thing with polio

**01:36:00** or the same thing with nuclear power.

**01:36:02** I think it's that that like some people

**01:36:05** will just really respond to,

**01:36:08** oh, I've never heard this before as an argument.

**01:36:11** And it's super convincing for a kind of logical person.

**01:36:16** And this is now what I'm gonna work on.

**01:36:18** So that's my guess about how he's able

**01:36:20** to get people to do stuff.

**01:36:23** I don't imagine that he has greater powers

**01:36:29** than a regular celebrity would have.

**01:36:33** I mentioned that partly because I have to get this

**01:36:36** before we finish on the record.

**01:36:37** But I totally hate a little bit of the way

**01:36:40** that the documentary ends because the narrator says like,

**01:36:44** oh, it's really easy to be carried away

**01:36:47** by someone who wants to change the world.

**01:36:49** And I think he's kind of talking about Gates

**01:36:51** like Gates is this inspiring figure.

**01:36:55** But I just don't think that he's that sort of person.

**01:37:01** I think he's the sort of person

**01:37:02** that some people react very strongly to, but not others.

**01:37:06** And I think it's horrifically unfair how he says to Gates,

**01:37:10** he's like, oh, you're trying to cure polio,

**01:37:13** but cases are up this year.

**01:37:15** So are you able to achieve what you want to achieve?

**01:37:18** It's like, dude, yes, cases are up this year

**01:37:22** after a decade of decline and narrowing it down

**01:37:26** to the smallest possible area.

**01:37:28** And I know, but he's wrapping it up.

**01:37:30** But it's like a good wrap up because three things.

**01:37:32** But I don't think it's, no, I don't think it's a good wrap up.

**01:37:35** It's not a good wrap up because it's not fair.

**01:37:37** The three things he's focusing on are not working.

**01:37:41** Right? That's the wrap up.

**01:37:43** The wrap up is like what he's trying to get Bill to say

**01:37:45** is what he says, which is like, Bill's like, yeah,

**01:37:48** but I'm just going to keep going.

**01:37:49** Yeah.

**01:37:50** But that's the inspiring message at the end of it though.

**01:37:52** Right? No, no, no, but it's no, but it's not.

**01:37:54** Here's the thing.

**01:37:55** He undercuts that as well, because he says like,

**01:37:57** oh, Bill Gates gives the answer that he always gives,

**01:38:00** which is to work harder.

**01:38:01** And that's his greatest thing.

**01:38:03** But I've also come to see that quote,

**01:38:05** that diehard relentlessness is also his flaw.

**01:38:07** And it's like, fuck you, right?

**01:38:09** Like how many kids don't have polio because of Bill Gates?

**01:38:14** It just made me so furious.

**01:38:16** Okay. I get that.

**01:38:17** Oh, I'm sorry.

**01:38:18** He didn't solve nuclear power for you.

**01:38:20** And maybe the toilet problem isn't fixed.

**01:38:23** Yeah. Call me when hundreds of thousands of children

**01:38:27** have been spared a crippling disease because of you, right?

**01:38:31** Like even if, oh, Bill Gates only has half a success

**01:38:36** because polio hasn't been completely eradicated.

**01:38:39** It's still such an incredible accomplishment

**01:38:42** beyond what almost any human will ever do.

**01:38:46** It's like, yeah, I'm still going to count that as great.

**01:38:49** And I just, I feel like it ends on this undercutting of,

**01:38:53** of like, oh, well, you know, people are following him

**01:38:56** because he's inspiring, but where has it gone?

**01:38:58** Not, not very much so far.

**01:39:00** Like I just hated it so much.

**01:39:02** I hated that.

**01:39:03** Like the last couple of lines from the narrator so intensely.

**01:39:09** I mean, I can see it.

**01:39:10** I didn't get that kind of feeling from it,

**01:39:12** but I can, I can understand that feeling.

**01:39:15** I just had to get it on record.

**01:39:16** Because like, I kind of came away from it of just like,

**01:39:19** I feel sorry for Gates that like he wanted to have been able

**01:39:24** to achieve the ultimate success,

**01:39:29** but hasn't been able to get there yet

**01:39:31** with the things that he's focused on,

**01:39:33** like has made massive strides,

**01:39:36** but none of these things have gotten to where he wants, right?

**01:39:39** Cause like he's had to put more money into all of them,

**01:39:43** you know?

**01:39:44** And I completely agree with you.

**01:39:46** Like the things that him and Melinda have done

**01:39:49** have made the world better overall,

**01:39:53** but like they haven't yet been able to achieve

**01:39:56** the things that they set out for.

**01:40:00** But it doesn't mean they won't.

**01:40:01** But the documentarian just decided to wrap it up

**01:40:03** with that quote, I guess.

**01:40:05** I totally hated it.

**01:40:07** Look, I'm not taking that hate away from you.

**01:40:09** But I do love that like it's Gates' mom gets the final word

**01:40:13** of like, oh, I forget exactly what she says,

**01:40:16** but something about like, oh, the thing that matters

**01:40:18** not as like who you are now, but it, you know,

**01:40:20** like who you become.

**01:40:22** I was like, I'm pretty sure she'd be very happy

**01:40:25** with the results of what her son has accomplished.

**01:40:28** And so that's, I'm very glad that she got the last word

**01:40:32** in the documentary.

**01:40:33** Yeah, it was really nice.

**01:40:34** I did wanna just touch on Bill and Melinda a little bit,

**01:40:38** like their relationship, cause it is fascinating.

**01:40:41** She is hilarious.

**01:40:43** Like the start of the second episode where they ask like,

**01:40:47** what do you think his brain is like?

**01:40:49** And she just loses it, right?

**01:40:51** Cause it's just like trying to understand how chaotic

**01:40:55** she thinks his brain is and like trying to imagine

**01:40:59** living in that brain feels like hell for her in a way,

**01:41:01** like just there is no way, there is no way

**01:41:04** that I could do with it.

**01:41:05** But, you know, I just, I like their partnership.

**01:41:09** I think it's just, it's kind of interesting.

**01:41:11** I really appreciate the equality in it, you know?

**01:41:15** And obviously it seemed too difficult at first, right?

**01:41:17** Because she was very private and didn't want to be

**01:41:21** in the public eye, but then that meant that everybody

**01:41:24** ignored her in the foundation.

**01:41:27** That if she didn't want to be seen and only Bill

**01:41:30** was doing the press, people would forget about her.

**01:41:32** So she had to make the decision to become more public

**01:41:36** and it moved on from there.

**01:41:37** I just thought it was really nice to see just how strongly

**01:41:40** he values her as well.

**01:41:41** Yeah, they seem really well suited to each other.

**01:41:44** Yeah, and I found that quite inspiring, honestly,

**01:41:47** like the equality that they have and the way that he really

**01:41:52** needs her, she really needs him, like they're in it,

**01:41:54** they are like a very tight unit.

**01:41:57** I just found that really, just like really heartwarming.

**01:42:00** And I'm pleased that she was as involved in the documentary

**01:42:03** as she was, because I thought it was very,

**01:42:06** it was very important as well to see that like,

**01:42:09** she has clearly made an impact on him.

**01:42:12** Oh yeah, yeah for sure.

**01:42:13** And like cooled him down.

**01:42:14** There was one thing I did want to mention just about like

**01:42:18** the way that he would be at work where he said that he knew

**01:42:20** the license plates, everybody's license plates,

**01:42:23** and would walk through the parking lot to see who was

**01:42:25** in the office, man.

**01:42:27** And oh, and he said, everyone can work part time.

**01:42:30** You just choose the 12 hours you want to work.

**01:42:33** That's also the younger person of hissing line about,

**01:42:37** oh, I work all the time and I love it,

**01:42:39** but I don't force that on anybody.

**01:42:41** And it's like, hmm.

**01:42:42** Yeah, sure.

**01:42:43** Maybe you don't force it on anybody,

**01:42:45** but the guy who's walking around saying that,

**01:42:46** he has a different set of expectations.

**01:42:49** Yeah, yeah.

**01:42:49** It's like, it's a little bit hard to square with,

**01:42:51** oh, I also know everybody's license plate

**01:42:54** and I'm always keeping an eye on who's at the office,

**01:42:55** but you know, I don't force working harder on you.

**01:42:58** It's like, yeah, it might not be written on paper anywhere,

**01:43:03** but don't leave at five o'clock probably.

**01:43:06** So yeah, I really enjoyed it.

**01:43:07** I thought it was a great documentary

**01:43:08** and please, you seem to enjoy it too.

**01:43:10** Yeah, I mean, obviously there's things I didn't like

**01:43:12** about it, but I would totally recommend it.

**01:43:13** I think it's really well made and it's really interesting.

**01:43:17** So yeah, I'd give it two thumbs up.

**01:43:19** I think it was a good recommendation.

**01:43:20** Yeah, I'm pleased that he did it.

**01:43:22** I just think it's interesting to find out stuff

**01:43:25** about these kinds of people,

**01:43:26** because he's unique really.

**01:43:29** Yeah.

**01:43:30** We're never gonna see this about Steve Jobs.

**01:43:31** Yeah.

**01:43:32** You know, like Wozniak is not the kind of guy

**01:43:35** that would do this.

**01:43:37** So really you've kind of just got Bill.

**01:43:39** Yeah.

**01:43:40** So getting him to talk about his life is important.

**01:43:44** It is important for history.

**01:43:46** Yeah, no, I agree.

**01:43:47** There are like three or four people

**01:43:50** that are responsible for changing the world

**01:43:52** to where we are now.

**01:43:55** And he's basically one of the only ones

**01:43:57** that will say anything.

**01:43:59** Yeah.

**01:44:00** And it's important to hear.
