# Cortex - 148: State of the Apps 2024
**00:00:00** Welcome back to State of the Apps.

**00:00:01** State of the Apps.

**00:00:02** 2024 edition.

**00:00:04** Every year on State of the Apps,

**00:00:06** we talk about the tools and services

**00:00:08** that we use to manage our work and our lives.

**00:00:11** We've been doing this for many years now.

**00:00:14** I'm absolutely horrified because I was like,

**00:00:16** wait a minute.

**00:00:17** And I just Googled myself, right?

**00:00:19** CGP Grey, State of the Apps.

**00:00:21** When did I do this?

**00:00:22** And I wrote that article in 2014.

**00:00:26** So...

**00:00:27** Yeah, I didn't want to mention it.

**00:00:28** I did look this up that it has been a decade

**00:00:31** since you wrote the article on your blog

**00:00:34** that became the reason that we do this episode.

**00:00:37** 10 years of State of the Apps for me.

**00:00:39** Oh my God.

**00:00:41** Well, I think there was a gap of like two or three years

**00:00:44** where there wasn't another one.

**00:00:45** And then I was like, that's a good idea.

**00:00:47** Let's do an episode of Cortex about it.

**00:00:49** And then here we are.

**00:00:51** I'm doing a quick scroll down the list

**00:00:53** of how many of these apps have still survived.

**00:00:55** And the answer is not zero.

**00:00:57** That's surprising.

**00:00:58** You know what?

**00:00:58** It might be fun actually, throughout this episode,

**00:01:01** considering we are on like the decade of State of the Apps.

**00:01:05** If there's any that you picked today

**00:01:07** that are on that original list,

**00:01:09** I think it would be fun if you mentioned that.

**00:01:10** One that's definitely not Evernote.

**00:01:13** Were you positive in 2014 about Evernote?

**00:01:18** Okay, here's what I wrote in 2014.

**00:01:20** Evernote is my dumping ground

**00:01:22** for lots of random video related pre-research.

**00:01:25** I use it, but reluctantly.

**00:01:29** The real shock of today's episode

**00:01:30** is if Evernote's found its way back.

**00:01:32** Anything could happen.

**00:01:33** Hold on to your seats, everyone.

**00:01:36** The traditional way of starting State of the Apps

**00:01:39** is with home screens.

**00:01:40** Home screens.

**00:01:42** Although now it's home screens and lock screens.

**00:01:45** Yeah.

**00:01:46** And focus modes.

**00:01:46** And I think also standby this year.

**00:01:49** There's a lot in this now.

**00:01:51** I mean, Mike, what even is a home screen anymore?

**00:01:55** Honestly, that is becoming a harder and harder question.

**00:01:57** It totally is becoming a strange kind of question

**00:02:00** about what is the home screen?

**00:02:01** What do we mean by this?

**00:02:02** Yeah.

**00:02:03** Like as well, from this year with interactive widgets,

**00:02:07** home screens aren't even just static thing anymore.

**00:02:10** They're not just a launcher anymore.

**00:02:12** They are actually a place to perform actions.

**00:02:16** Yeah, I haven't a ton of apps

**00:02:18** that are doing interactive widgets yet,

**00:02:20** but it is suddenly realizing like the home screen

**00:02:23** is an app now, kind of?

**00:02:26** Like that's clearly the direction it's going into.

**00:02:29** So what even is a home screen?

**00:02:31** How is it connected to focus modes

**00:02:33** and your watch and everything else?

**00:02:35** It's like it's all kind of getting muddled together

**00:02:38** and also partly being apps at the same time.

**00:02:42** So what do your home screens look like, Mike?

**00:02:44** Right, well, let's start with my regular home screen.

**00:02:47** Okay.

**00:02:48** This is like the default home screen.

**00:02:49** I also use these set of home screens for Do Not Disturb.

**00:02:53** And I've also included the corresponding lock screens

**00:02:57** for these home screens in the image.

**00:02:59** So you can kind of get the whole view.

**00:03:01** Yes, that's always so overwhelming

**00:03:03** when I click on one of these links

**00:03:05** to see all of Mike's things.

**00:03:07** It's a visual treat.

**00:03:08** It's a little experience.

**00:03:10** It is visual.

**00:03:11** That is true, yes.

**00:03:12** Visual treat.

**00:03:13** Yes.

**00:03:14** I've gone way more widget focused this year.

**00:03:18** For a long time, I had like big widget on the top

**00:03:22** and I had a little widget in the corner

**00:03:24** and then I had like 12 apps.

**00:03:26** This year, I've actually reduced my apps to eight

**00:03:30** and I have two square widgets

**00:03:32** and the large widget on the top.

**00:03:34** And this is because of interactive widgets.

**00:03:37** So the widget I wanted to kind of like blow up everything for

**00:03:41** was the Do widget.

**00:03:43** Tell me about your use case of Do

**00:03:44** because Do is one of these apps that for me

**00:03:46** has disappeared over the years

**00:03:50** because mainly for me,

**00:03:51** I was looking for an app years ago related to timers

**00:03:54** but that also had really good shortcut support.

**00:03:57** So previous lightning round pick for me

**00:03:59** was an app called Just Timers

**00:04:01** which I'm still using to this day.

**00:04:03** Fantastic timer shortcut support, really good.

**00:04:06** And that just blew Do out of the water for me.

**00:04:09** It's like, oh, I just never used it again.

**00:04:11** So it looks like you're actually using it

**00:04:13** as a task manager here.

**00:04:15** Like what's your use case for this?

**00:04:16** Okay, so the types of tasks that go into Do

**00:04:20** are always personal focused.

**00:04:23** Okay.

**00:04:24** So I use Todoist as my to do app

**00:04:26** which I'll talk about a little bit later on in the show.

**00:04:29** And I have a personal project in Todoist

**00:04:33** but therefore like quite large things.

**00:04:36** The stuff that goes into Do

**00:04:37** are very simple, often recurring tasks.

**00:04:41** So for example, I have take out the trash,

**00:04:44** do the dishes, do my evening stretches,

**00:04:47** take my pills, text my mum,

**00:04:51** like these little things that happen on a daily basis,

**00:04:55** on a weekly basis, go in here.

**00:04:57** Like remember to set my time tracker when I go to the gym,

**00:05:02** remember to get cash out for my barbell

**00:05:04** when I see him next week, do my exercises.

**00:05:07** Like these little things that are just,

**00:05:10** I don't want all of these tasks

**00:05:13** messing up my Todoist to do list.

**00:05:16** And then also all of these types of tasks

**00:05:20** benefit from Jews nagging.

**00:05:23** That you can set in due, if I do not mark this complete,

**00:05:27** keep reminding, keep reminding.

**00:05:30** And a lot of these things,

**00:05:31** they're like, it has to be done today.

**00:05:33** So like I want the phone to keep asking me to do this stuff

**00:05:38** until it's done.

**00:05:39** Like if I don't remember to take the trash out,

**00:05:42** that's gonna be a problem.

**00:05:43** I have to take out the trash, right?

**00:05:45** So like it's going to keep telling me every 10 minutes,

**00:05:49** have you done this?

**00:05:50** Have you done this?

**00:05:51** Have you done this?

**00:05:52** So these are the kinds of things.

**00:05:53** And it can also be like a very simple task

**00:05:56** that might be a one-off that will go in here.

**00:05:59** Like for example, I had to disable the automation

**00:06:03** of our Roomba for a few days

**00:06:06** because we were having like a treatment to the floor.

**00:06:08** And so I disabled it.

**00:06:09** And then I've put it back in there to enable it

**00:06:11** in like a week's time.

**00:06:13** And so that kind of thing,

**00:06:14** it's just like a very simple thing.

**00:06:16** I wanna make sure I remember to do it on that exact day

**00:06:19** so I can have it actually go out and do the cleaning.

**00:06:21** So that's the kind of thing I'll just throw it into do

**00:06:23** and it will remind me every 10 minutes

**00:06:25** until I've done it on the day that I've asked for.

**00:06:28** And one of the things about these due tasks

**00:06:31** is that because they are frequent things,

**00:06:33** often I just do them because I remember.

**00:06:36** So having them as a little widget,

**00:06:38** they're just there and I can very quickly check them off

**00:06:41** from the interactive widget.

**00:06:42** And I don't need to open that app due to them.

**00:06:45** Right.

**00:06:45** So to me, this felt like a really good thing

**00:06:49** to just have there on my home screen all the time.

**00:06:51** They're not work tasks.

**00:06:53** So I don't feel like the impending not having done work.

**00:06:57** And it's very easy for me to just check these off

**00:06:59** and get them done.

**00:07:00** And so I like this widget a lot actually.

**00:07:02** Hmm.

**00:07:03** I feel like I've underappreciated the role

**00:07:05** that do used to play in my life.

**00:07:08** And I might borrow this from you.

**00:07:10** I think do deserves a second view.

**00:07:13** I need to take a look at that again.

**00:07:14** The other little square widget is Time-ary.

**00:07:17** And now the iOS 17 shortcuts widget underneath

**00:07:21** has two actions rather than one action, which is awesome.

**00:07:25** And underneath that little Time-ary widget

**00:07:28** is like the stack and I've got two Time-ary related shortcuts.

**00:07:32** One is a shortcut I have where I can just add an increment

**00:07:37** of time to my time tracker.

**00:07:39** So I can tap it and be like, I just

**00:07:41** did 15 minutes of this kind of work,

**00:07:43** but I forgot to press the button.

**00:07:45** So I like that.

**00:07:46** Oh, huh.

**00:07:47** OK, I didn't realize that was a feature.

**00:07:48** That's nice.

**00:07:49** You can build a shortcut like I built the shortcut years ago.

**00:07:51** It just looks at the current time,

**00:07:54** subtracts it by the amount of time that I've asked,

**00:07:57** and then adds it as an entry to Time-ary.

**00:08:00** And then I also have one more, which

**00:08:01** is my recording or editing shows timer, where if I hit it,

**00:08:06** it says you're recording or editing.

**00:08:08** If I hit recording, it looks on my calendar

**00:08:10** and creates a new time entry with that as the tag,

**00:08:13** because I've set the naming up correctly.

**00:08:15** If I'm editing, it just gives me a list of shows to choose from.

**00:08:18** And I'll choose that show and it will start a timer based on that.

**00:08:21** Those are just like my two most often time tracking shortcuts.

**00:08:25** And now they just live on that little stack underneath the Time-ary

**00:08:27** widget, which I'm really happy about.

**00:08:29** And now the Time-ary widget has a nice stop button on it too,

**00:08:32** which is great.

**00:08:32** Oh, you can stop it from that widget.

**00:08:34** OK, great.

**00:08:34** I would stop button.

**00:08:35** A bunch of the widgets have an option in the configuration settings

**00:08:39** to add a stop button to them.

**00:08:42** This was a request that I gave to the developer Joe

**00:08:45** that I felt like the stop button should be available everywhere

**00:08:48** that a timer was incrementing.

**00:08:51** Yeah, that's a good feature.

**00:08:52** Outside of that, there's no other app changes here from year to year.

**00:08:56** And I've ended up with these eight as the ones

**00:08:58** that I'm using most from my home screen.

**00:09:00** So it's Notes, Discord, Google Maps, City Mapper, the Camera,

**00:09:04** and Instagram, Messages, and Slack.

**00:09:06** And then my doc is Todoist, Spark, Safari, and Overcast.

**00:09:10** So that's all remained very similar to previous years.

**00:09:12** Yeah, I think I'm always surprised that Discord is ranked so high

**00:09:16** on your home screen here.

**00:09:17** But I know we have different use cases for that.

**00:09:19** Like every year we do this, I'm like, Discord, really?

**00:09:22** It's work and social for me.

**00:09:24** The fact that I have Slack there says I should have Discord there.

**00:09:27** The fact that I have Instagram says I should have Discord.

**00:09:30** Because it's almost all of those kinds of things.

**00:09:33** It's like a social network in a way, but it's also work.

**00:09:36** And it's also like it's an interesting straddling

**00:09:39** of all of this stuff.

**00:09:40** I've spent a lot of time in Discord now.

**00:09:42** I think the only one I would question is,

**00:09:45** do you really need the camera on this home screen?

**00:09:48** People always say this.

**00:09:49** But I use Camera as both the camera and how I get to my photos.

**00:09:55** OK, so you're using it for the recently taken photos thing,

**00:09:58** where you can open it up and click in the corner?

**00:10:00** Yeah, it's like a double duty.

**00:10:02** Can't you get to the recent photos from your lock screen?

**00:10:04** You can.

**00:10:04** But if I'm using my phone and I want to take a picture,

**00:10:07** well, I lock the phone?

**00:10:08** Yes, that's what I always do.

**00:10:09** Yeah, see, that doesn't make any sense to me.

**00:10:13** Like I'm using my phone.

**00:10:14** Oh, I want to get a picture.

**00:10:15** Press the Glock button.

**00:10:16** Now press the camera button.

**00:10:19** Here we go.

**00:10:20** That's weird.

**00:10:21** Plus as well, when you lock the phone,

**00:10:24** it turns the display off into always on display.

**00:10:26** So you have to tap the phone to wake the phone,

**00:10:29** then press the camera button.

**00:10:30** That is inefficient.

**00:10:31** I guess you're right.

**00:10:32** I was like, this is one of these like when

**00:10:34** you have shortcuts that you just, your fingers know how to do

**00:10:38** and your brain doesn't.

**00:10:38** I was like, Mike, I don't need to tap the screen.

**00:10:40** Oh, I do need to tap the screen in order to wake it up

**00:10:42** and then swipe over.

**00:10:43** I didn't even realize I was doing that.

**00:10:44** It just like tripled my taps, you know?

**00:10:46** Yeah, no, that's true.

**00:10:47** Camera on the lock screen, man.

**00:10:49** Steve Jobs was right.

**00:10:51** But you know what I'm saying?

**00:10:53** He was right the whole time.

**00:10:54** Get it on there.

**00:10:55** OK, all right.

**00:10:55** I'll let you keep the camera.

**00:10:57** I will probably once again next year

**00:10:58** be like, do you really need that camera there, Mike?

**00:11:00** Everyone always says it to me.

**00:11:02** But I think it's a good thing to have.

**00:11:04** And right in the top, I have my long Fantastic

**00:11:17** Motion widgets.

**00:11:18** I'll talk about Notion later.

**00:11:19** I have a bunch of Widgetsmith widgets for photos,

**00:11:23** as well as Apple's photos.

**00:11:25** I have Peek, which is another app I'll talk about later on,

**00:11:28** which shows me some health stuff.

**00:11:30** Then I have the best widget as part of iOS 17, the Home

**00:11:34** widget, which is just like the best thing.

**00:11:38** Are you for real?

**00:11:38** Are you for real suggesting that the Home app is the best widget?

**00:11:41** It's so good.

**00:11:42** Really?

**00:11:43** Let me tell you what makes it good.

**00:11:44** It's like, sell me on the Home widget because I've tried it

**00:11:47** and it only ever just shows me things I never want.

**00:11:50** It doesn't seem like I have any way to tell it which things I use.

**00:11:53** Oh, CGB Grey.

**00:11:55** I'm going to change your life, man.

**00:11:56** You ready?

**00:11:57** Please, please do.

**00:11:58** Long press on the widget.

**00:12:00** Press Edit widget.

**00:12:02** Untick recommended.

**00:12:03** And choose what you want.

**00:12:05** Oh my god.

**00:12:08** This is why State of the Apps exists.

**00:12:11** It's for these nuggets of wisdom.

**00:12:13** You have changed my life.

**00:12:15** That's why I love it.

**00:12:16** So now I have the four lights that I always

**00:12:20** want to be turning off most, the two in the bedroom,

**00:12:22** the two in the lounge.

**00:12:23** I have the TV and the most active scene that I use.

**00:12:26** It's fantastic.

**00:12:28** OK, all right.

**00:12:29** This is definitely going to change some things then.

**00:12:31** It's so good.

**00:12:32** I love it because I hate the way it works in Control Center

**00:12:37** because especially what's complicated for me

**00:12:39** is I have a home at the studio and a home at home.

**00:12:43** And quite often, even though it's

**00:12:46** supposed to change based on location, it doesn't.

**00:12:48** So I'm at home, and I want to turn on the light,

**00:12:51** and I pull it down, and it's showing my my lights

**00:12:52** at the studio.

**00:12:53** This is not helpful to me.

**00:12:54** There's no reason why this should be happening.

**00:12:56** They're not even remotely close to each other.

**00:12:59** But then also just like the phone deciding

**00:13:01** what it wants to show you, I find, I suppose,

**00:13:05** but it's not what I want.

**00:13:06** The only downside with the widget

**00:13:07** is you can only toggle things on and off, right?

**00:13:10** You can't adjust the amount of brightness,

**00:13:14** but I guess you could set up a scene to do that.

**00:13:16** I run everything through scenes.

**00:13:18** My home philosophy is you should basically never

**00:13:21** be controlling an accessory directly.

**00:13:24** Everything should be a part of a scene.

**00:13:26** So I have a ton of scenes, but maybe that's also why I've

**00:13:30** tried that at the home widget and it's like something

**00:13:32** about my brain didn't even process that I could tell it,

**00:13:35** don't recommend.

**00:13:36** And it never occurred to me to untick that box.

**00:13:39** And so I was just disappointed that it was constantly like,

**00:13:42** hey, do you want to hard turn off your Apple TV

**00:13:45** with the smart plug that you put behind it?

**00:13:48** No, how about these scenes that you

**00:13:50** know that I'm telling you to set every day at this time?

**00:13:53** Do you want to suggest me one of them?

**00:13:55** No, no, it never wants to suggest one of them.

**00:13:57** That's funny thing as well for that smart plug

**00:13:59** controlling your Apple TV is your Apple TV

**00:14:01** is probably the dominant home kit hub in your house?

**00:14:07** Yeah, the reason it's extra funny to me

**00:14:08** is because this is a holdover from when I don't know if it

**00:14:11** was TV OS or what, but like when we first got the Apple TV,

**00:14:15** it would just freeze quite a lot.

**00:14:18** And the only way to fix it was to unplug it

**00:14:20** and I plug it back in.

**00:14:22** I got so tired of this.

**00:14:24** I bought a smart plug just so from the couch, right?

**00:14:27** I could press the button to like physically cut

**00:14:30** the power to this Apple TV to then force it to turn back on.

**00:14:33** But if that switch was in home kit, if you turn it off,

**00:14:36** you probably can't turn it back on again via home kit.

**00:14:40** We have home pods though, right?

**00:14:41** Like so the home pods will take the rest of the day.

**00:14:43** Ah, there hubs as well.

**00:14:44** Yeah, there hubs as well.

**00:14:45** We've got like a million things in the house

**00:14:47** that are acting as hubs.

**00:14:48** But my wife and I joked that like buying that smart plug,

**00:14:52** eventually the Apple TV learned.

**00:14:54** We have like a hard threat here, Apple TV.

**00:14:57** You better just freaking work.

**00:14:59** And it slowly was like, okay, I guess I'll be a good Apple TV

**00:15:03** and not just completely freeze on you all the time.

**00:15:05** It's the threatening plug.

**00:15:07** That's why it's extra funny to me

**00:15:08** that home kit was like really aggressive

**00:15:10** about recommending maybe my least used accessory currently

**00:15:14** that like I forgot even existed was always like front

**00:15:17** and center.

**00:15:18** Do you want to hard cut the power to the Apple TV?

**00:15:20** No, no home kit, I don't.

**00:15:22** I then have a Bode, which is my home security system.

**00:15:26** That's a camera widget.

**00:15:27** They also have an interactive widget for setting the state

**00:15:30** of the alarm system, which is pretty cool.

**00:15:32** Then I have one of the new Widget Smith widgets,

**00:15:36** which I love.

**00:15:37** So with the interactive widgets,

**00:15:38** when I tap that photo of the pool,

**00:15:41** it slides up and shows me a countdown to my next vacation.

**00:15:44** Oh, huh.

**00:15:45** Cause you can have these widgets stacked on top

**00:15:48** of each other now.

**00:15:49** So like you can take what were two widget types

**00:15:52** that were in Widget Smith,

**00:15:53** and you can like put them one on top of the other.

**00:15:56** So you can like have a photo hiding time zones.

**00:15:58** I have a photo hiding a countdown and stuff like that.

**00:16:01** This is like one of the things that underscore put in

**00:16:03** is the interactive stuff.

**00:16:05** And I really love that because I like having the countdown,

**00:16:07** but sometimes the image I wanted to use text

**00:16:10** didn't look good on it,

**00:16:12** but now I can have it hidden there.

**00:16:13** And like we did this for like the podcast,

**00:16:15** so I had like an image of the podcast,

**00:16:17** and I would tap it and it would slide up

**00:16:18** and show me the time,

**00:16:19** which is also good for an event like that.

**00:16:22** So I don't see how many days it is all the time.

**00:16:24** Just what I want to see, you know?

**00:16:26** I didn't realize David had put that in Widget Smith,

**00:16:29** but then, I mean, again, as far as I could tell,

**00:16:30** he's built like an entire operating system

**00:16:33** inside of which it's not like the number of things

**00:16:35** he's done is insane.

**00:16:36** So is that like an inspirational photo for you

**00:16:38** for your next vacation, this pool photo?

**00:16:39** Yeah, it's like, here's where you're going.

**00:16:41** Ah, okay.

**00:16:42** You know, and then you tap it and it'll show you.

**00:16:44** It's like, it's nice.

**00:16:45** So that is my regular home screen.

**00:16:49** So when you say your regular home screen,

**00:16:51** does this not exist within a focus mode?

**00:16:53** So this is just like the default state of the phone.

**00:16:56** Yes, I also use these home screens in do not disturb

**00:16:59** and in my recording focus mode.

**00:17:01** Ah, okay.

**00:17:03** I have recording as one of the options in here.

**00:17:05** So you can look at that and look like my recording one

**00:17:08** is exactly the same home screens.

**00:17:10** I just have a different lock screen.

**00:17:12** So the lock screen of like my regular home screen,

**00:17:15** lock screen, that's confusing.

**00:17:17** I just have an image of it, you know,

**00:17:19** and I have the very top lock screen widget is Fantastic Al.

**00:17:23** And then I have weather, I have Widget Smith step counter

**00:17:26** and I have a timer timer, like as the little circle one.

**00:17:29** And then on my recording lock screen,

**00:17:32** I use the photo shuffle thing,

**00:17:35** which is the same as last time.

**00:17:36** And I just have like a Widget Smith time zone thing

**00:17:38** and a larger timer time tracker.

**00:17:41** Am I recording one?

**00:17:42** Okay, huh.

**00:17:43** So it's basically the same there.

**00:17:45** And I don't have anything special for do not disturb.

**00:17:49** Oh, well, it just, it's all the same stuff

**00:17:51** as my regular lock screen.

**00:17:52** Oh, okay.

**00:17:53** So you mean like this is just,

**00:17:54** it looks like this for do not disturb as well.

**00:17:56** Yeah, nothing changes.

**00:17:58** Travel, my travel lock screen,

**00:18:01** which is one of my favorite lock screens.

**00:18:03** I think this is exactly the same as before.

**00:18:06** So I have like the globe lock screen

**00:18:09** because I think that's really cool.

**00:18:09** Show you where you are in the world.

**00:18:11** Oh, I added the batteries lock screen widget,

**00:18:14** which was your recommendation from last time.

**00:18:17** This is funny to me because my travel focus mode,

**00:18:21** literally exactly the same, right?

**00:18:22** It's like clock, weather, battery, flighty,

**00:18:26** and the zoomed in thing for the earth.

**00:18:28** It's a little bit like the correct travel setup

**00:18:32** just manifested itself into the universe.

**00:18:35** Like this is the correct answer for,

**00:18:38** if you need a lock screen while you are traveling,

**00:18:41** this is what you should just do.

**00:18:42** This is the one that looks the best.

**00:18:43** Those are the most obvious options for what to have.

**00:18:46** Well, I think between the two of us,

**00:18:47** we just perfected it.

**00:18:48** You cannot argue with the arrangement.

**00:18:50** It's unarguable.

**00:18:51** Yep.

**00:18:52** And then the home screen itself,

**00:18:53** I use way more widgets here.

**00:18:55** So like I have four widgets and they're just like,

**00:18:58** weather and calendar.

**00:18:59** I have the find my,

**00:19:00** just like a stack of the things that I might have.

**00:19:03** And I can change those around,

**00:19:04** depending on what I'm taking with me,

**00:19:06** like what suitcase I have, what bag I have.

**00:19:08** Ooh.

**00:19:10** I used to have a notes note for both my,

**00:19:13** like a scan of my passport and also my packing list.

**00:19:17** This is now in things, which I'll talk about later.

**00:19:21** So I have a things widget underneath the notes widget,

**00:19:23** which is where my packing list lives.

**00:19:25** And then, you know, for apps,

**00:19:27** they're very similar to my usual apps,

**00:19:29** but I add wallet on there

**00:19:31** because you use a bunch of wallet passes

**00:19:32** when you're in travel and also like airline apps.

**00:19:35** And I changed those out depending on which airline I'm flying.

**00:19:38** Right now, listening to you,

**00:19:40** I'm just, I'm totally stealing the find my widget

**00:19:44** for my own travel setup.

**00:19:45** I didn't think about that one for bags and things,

**00:19:47** or like you can even set it for people.

**00:19:49** Like if you're meeting someone,

**00:19:50** I think like I didn't consider that and that's great.

**00:19:54** I'm going to add that one straight away.

**00:19:56** You know, we spoken about having air tags on the luggage

**00:19:59** and how helpful that can be.

**00:20:01** Yeah, air tags on everything.

**00:20:02** It's super good.

**00:20:03** And then just having them right there,

**00:20:04** it's just like a very quick and easy way

**00:20:06** to get to that thing that I'm going to need.

**00:20:08** And that's what my travel lock screen is really.

**00:20:11** It's like a lot of widgets

**00:20:13** because it will give me information at a glance,

**00:20:15** but also very quickly allows me to get to the apps

**00:20:17** that have the corresponding information

**00:20:19** if I need to dig into them.

**00:20:20** You know, so I've got like, these are all in stacks,

**00:20:22** but I have flighty in there

**00:20:24** and I have Tripsy in there.

**00:20:25** Like, so these are apps that have got that information in them

**00:20:28** and I can just get to them as quickly as possible.

**00:20:30** All right, well, when you're traveling,

**00:20:32** you're traveling to go on vacation.

**00:20:34** Yes.

**00:20:35** Do you have a vacation set up?

**00:20:36** I do now because last year you showed me your vacation

**00:20:39** home screen and lock screen.

**00:20:41** I was like, oh, that's a good idea.

**00:20:42** So I do that.

**00:20:43** And I would say that this builds on the travel one.

**00:20:48** So I still have like a lock screen, which has,

**00:20:51** it now has like an image

**00:20:53** and this will be some kind of like image taken

**00:20:55** whilst on vacation somewhere.

**00:20:56** This is a Perfoe Ovidina taken on a trip

**00:20:58** we took a couple of years ago.

**00:21:00** And I've got weather there, which is very important.

**00:21:02** And I also brought batteries in

**00:21:03** because that's also very important

**00:21:05** when you're on your vacation.

**00:21:07** And then on the home screen, again,

**00:21:08** I have the batteries widget, very helpful.

**00:21:11** I have the Tripsy widget, very helpful.

**00:21:13** So I have Find My there and I have the basic apps

**00:21:16** that I'm gonna need while I'm traveling

**00:21:18** with two spots that are spare

**00:21:21** and that will be apps related to the trip that I'm on.

**00:21:24** Like when I was at WWDC, I still use the vacation one

**00:21:27** and I would add the Apple developer app there

**00:21:29** and the wallet app because I was gonna need those.

**00:21:32** And so depending on the trip that I'm on,

**00:21:34** I will add apps that are relevant

**00:21:36** to this vacation lock screen,

**00:21:38** which I find to be like a very helpful thing to do.

**00:21:41** You know, like if you go into a theme park

**00:21:42** and they have an app and put it on your home screen

**00:21:44** and it's there whenever you need it, you know?

**00:21:46** Yeah, yeah, for any of the kind of like holiday stuff,

**00:21:48** you need that spare space for whatever it is.

**00:21:51** Like I'm a big believer in spare space

**00:21:53** on your home screens or lock screens.

**00:21:56** I've just got to say though, like you're killing me here

**00:21:59** with the wallpaper being the same for all of these modes.

**00:22:04** You change your lock screen wallpaper,

**00:22:06** but you don't want to change the background wallpaper.

**00:22:08** Like I know you love that literal wallpaper

**00:22:10** that is your wallpaper,

**00:22:12** but doesn't that like mess with your brain, right?

**00:22:15** That you're on vacation

**00:22:17** and the wallpaper is still exactly the same?

**00:22:20** Not at all, because the apps are different.

**00:22:22** It grabs your attention, that wallpaper, right?

**00:22:24** It really dominates the scene.

**00:22:27** So I feel like it has such an impact

**00:22:30** that you might want to change it for different,

**00:22:32** but you just don't, I can tell you just don't, okay.

**00:22:35** It's like if you change all the furniture

**00:22:36** inside of your house, you know it's different.

**00:22:39** If you leave the paint or the wallpaper on the walls,

**00:22:40** it's not like, you know?

**00:22:43** I don't approve of this analogy.

**00:22:44** I know you don't.

**00:22:45** I also, as I got halfway through it,

**00:22:47** realized I didn't know how I was going to finish it,

**00:22:49** but the point still stands.

**00:22:52** I changed the lock screens.

**00:22:53** I don't know why I do that.

**00:22:55** I just do that.

**00:22:55** Like it's fun to mess around with them.

**00:22:57** No, you change the lock screens

**00:22:59** because you do it to mentally reinforce

**00:23:02** that you're in a different mode.

**00:23:03** That's why you change lock screens.

**00:23:04** Yeah, but my app layout does that on my home screen.

**00:23:06** I guess I'll just have to believe you,

**00:23:08** but it's like, I can't believe that's like,

**00:23:10** oh my God, you've shown me four focus modes in a row

**00:23:13** and the wallpaper is the same on all four focus modes.

**00:23:16** Oh buddy, you've got another two.

**00:23:17** Don't you worry.

**00:23:18** We're going to go for a perfect 10 here, you know?

**00:23:21** No, we're not, it can't possibly be a perfect 10.

**00:23:23** We'll find out.

**00:23:24** I have a weekend focus mode now.

**00:23:25** This is new, year of the weekend, weekend focus mode.

**00:23:28** Okay, right.

**00:23:29** So it's a different thing that you're focusing on

**00:23:31** related to your theme.

**00:23:32** I'm sure I'm going to click on this

**00:23:33** and I'm going to see a different wallpaper.

**00:23:34** You're going to see the same wallpaper.

**00:23:36** No, God damn it.

**00:23:37** You're going to see the same wallpaper,

**00:23:38** mostly the same apps.

**00:23:40** It's also a photo of Adina in front of that wallpaper.

**00:23:43** That's my average, like that's the regular lock screen.

**00:23:46** This is the regular lock screen.

**00:23:48** Really the main difference here is

**00:23:51** I do actually need to change this.

**00:23:52** I've just looked at this now and realized

**00:23:54** I have not updated this lock screen

**00:23:56** because I still have due there

**00:23:57** and I want to remove that and put the little due

**00:24:00** widget in instead.

**00:24:01** So I need to change that around.

**00:24:02** I'm going to do that today actually.

**00:24:04** It's kind of funny in preparing for this episode,

**00:24:07** I have made multiple changes to multiple lock screens

**00:24:11** and this is one that has not been done.

**00:24:13** So the due app will be gone and I'll put,

**00:24:16** where I've got which is Smith right now,

**00:24:17** I'll put the due widget there as well in a little stack.

**00:24:20** And then on the second screen here,

**00:24:21** it's just a kind of a simplified version

**00:24:23** showing me the home thing,

**00:24:24** my widget saying and also box box,

**00:24:26** which is a Formula One app.

**00:24:29** So it has the times of the next races,

**00:24:30** which always happened on the weekends.

**00:24:32** So I want to know and then also the Sonos app.

**00:24:34** Is that a little picture of the racetrack?

**00:24:36** Is that what that is?

**00:24:37** That's a visual layout of the racetrack.

**00:24:40** It's cool, right?

**00:24:41** Very Mario Kart.

**00:24:43** This app is really nice.

**00:24:44** Like I like it.

**00:24:45** It also has a live activity in there, which I enjoy.

**00:24:47** So like there's a live activity for the race.

**00:24:51** If you are not watching or whatever,

**00:24:54** you can enable live activity and see who's winning.

**00:24:56** I'm only laughing because like,

**00:24:57** oh, someone I know who actually uses the pitched use case

**00:25:01** of live activities, which was like,

**00:25:03** you can follow the sports game.

**00:25:04** Because I'm just so not into sports.

**00:25:06** My brain filed that away as like,

**00:25:08** ah yes, what a lovely developer example

**00:25:11** of like how to make a test case.

**00:25:12** It's like, no, no, people actually do that, right?

**00:25:14** This is very important to them.

**00:25:15** So one of those people.

**00:25:16** Nice sports.

**00:25:18** Okay, so when you're going to sleep,

**00:25:20** sleep's got to look different.

**00:25:21** Nope.

**00:25:22** It does.

**00:25:23** It's different widgets.

**00:25:24** It's not different.

**00:25:26** So everything's different.

**00:25:28** I only have one page for my sleep home screens.

**00:25:32** And basically what we're seeing here is YouTube

**00:25:35** and Audible are being added.

**00:25:36** So YouTube, I watch videos at night to wind down,

**00:25:39** same as audio books at night to wind down.

**00:25:42** And then I also have a little home,

**00:25:43** little square home one.

**00:25:44** And these are the lights I need at night, right?

**00:25:46** Make sure the lounge lights are off downstairs

**00:25:48** and maybe the bedroom lights are on

**00:25:50** while we're getting ready for sleep

**00:25:52** and then turn them off.

**00:25:52** And it's just like an easy way to get that done.

**00:25:54** Do you really find that YouTube winds you down at night?

**00:25:56** That feels like a bad choice for,

**00:25:58** I'm going to go to bed.

**00:25:59** So I'm going to watch some YouTube videos.

**00:26:01** Like, yeah.

**00:26:02** That works for you?

**00:26:03** I mean, it's not all like,

**00:26:05** hey guys, you know, it's not all, you know,

**00:26:08** sometimes it's like, oh, watch me make these knives.

**00:26:11** If that works, I just feel like the related videos

**00:26:13** are always there trying to just like keep you focused

**00:26:15** on the app forever as opposed to something like Audible.

**00:26:18** Great.

**00:26:19** You're talking to somebody

**00:26:20** who doesn't pay attention to related videos.

**00:26:22** Oh, okay.

**00:26:23** I'm very good with YouTube.

**00:26:24** Like I don't watch things that are on the front page.

**00:26:27** I just watched stuff from my watch later queue.

**00:26:29** That's my world subscriptions.

**00:26:32** And then I only watch things from the watch later queue.

**00:26:34** So it's very easy for me to ignore most of what YouTube

**00:26:38** is trying to give me.

**00:26:40** It's like, good try YouTube.

**00:26:43** Do you want to watch shorts?

**00:26:44** We've got shorts for you, please.

**00:26:45** None of that stuff finds its way to me.

**00:26:46** Please watch the shorts.

**00:26:47** Okay, good.

**00:26:49** I still feel like, I don't know, for a sleep focus,

**00:26:52** you might want to have a, like a dimmer wallpaper,

**00:26:55** you know, something that's just a bit more,

**00:26:57** okay, can I negotiate with you here?

**00:26:59** Would you consider taking your current wallpaper,

**00:27:03** which you obviously love, but just like.

**00:27:06** Why?

**00:27:08** I haven't even said it.

**00:27:10** I'm not interested in what you're telling me.

**00:27:11** I was just gonna say like, put a little vignette on it.

**00:27:14** Why?

**00:27:14** Just pull the saturation down or,

**00:27:17** so it feels more like bedtime.

**00:27:18** That's why.

**00:27:19** I don't need it.

**00:27:20** Oh God.

**00:27:21** I don't know why this really bothers me.

**00:27:22** I don't know why it bothers you either.

**00:27:24** It's fine.

**00:27:25** Like, it's not a problem.

**00:27:28** Okay.

**00:27:29** I also have some watch faces for you.

**00:27:31** I'm glad you can't put wallpaper on watch faces.

**00:27:33** All right, let's take a look at your watch faces.

**00:27:34** I'm unhappy.

**00:27:36** Oh yeah, really?

**00:27:38** I think like you and everyone else on earth.

**00:27:40** Because I have a new watch now, right?

**00:27:41** I have the Apple Watch Ultra.

**00:27:43** And the watches faces I've used before

**00:27:45** don't look good on the Apple Watch Ultra.

**00:27:46** I used to like a lot of the round watch faces.

**00:27:49** The round watch faces do not translate very well

**00:27:51** to the Apple Watch Ultra.

**00:27:53** So I've decided that the best thing for me to do

**00:27:55** is just do what the Apple Watch Ultra wants me to do.

**00:27:57** And I use the modular ultra watch face.

**00:28:01** And what I will say is,

**00:28:02** while I do not like the look of this watch face,

**00:28:04** it is very utilitarian.

**00:28:08** It is helpful.

**00:28:09** Because I have like a billion complications

**00:28:12** on this watch face, right?

**00:28:14** So I have top left, carrot, then dew,

**00:28:17** then a fantastic cow showing me the date.

**00:28:19** Then I have the big fantastic cow in the middle

**00:28:21** showing me my next appointment.

**00:28:22** Then I can see my activity rings.

**00:28:24** I can get to my medications app and timer.

**00:28:26** Like ton of information, which is good.

**00:28:28** And I can access the things that I'm doing

**00:28:30** most often right there.

**00:28:32** But I just don't like the way it looks.

**00:28:34** But this watch is so huge,

**00:28:37** I figure I've just got to lean into it.

**00:28:38** I can't try and fancy it up anymore.

**00:28:40** This is just what it is.

**00:28:42** Let's rewind back in time.

**00:28:44** The Apple Watch has just been released

**00:28:46** and someone shows you and they go,

**00:28:49** someday here will be all of the watch faces

**00:28:53** that you can use.

**00:28:54** And then I was able to see the current slate of watch faces.

**00:28:58** I go, wow, I can't believe how many they're going to have

**00:29:02** by next year.

**00:29:04** And then the time traveler would say,

**00:29:06** oh, no, no, this is going to be 10 fucking years later.

**00:29:12** We've mentioned it a million times,

**00:29:14** but it is just mind blowing to me still how limited

**00:29:18** and locked in time these Apple watch faces are.

**00:29:23** What you've just said is the truth of like trying

**00:29:26** to make it look good is this endless battle.

**00:29:30** And it always feels like they find a way

**00:29:34** to force you to decide between two different things.

**00:29:38** And it's like, but no, I would like this watch face

**00:29:40** to do these two things and it would look much better.

**00:29:42** So it was like, no, no, no, no, no.

**00:29:44** Like you can have this part be colored,

**00:29:46** but not that part be colored or like whatever it is.

**00:29:49** It's just incredibly frustrating.

**00:29:51** This new Apple Watch Ultra face.

**00:29:53** Yep, okay, we've got a new one, but it's still the same.

**00:29:57** It's still the same as all of them.

**00:29:59** And yeah, it's just very frustrating.

**00:30:02** What I do like about this new one compared

**00:30:03** to some of the other ones is like it has that ring

**00:30:06** around the outside and there's a few things

**00:30:07** you can do with it.

**00:30:09** And I have it set to ticking seconds,

**00:30:11** which I do find to be helpful.

**00:30:12** Yeah, you know, a decade in the future,

**00:30:16** but we can put a ring on it that shows you the seconds.

**00:30:19** Thanks guys.

**00:30:20** I also have a travel watch face.

**00:30:22** These are the only two watch faces I have.

**00:30:24** Only two, interesting.

**00:30:25** What else is, this is the first time I've ever set

**00:30:27** another watch face.

**00:30:28** So maybe I'll do more in the future

**00:30:30** because before I really was just trying

**00:30:32** to make it look the best it could be

**00:30:33** when now I'm trying to lean into the utility.

**00:30:36** But this is my like traveling watch face.

**00:30:39** And I'll probably set one up for maybe for vacations too,

**00:30:43** but it's the first one I've done.

**00:30:45** And the reason I did it was because

**00:30:46** there was a flighty watch app now.

**00:30:49** And that's what the middle complication is,

**00:30:51** but it's blacked out.

**00:30:52** But that's the, I put the flighty one there.

**00:30:55** So that shows me my next flight information.

**00:30:58** Then I also have removed due and added a quick access

**00:31:01** to my find items, right?

**00:31:03** So like I can find my air tags.

**00:31:06** And then in the bottom right, instead of timery,

**00:31:08** I have time zone in London, like the time in London,

**00:31:12** or I might set it to where I'm going to, for example,

**00:31:14** to have arrived there.

**00:31:15** So that is my travel watch face.

**00:33:33** A thanks to Memberful for the support

**00:33:35** of this show and RelayFM.

**00:33:38** All right, so the number one rule that everyone would know

**00:33:42** is if you're going to have different focus modes

**00:33:46** and different setups for doing different kinds

**00:33:49** of things in life,

**00:33:51** you want them to look different.

**00:33:52** You want them to be visually,

**00:33:55** immediately, obviously different.

**00:33:58** Interesting.

**00:33:59** You can do that with app arrangement is one tool,

**00:34:02** but it's not a sufficient tool.

**00:34:04** You want to also try to use color

**00:34:06** and you want to try to use imagery

**00:34:09** so that it's just immediately obvious

**00:34:12** that you are in a different mode.

**00:34:14** Communicate that instantly.

**00:34:16** So I've pulled out the main focus modes.

**00:34:23** I've sent you a copy of all the different things

**00:34:26** that I have.

**00:34:27** So on a high level,

**00:34:28** I have a lot of the similar modes that you do.

**00:34:31** So I've got like weekend, I've got travel,

**00:34:33** I've got sleep, the do not disturb mode.

**00:34:36** And then I've got a mode for health,

**00:34:39** a mode that I call core for what I think of as core work,

**00:34:43** like the most important stuff that usually means writing.

**00:34:47** And then I have a mode called open,

**00:34:49** which is basically like my default mode for the phone.

**00:34:52** Now, bunch of modes, how do you distinguish them?

**00:34:55** Well, Apple this year added these absolutely lovely

**00:35:00** planetary image backgrounds.

**00:35:02** And so I've decided to go through all of my focus modes

**00:35:06** and pick one of the planets with a slight exception

**00:35:10** to represent each of these modes.

**00:35:12** Oh, a planet?

**00:35:14** How on earth can you discern between the different shapes?

**00:35:17** Because the planets look different.

**00:35:18** If it's all the same shape and a black background,

**00:35:21** surely these planets don't look that different.

**00:35:23** I've never bumped into a square planet before, have you?

**00:35:26** No, I have not bumped into a square planet before.

**00:35:29** But I will say, if you decide to go with this mode,

**00:35:33** you will realize we don't actually have a lot

**00:35:35** of different colors for the different planets.

**00:35:38** There's obviously the standout of Saturn, right?

**00:35:40** Which has the rings that makes it more visually different.

**00:35:42** Earth looks quite different.

**00:35:44** But then if you're like, oh, right,

**00:35:46** Neptune and Uranus look basically like the exact same planet.

**00:35:50** Mercury and the moon are quite difficult

**00:35:52** to tell the difference at a glance.

**00:35:54** So I've eliminated the similar ones.

**00:35:58** But it did make me feel like, ah, we

**00:36:01** could use more colors in these planets, right?

**00:36:03** We could use more differentiation for different ones.

**00:36:05** Why do they all have to be planets?

**00:36:07** Why can't you just use completely different images?

**00:36:09** Or things that all relate to the thing that it is?

**00:36:13** Here's the problem, Mike.

**00:36:15** If you're trying to pick, like in my case here,

**00:36:18** six, seven different wallpapers to represent

**00:36:22** these different modes, I would want them to be distinct,

**00:36:28** but also related.

**00:36:31** And that's actually quite a difficult task

**00:36:33** to find wallpapers that go together nicely,

**00:36:37** but also are visually distinct in their colors.

**00:36:41** And so this was the kind of task where

**00:36:44** I was driving myself crazy because I would find,

**00:36:47** like, ooh, I've got four good wallpapers that work together.

**00:36:51** But these two just don't quite fit.

**00:36:53** And it's like, well, let me try to fix this problem

**00:36:56** by finding a new set of six wallpapers

**00:36:58** that can work perfectly well.

**00:37:00** And so when Apple came out with those planets,

**00:37:03** I made the decision for my own mental sanity.

**00:37:05** I was like, you know what?

**00:37:07** I'm just going to work with what Apple gave me.

**00:37:09** There's enough choices here.

**00:37:10** So I'm just going to stick with the planets for each

**00:37:13** of the different focus modes.

**00:37:14** And I think it looks really nice.

**00:37:16** And there's enough of them that are enough different

**00:37:18** with the colors that it can be just immediately obvious,

**00:37:22** which thing are you doing?

**00:37:23** Sure.

**00:37:24** So yes, this is what I do.

**00:37:26** For me, as you can see, many of these focus modes

**00:37:30** are quite bare.

**00:37:32** So like if we take a look at do not disturb,

**00:37:35** which I've used as the moon, leave me alone, right?

**00:37:39** Nobody come here.

**00:37:40** I just don't have anything on my phone

**00:37:43** for the do not disturb mode,

**00:37:44** because the only circumstances in which I use that

**00:37:48** are circumstances basically

**00:37:49** which I shouldn't be using my phone anyway.

**00:37:53** So like we're recording the podcast right now,

**00:37:55** but the phone and do not disturb mode.

**00:37:57** I'm not going to do anything with the phone

**00:37:59** because we're recording a show.

**00:38:00** I don't need anything here.

**00:38:02** So I'm just going to not have anything on the screen at all.

**00:38:05** And I really like having it like that.

**00:38:08** I mean, it's good to know when you're doing it disturb,

**00:38:09** when the sun's going to go down.

**00:38:11** It's good to have a lock screen,

**00:38:12** cut out the old sun down there.

**00:38:15** Why are you making fun of me for that?

**00:38:17** Because you started it.

**00:38:19** We were perfectly cordial.

**00:38:21** And then you're like, oh, look at your wallpaper.

**00:38:24** So I assume the dock here, we have three shortcuts,

**00:38:28** I'm assuming.

**00:38:29** Oh, yes, right.

**00:38:30** Okay, yes.

**00:38:31** The only thing that I can do in any of these modes

**00:38:33** that have nothing on them is yes,

**00:38:35** the dock, I've got three shortcuts.

**00:38:37** Years ago, I used to have a launcher down here,

**00:38:39** which brought up like a list of a bunch of different things

**00:38:41** that I could use.

**00:38:42** And I decided, you know what,

**00:38:44** I can easily 80, 20 or 90, 10,

**00:38:47** which of these am I actually using basically all of the time

**00:38:50** and just search for the rest and get rid of this launcher.

**00:38:53** So I've gone down now to three things.

**00:38:56** They're all input shortcuts.

**00:38:58** So one is for OmniFocus, one is for a new note,

**00:39:02** and one is for Cortex,

**00:39:03** for something to talk about on the show.

**00:39:05** So those are the three that I leave on the bottom

**00:39:07** is just like input.

**00:39:08** I have a thought, it needs to go somewhere.

**00:39:11** Basically all of the time,

**00:39:14** it's going into one of these three things.

**00:39:17** I mean, there's a little problem that we'll get to later,

**00:39:19** which is like stuff should also be going into Obsidian,

**00:39:23** but we can get to that at a later point.

**00:39:25** This is like most of my use case

**00:39:27** for just about absolutely everything.

**00:39:29** So those are my items in the dock.

**00:39:31** So I guess later on, we'll find out

**00:39:32** where they're actually going.

**00:39:34** Cause that didn't sound too good.

**00:39:36** I also like that you've had what I kind of consider

**00:39:39** as like the very typical shortcuts experience,

**00:39:41** which is like, I'll start one shortcut.

**00:39:44** Now I'll make a shortcuts menu.

**00:39:47** Yeah.

**00:39:47** 20 shortcuts.

**00:39:48** And then I'll realize I don't use them all.

**00:39:50** And so I'm just going to go back to the ones

**00:39:52** that I really need,

**00:39:53** rather than like my multi shortcut, the Omni shortcut,

**00:39:57** every shortcut possible, you know?

**00:40:00** And people end up like pairing that back over time.

**00:40:03** This is the exact same experience that people have

**00:40:06** when they get into time tracking, right?

**00:40:07** Is the like, oh, I'll just track work.

**00:40:11** And it's like, oh, I'll just see how many work hours I do.

**00:40:13** And then it grows into like incredibly fine distinctions

**00:40:17** for absolutely everything.

**00:40:18** And then you get paired back to like, no, wait a minute.

**00:40:20** It's really only four things I care about.

**00:40:23** I don't care about everything in my life.

**00:40:25** I don't need to time track

**00:40:26** these really subtle differences.

**00:40:28** So yeah.

**00:40:29** Hang on.

**00:40:30** Don't you track everything?

**00:40:32** I'm always running a tracker,

**00:40:33** but there's a distinction here of like

**00:40:35** how fine grained are the differences between the trackers.

**00:40:39** And I just see this with everybody.

**00:40:41** And I also went through with time tracking

**00:40:43** is like you wildly expand to like,

**00:40:45** I'm going to time track the individual books

**00:40:48** that I'm reading.

**00:40:49** And it's like, really?

**00:40:50** You don't need to do that.

**00:40:51** That doesn't make any sense.

**00:40:53** And people then pair it back and go like,

**00:40:55** just reading is fine, right?

**00:40:57** Yeah.

**00:40:58** It's the same thing with shortcuts.

**00:40:59** Like you said, you sort of explode into a billion number

**00:41:00** of shortcuts and then you go,

**00:41:02** yeah, but 90% of the time I'm using these three

**00:41:06** and that's fine.

**00:41:07** And then you also have a corresponding empty watch face.

**00:41:11** What do we call this watch face empty?

**00:41:12** We have the weather on it.

**00:41:13** Well, I'm assuming that the other ones

**00:41:14** maybe have more complications on them.

**00:41:16** Well, I just wanted something that was non-distracting.

**00:41:19** I feel like I've just gone with a, you know,

**00:41:21** no numbers watch face, just the weather,

**00:41:24** basically black and white, matching the moon.

**00:41:26** It's actually a slight subtle gray there.

**00:41:28** Naturally.

**00:41:29** But yes, once again, trying to pair watch faces with modes

**00:41:34** is exercise in disappointment.

**00:41:37** This is probably one of the better ones

**00:41:39** and we're going to get to like sad, ugly ones later.

**00:41:41** Oh, I look forward to it.

**00:41:43** So where next on the tour?

**00:41:45** Which planet are we going to now?

**00:41:47** If we're on the moon, then I guess we'll go to earth next.

**00:41:51** Slightly disappointing because I could see

**00:41:52** that I have travel set up exactly the same way

**00:41:55** that you have travel set up.

**00:41:57** So that's completely uninteresting.

**00:41:58** But I do cheat and I use earth twice,

**00:42:02** which I'm just like a little bit upset

**00:42:04** at having to use the same planet twice.

**00:42:06** But Apple does provide this thing

**00:42:08** where you have two options,

**00:42:09** like the zoomed in earth and the zoomed out earth.

**00:42:13** Yeah, because the zoomed in one is good for travel

**00:42:15** because it is showing you where you are.

**00:42:16** I think that's kind of cool.

**00:42:17** Yeah, so the zoomed out earth

**00:42:19** is what I use for my open mode.

**00:42:22** And this is basically like the default mode on the phone,

**00:42:28** almost all of the time.

**00:42:29** Basically the way my day works is like,

**00:42:31** I start out in the core for like doing my actual work

**00:42:36** or it's the weekend.

**00:42:37** And then in the afternoon, this rolls over into open mode.

**00:42:42** And I call it open and I use the earth

**00:42:44** because this is the period of time

**00:42:46** in which notifications will actually reach me.

**00:42:49** This is when you will communicate with people on earth.

**00:42:52** That's exactly why I chose the earth.

**00:42:54** Well, I like it.

**00:42:55** Because then in the other ones,

**00:42:56** look, if you are from Mars, I'll speak to you.

**00:42:58** If you're not, I wanna know.

**00:43:00** I get it.

**00:43:01** So yeah, so the open mode is the only time

**00:43:03** I'm having anything to do with other earthlings,

**00:43:07** hence the earth mode.

**00:43:08** And I guess it also works for travel too, right?

**00:43:10** It's like, I'm having to like get through

**00:43:11** all of these other earthlings around me

**00:43:13** to like get wherever I'm going.

**00:43:15** So this is the time where notifications can come through,

**00:43:19** apps could have like badges and things.

**00:43:22** This is the one, that's the afternoon one.

**00:43:24** I don't have anything wildly interesting here.

**00:43:27** Again, I like to try to keep things relatively simple.

**00:43:30** So.

**00:43:30** Yeah, I would like to ask on the lock screen,

**00:43:32** what is the complication with the little flame?

**00:43:35** Okay, yeah, so on the lock screen,

**00:43:36** I've got batteries, activity, the weather.

**00:43:39** The flame one is zero, which is that fasting application

**00:43:43** that I've mentioned in previous years.

**00:43:45** So it's a little timer and it just shows a little icon

**00:43:49** which tells you like which phase of the fast are you in.

**00:43:53** So that's just something that I have.

**00:43:54** What does a flame have to do with it?

**00:43:56** Are you burning calories now?

**00:43:58** Is that what's going on?

**00:43:59** That's basically what they mean is like, yeah,

**00:44:01** you're in the fat burning zone of your fast.

**00:44:05** That's basically what it means.

**00:44:07** If I was doing that and I was hungry,

**00:44:09** I would not appreciate that little countdown.

**00:44:11** Yeah, I mean, this is like a whole other thing,

**00:44:13** but yeah, I've just been sort of keeping track of this.

**00:44:16** This is part of my, people know like

**00:44:18** I've always skipped breakfast for forever.

**00:44:20** I guess this falls in the same category of,

**00:44:23** I'm always running a time tracker.

**00:44:25** And so this little timer of like,

**00:44:28** when are you done eating for the evening

**00:44:31** to just start it like slipped right into my routine

**00:44:34** super easily.

**00:44:36** This to me is actually the primary benefit

**00:44:38** because I feel like the danger is always evening time,

**00:44:41** but like you're snacking for the whole evening.

**00:44:44** So this is also more about like,

**00:44:46** it's not really so much for me about

**00:44:47** when the timer runs down, like I don't care

**00:44:50** and I will blow past this at all times, right?

**00:44:52** It's like, oh, you've got two hours left

**00:44:55** to hit your whatever goal.

**00:44:56** It's like, I don't care, right?

**00:44:58** I don't care a timer.

**00:44:59** It's much more about making a little decision of like,

**00:45:02** okay, it's 8 p.m.

**00:45:05** I'm like done eating for the day.

**00:45:07** And I know that because I pressed the button

**00:45:08** to start the little fasting timer.

**00:45:10** So that's what that thing is.

**00:45:12** And then on the home screen itself,

**00:45:14** I just have the weather

**00:45:16** and I have an OmniFocus widget,

**00:45:19** which is showing me a list that I call now,

**00:45:23** which is basically most of the things

**00:45:26** that are available to me,

**00:45:27** just sorted in the kind of project slash priority order.

**00:45:32** You got a lot left to do today.

**00:45:34** Yeah. 23 tasks.

**00:45:37** That's like three days for me.

**00:45:39** That's rough stuff.

**00:45:41** Good luck.

**00:45:41** It's why I was intrigued by the do thing

**00:45:44** that you were mentioning before

**00:45:45** is because I think I should experiment

**00:45:48** with pulling out some of the more smaller personal tasks

**00:45:53** that might fit into this category of like,

**00:45:57** it needs to be done today.

**00:45:58** It doesn't really make sense in a major project

**00:46:01** and it helps to be nagged.

**00:46:04** So like I have a ridiculous number of things

**00:46:07** in my OmniFocus.

**00:46:08** And so it always looks like,

**00:46:10** oh, Gray has like a crazy number of things,

**00:46:13** but I rarely ever think that like,

**00:46:16** oh, I'm gonna get to the end of this list today.

**00:46:18** That's just not how I use the system.

**00:46:20** And it's more like they're ranked in priority

**00:46:23** and you just like work your way down the list

**00:46:26** and a bunch of like huge numbers of very small things

**00:46:29** like take out the trash, right?

**00:46:32** Take your vitamins or whatever,

**00:46:33** like a bunch of things like that are in there as well.

**00:46:35** So it's just a different use for a task manager.

**00:46:38** Yeah, okay.

**00:46:40** So I guess we're gonna go to Mars next,

**00:46:44** which is obviously Mars is for sleep.

**00:46:49** Why wouldn't the moon be for sleep?

**00:46:50** I don't know.

**00:46:51** Why?

**00:46:52** Okay, so I'm glad you asked, Mike.

**00:46:53** Why isn't the moon for sleep?

**00:46:54** Because it does seem like the moon should be for sleep.

**00:46:57** Yeah.

**00:46:58** But it's not for sleep because in the actual real world,

**00:47:02** when you're using your phone,

**00:47:04** the moon's color is basically bright white,

**00:47:08** like in the evening time, right?

**00:47:10** It's the end of the day or like you're getting ready for bed

**00:47:12** and you look at your phone and there's like a circle

**00:47:15** of a flashlight just shining into your eyes

**00:47:18** that is your phone drawing the moon.

**00:47:20** So I basically chose Mars because it is the reddest planet.

**00:47:25** It is the darkest, sleepiest color

**00:47:28** of all of the planets to choose from.

**00:47:30** So that is why Mars is the sleep focus.

**00:47:33** Okay, because it's the sleep focus,

**00:47:34** you don't have the image of Mars on the lock screen,

**00:47:36** just on the home screen.

**00:47:37** It is very faintly on the lock screen.

**00:47:40** Really?

**00:47:41** But it is.

**00:47:42** Oh yeah, I can kinda see that.

**00:47:43** Right, it's barely there.

**00:47:44** Because you have like the always on,

**00:47:46** it's like doing the sleep thing

**00:47:47** and the always on, I get that.

**00:47:48** It really, really dims the wallpaper in sleep mode.

**00:47:52** Yeah, so you could easily miss it,

**00:47:53** but you won't miss it if you're actually

**00:47:54** in like a completely black room,

**00:47:56** then you're like, oh, you can't actually see

**00:47:57** that it's there.

**00:47:58** But yeah, the sleep mode, I have that setting

**00:47:59** where it dims the wallpaper, which, so here's the thing.

**00:48:03** I do like that for the wallpaper,

**00:48:05** for dimming the wallpaper, but okay,

**00:48:07** Apple Watch frustrations.

**00:48:09** I have an Apple Watch face for sleep mode.

**00:48:13** So this is the same face that you were talking about,

**00:48:16** like the modular Ultra face.

**00:48:18** Is it?

**00:48:20** It is.

**00:48:21** So I actually really like this watch face.

**00:48:24** I think this is super classy.

**00:48:26** You get like big tall numbers in the middle.

**00:48:29** You can turn off basically all of the complications,

**00:48:33** but this is the Ultra face.

**00:48:36** And I feel like if you remove basically everything

**00:48:40** and expand the numbers in the middle,

**00:48:43** I kind of think it's one of the nicest watch faces

**00:48:46** that Apple makes, but this is what I was talking

**00:48:49** about before with Apple forces you to make decisions

**00:48:54** that are very frustrating.

**00:48:56** So I use this face for sleep because it has an option

**00:49:00** which says, oh, do you want this watch face

**00:49:01** to go into sleep mode?

**00:49:03** You can make it red.

**00:49:05** So instead of having the time being white numbers,

**00:49:08** you can make them red numbers.

**00:49:10** I love it.

**00:49:11** When I found that, I was like, oh, cool.

**00:49:13** I can't wait to use this watch face.

**00:49:14** And I'll just set different colors for all

**00:49:17** of the different focus modes that I use.

**00:49:19** No, you can have it white or you can have it red.

**00:49:23** Those are your only two choices.

**00:49:25** Like God damn it, Apple.

**00:49:27** Like let me make it like this, but yellow.

**00:49:31** No, you can't do that, right?

**00:49:33** Because you can change the color,

**00:49:35** but it changes the color of everything except the numbers

**00:49:38** which are always white.

**00:49:39** Everything is accepted to the numbers.

**00:49:42** So frustrating.

**00:49:44** Like this again is the thing of like,

**00:49:45** it's the most obvious thing that people might want to change

**00:49:50** and they always gets you, right?

**00:49:52** It's the same thing with like the watch hands.

**00:49:54** Like, oh, we can change everything except the watch hands.

**00:49:57** No, you can't change the watch.

**00:49:59** It's so frustrating.

**00:50:01** And so like, I really like this

**00:50:04** as a super simple digital watch face,

**00:50:06** but I just, I use it on one other thing,

**00:50:10** but I would use it everywhere

**00:50:11** if I could just change the color of the actual numbers.

**00:50:14** It was like, no, red or white, that's it.

**00:50:17** Very weird.

**00:50:18** Yeah, this watch on your wrist

**00:50:20** that has more computing power

**00:50:21** than has sent actual people to the moon

**00:50:24** cannot draw these numerals in a different color.

**00:50:27** It's like, oh, so frustrating.

**00:50:30** What next take me to another planet, Gray?

**00:50:32** So my very easy method just so Jupiter,

**00:50:35** let's go to health.

**00:50:36** Why?

**00:50:37** I guess I'm realizing in this conversation with you,

**00:50:39** I feel like I have strong feelings about the planets

**00:50:43** that you just don't.

**00:50:45** No, of course I don't.

**00:50:47** Why would I associate Jupiter in health?

**00:50:49** Why would I do that?

**00:50:50** Jupiter is like the biggest and burliest

**00:50:52** of all the planets, right?

**00:50:53** It's like, if any planet lifts,

**00:50:55** Jupiter totally lifts, bro.

**00:50:57** Like it obviously does.

**00:50:58** But maybe like Jupiter is just for show, you know?

**00:51:01** The level planet is actually stronger,

**00:51:03** but Jupiter just like bulks up.

**00:51:05** I was actually just mentally flipping

**00:51:07** through the roster of planets.

**00:51:08** I'm like, who could that be?

**00:51:10** And like, no, I don't think anybody else does.

**00:51:12** What about Saturn?

**00:51:12** Saturn's like holding the rings up.

**00:51:14** Saturn is the planet that's like for looks, right?

**00:51:16** It's got the flashy rings.

**00:51:17** Fair enough.

**00:51:19** Okay, so for the Jupiter one,

**00:51:21** this is where things are actually kind of useful.

**00:51:24** Jupiter's the coolest looking planet, right?

**00:51:27** With the frigging storm going on.

**00:51:29** You're like, what are you doing, man?

**00:51:30** The storm is very interesting.

**00:51:31** It's super cool.

**00:51:32** It's like, oh, it's always there.

**00:51:34** It's like, oh, wow, okay.

**00:51:36** So because Jupiter obviously lifts on the home screen,

**00:51:40** this is where I have all of the apps related to health.

**00:51:43** So particularly when I'm doing an exercise,

**00:51:47** it triggers to flip into the health mode.

**00:51:49** So this is also like what you would have for fitness, right?

**00:51:54** Yeah, I originally called this fitness,

**00:51:57** but I ran into a problem

**00:51:58** where Apple has fitness hard coded as a mode.

**00:52:03** And I cannot remember what it is now,

**00:52:05** but that caused some problem for me with some automation.

**00:52:09** The fact that it was like hard coded just didn't work.

**00:52:12** I cannot remember what it was now,

**00:52:13** but I had to change it to a more generic name.

**00:52:15** Yeah, I have a fitness focus mode,

**00:52:18** but all it does is just turns off my notifications,

**00:52:21** basically.

**00:52:22** Right, right.

**00:52:23** Although it stopped working with the new watch.

**00:52:25** I don't understand why,

**00:52:26** but that's the thing I need to work out for another time.

**00:52:29** But yeah, I don't have anything special for it.

**00:52:31** It's purely just like,

**00:52:32** I just don't want any notifications

**00:52:34** when I'm working out of any kind.

**00:52:36** And I just leave it at that.

**00:52:37** Yeah, so it's the same thing here.

**00:52:39** Like I feel like you, I just don't want any note.

**00:52:41** Whatever it is, it can wait until after.

**00:52:45** It will wait 45 minutes, right?

**00:52:46** Like it just will.

**00:52:47** And I just don't want the distractions.

**00:52:49** Yeah, completely agree.

**00:52:51** So I've got Fitbot on here,

**00:52:52** which is my exercise app that I mentioned before.

**00:52:55** Just totally love life changing sponsor

**00:52:58** of this episode, I believe.

**00:53:00** Hugely important life changing app for me.

**00:53:02** I also have the regular Apple Fitness one,

**00:53:05** and I have the Apple Health app on here.

**00:53:08** The Health app is ruining the aesthetic of this on screen.

**00:53:11** God damn it, Mike, you're right.

**00:53:14** Everything is fitting.

**00:53:15** Even the fitness app,

**00:53:16** because it's got like the good hue

**00:53:18** that fits with the other colors.

**00:53:19** And in Health, it's just like,

**00:53:21** yo, I'm here too, you know?

**00:53:24** You know what, you're totally right.

**00:53:25** Okay, so I'm just like right now,

**00:53:27** add Omni item, like create shortcuts,

**00:53:30** because it's gonna bother me.

**00:53:32** Create shortcuts for Health app.

**00:53:35** You're totally right.

**00:53:36** I can't unsee it now.

**00:53:39** I feel like maybe if it was black with the heart

**00:53:42** that was pink, that might look kind of nice,

**00:53:44** because then it would like fit with the fitness app

**00:53:45** a little bit, that might be kind of cool.

**00:53:47** Yeah, you're right.

**00:53:48** Okay, so this gets filed under bugs in OmniFocus.

**00:53:50** A lot of calculators.

**00:53:52** Pounds to kilograms, kilograms to pounds.

**00:53:55** Smith plate calculator, I don't know what that means.

**00:53:58** Plate calculator, there's a lot of things going on there.

**00:54:00** Okay, so what's happening here is the weights that I use

**00:54:04** that I have at home, the power block stuff,

**00:54:07** they are in pounds.

**00:54:09** But in the UK, this is crazy to me,

**00:54:12** in most, but not all gyms, weights are given in kilograms.

**00:54:18** Yeah.

**00:54:19** But a surprising, like when I go on gradations,

**00:54:21** a surprising number of gyms actually use both systems.

**00:54:27** And you won't know unless you ask someone to be like,

**00:54:29** wait, what's going on with these weights over here?

**00:54:32** Like 90% of stuff is in kilograms in the UK,

**00:54:35** but I would say 10% of stuff is in pounds.

**00:54:38** So by sheer number of times,

**00:54:42** I am most frequently exercising at home with my weights

**00:54:46** that are in pounds, especially this year,

**00:54:49** because of some of my theme stuff.

**00:54:50** I've also been going to my local gym a bunch

**00:54:53** because they have equipment that I don't.

**00:54:55** Their most things are in kilograms.

**00:54:58** So anyway, the long story short is in FitBod,

**00:55:03** the setting for changing between pounds and kilograms

**00:55:07** is in kind of a weird spot.

**00:55:09** And changing back and forth in FitBod

**00:55:11** is basically kind of a pain.

**00:55:13** And even within the same gyms in the UK,

**00:55:17** I sometimes need to calculate

**00:55:19** between pounds and kilograms, right?

**00:55:20** That's weird.

**00:55:22** It's very weird.

**00:55:22** So I made a decision.

**00:55:23** I was like, okay, what's the easiest thing that I can do?

**00:55:27** I should, in theory, because I'm in the UK,

**00:55:30** just do everything in kilograms.

**00:55:32** But since the weights in my house were pounds,

**00:55:34** and also since I grew up with pounds

**00:55:36** and still think in pounds, I was like, no.

**00:55:39** Just like Fahrenheit, right?

**00:55:40** Like I'm holding the line on pounds

**00:55:43** are the correct unit of weight.

**00:55:45** And so I made a bunch of shortcuts to just-

**00:55:48** Well, look, I'm not interested in your-

**00:55:50** I know, but here's the thing.

**00:55:52** You can say what you want,

**00:55:53** and I just need to state that I disagree.

**00:55:55** That's all.

**00:55:56** No one's gonna have to try and convince anyone of anything.

**00:55:59** I just feel like I need to just come out

**00:56:01** in favor of Celsius and kilograms.

**00:56:03** I mean, look, Fahrenheit is the best in height.

**00:56:06** We all know this.

**00:56:07** And pounds-

**00:56:08** Fahrenheit is the worst in height.

**00:56:09** Fahrenheit is the worst in height.

**00:56:11** I'm actually quite movable on pounds.

**00:56:13** I don't particularly wetted to pounds.

**00:56:15** I think kilograms are fine.

**00:56:16** But so I spent a little time

**00:56:18** and I just made some shortcuts to do the quick pounds

**00:56:21** to kilograms back and forth conversions.

**00:56:23** The reason I like kilograms is that the smaller is a gram

**00:56:29** and there's a hundred in a kilogram.

**00:56:30** I've got some bad news for you

**00:56:31** about how many grams are in a kilogram

**00:56:33** and what the word kilo means.

**00:56:35** And there's a thousand in a kilogram,

**00:56:36** let me allow forever.

**00:56:37** But like you got pounds and ounces,

**00:56:39** like how many ounces are in a pound?

**00:56:41** God damn, we don't need to have this conversation right now.

**00:56:43** This is why I also don't like feet and inches.

**00:56:46** It's like the similar thing.

**00:56:47** I was like, I can't remember all of this.

**00:56:49** I just want a simple thing of like,

**00:56:52** there's 100 or a thousand who could know

**00:56:54** between these things.

**00:56:56** I just appreciate you demonstrating the mistake

**00:56:59** that all of my physics students did.

**00:57:01** I'm like, this is one of these things that drives me crazy

**00:57:04** when people are like, the metric system is amazing.

**00:57:05** It's like the person saying that is almost always a nerd

**00:57:09** and overestimates how rarely normal people

**00:57:12** will make a mistake going back and forth.

**00:57:14** But the thing is though, great.

**00:57:16** Okay, I made the mistake,

**00:57:17** but I can see that I've made the mistake very quickly.

**00:57:21** I can't do the same thing for feet and inches

**00:57:24** or like pounds and ounces.

**00:57:26** If I say it's six and then actually it's nine,

**00:57:29** it's just not as easy to realize

**00:57:31** that I've made the mistake.

**00:57:32** It's totally fair.

**00:57:33** Like making the mistake is fine,

**00:57:35** but like how quickly can you correct it?

**00:57:36** And like, I will realize very quickly that,

**00:57:40** if I'm trying to do something like, oh, no way,

**00:57:42** this is nowhere near enough,

**00:57:43** but with pounds and ounces, you could be really close,

**00:57:46** but still wrong.

**00:57:48** Look, I made the mistake and I'm not editing it out.

**00:57:50** So I've at least got to try and defend myself, you know?

**00:57:53** Yeah, no, that's totally fair.

**00:57:54** That's totally fair.

**00:57:55** And the conversion system is better.

**00:57:57** Again, I just feel like everyone who doesn't,

**00:57:59** who didn't grow up with Imperial,

**00:58:00** overestimates how often you actually switch between the units.

**00:58:03** Like this is a much rarer thing.

**00:58:05** I mean, I did grow up with Imperial.

**00:58:07** The UK has a weird mixed system.

**00:58:09** I don't understand why.

**00:58:10** And there's this weird like counterculture

**00:58:12** of people trying to bring it back as well,

**00:58:14** which is like, get over yourself, man, it's gone.

**00:58:17** All right, like Imperial's gone.

**00:58:19** Nobody wants to deal in that anymore.

**00:58:21** Stop trying to bring gallons back into the equation.

**00:58:23** Yes, but you've literally picked the example

**00:58:25** where again, the UK has this strange mixed system.

**00:58:27** I know, but people wanna bring gallons

**00:58:28** and quarts back for milk.

**00:58:30** And it's like, what are you doing?

**00:58:31** Just like get over yourself.

**00:58:33** We've moved on.

**00:58:34** Oh, I'll agree with you there.

**00:58:35** Yeah, that ship has totally sailed.

**00:58:36** No one wants to live in this world.

**00:58:38** Everything's in liters and milliliters.

**00:58:41** Although I still kind of hate milliliters.

**00:58:43** There's a hundred milliliters in a liter.

**00:58:47** There's a thousand milliliters.

**00:58:49** Where are we going?

**00:58:54** Anything with milliliters is like,

**00:58:55** why does this tiny bottle have such a big number?

**00:58:59** I hate it.

**00:58:59** I hate it so much.

**00:59:02** This tiny bottle of water, how many milliliters?

**00:59:04** 300.

**00:59:05** Here's what I think we can all agree on.

**00:59:07** None of these systems are good.

**00:59:09** They're just like different forms of okay.

**00:59:11** What we can all agree on is you shouldn't have

**00:59:13** a mixed system, right?

**00:59:15** Yes.

**00:59:16** Which a surprising number of countries do.

**00:59:19** Yeah.

**00:59:19** It's like the UK, India, Canada,

**00:59:22** like they've got these mixed systems.

**00:59:24** It's like, guys, pick a side, right?

**00:59:27** Pick a side.

**00:59:28** Anyway, apps.

**00:59:30** Apps, let's go back to apps.

**00:59:32** Anyway, unit conversions.

**00:59:34** You know what?

**00:59:35** They're really annoying.

**00:59:36** So you can make shortcuts to do it for you.

**00:59:39** I'll just point out, the two you asked about there

**00:59:42** is like plate calculators and Smith plate calculators.

**00:59:45** So I was originally just doing the math in my head

**00:59:48** and then I was like, well, this is dumb, right?

**00:59:49** This is what machines are for.

**00:59:50** Just have the machine do it for you.

**00:59:52** And the advantage of making your own little shortcut

**00:59:54** is when doing things like the bench press or whatever,

**00:59:57** you can have the shortcut,

**01:00:00** because I'm thinking in pounds, right?

**01:00:01** But it's like, I want a thing in kilograms.

**01:00:03** Also then round to the correct unit of the plates

**01:00:08** in the gym that you're in

**01:00:10** and kind of like spit out the number in a format

**01:00:12** that you want, right?

**01:00:13** Because you're putting plates on the bar.

**01:00:14** So that's partly why I have these shortcuts there

**01:00:16** is like, there's the regular machines.

**01:00:18** There's the Smith machines, which I don't love.

**01:00:21** And for incomprehensible reasons,

**01:00:23** they have a different bar weight

**01:00:24** than just like a regular Olympic bar.

**01:00:26** I always feel like curse you Smith inventor

**01:00:30** of this stupid machine.

**01:00:32** I hate it, but oftentimes it's,

**01:00:35** if I don't want to wait around in the gym forever,

**01:00:36** it's like this is the one.

**01:00:37** It's like the Imperial version of the weight equipment.

**01:00:39** Yeah, I don't know what it is.

**01:00:40** It's like, I hate it.

**01:00:42** It's clearly designed so that people don't injure themselves,

**01:00:46** but like, I just don't understand how it's been elevated

**01:00:49** to be like every gym has one of these.

**01:00:52** And it always feels like it would be much better

**01:00:54** just to have a regular Olympic bar here.

**01:00:56** That's what everybody wants.

**01:00:57** Nobody wants this Smith machine, but whatever.

**01:01:00** I'll use it if it's the only thing that's free.

**01:01:01** So that's why I have it there.

**01:01:03** These are like shortcuts that do real work for me

**01:01:06** all the time, right?

**01:01:07** Like just I'm putting in a number, give me the thing.

**01:01:10** Great, boom, boom, boom.

**01:01:11** Those are the three plates I need.

**01:01:12** Put them on, fantastic.

**01:01:14** The last little thing there,

**01:01:15** which I'll talk about later in the year,

**01:01:18** but I've been very intentionally doing a lot of like zone

**01:01:20** to heart exercise this year.

**01:01:23** And on the list of things, that's incredibly frustrating.

**01:01:26** It's like, Apple doesn't track this as a separate metric.

**01:01:30** Like they'll tell you after each exercise,

**01:01:32** how much time you've spent in zone two heart rate.

**01:01:35** But there's nowhere to get this data

**01:01:37** just as an aggregate out of the app.

**01:01:40** I was even looking into with shortcuts,

**01:01:42** like can I manually pull out

**01:01:44** like the heart ranges and backwards count?

**01:01:46** No, you can't get access to this.

**01:01:48** Very frustrating.

**01:01:49** So because I want to keep track of how much time

**01:01:52** per two weeks am I spending in zone two.

**01:01:55** Again, just made a little shortcut

**01:01:57** that asked me for a number of minutes,

**01:02:00** which I'm getting at the end of the exercise.

**01:02:02** And then that shortcut just, boop.

**01:02:04** It spits it into a little spreadsheets in numbers.

**01:02:07** So you're doing some manual.

**01:02:07** I'm doing manual entry here.

**01:02:09** So you're going to the health app,

**01:02:11** looking at your workout,

**01:02:13** it tells you the zone breakdown

**01:02:15** and then you're putting that in.

**01:02:16** That's an annoying system, isn't it?

**01:02:18** I'm putting that number in.

**01:02:19** It's incredibly annoying.

**01:02:21** It's very frustrating.

**01:02:22** It's like, if I didn't care so much,

**01:02:24** I wouldn't bother doing this,

**01:02:25** but I actually really care about this metric.

**01:02:27** But every time it makes me curse the Apple health app,

**01:02:30** like again, all year there's been this theme of like

**01:02:34** Apple health app, right?

**01:02:35** I give you like my anti app of the year award.

**01:02:37** Like there's nothing that I use more

**01:02:39** that is also more frustrating.

**01:02:41** And this is like one of these key things of like,

**01:02:44** you know this number.

**01:02:45** I know you know, because you're telling it to me

**01:02:48** when I'm done with the exercise.

**01:02:50** I wonder if it's in the API.

**01:02:52** Yeah, it's an interesting question.

**01:02:53** I wonder if you can.

**01:02:54** Under school, can you let us know?

**01:02:56** Yeah.

**01:02:57** Can you tell us if anybody knows, Dave?

**01:03:00** Yeah, you can copy paste some code just to make it work,

**01:03:03** right?

**01:03:04** Just like copy paste the thing.

**01:03:05** So that's what I'm doing with input zone two there.

**01:03:07** It's just like throwing it into my own spreadsheet.

**01:03:08** So then I can just see like, okay, cool.

**01:03:10** I'm like above or below the average

**01:03:11** that I'm looking for with this number.

**01:03:12** Yeah.

**01:03:13** Okay, so that's that's blowing past my very easy method,

**01:03:16** just speed.

**01:03:17** So we're up to Saturn.

**01:03:19** So Saturn now Mike, what mode is going to be Saturn?

**01:03:25** This one you must associate it, please.

**01:03:28** Well, I guess based on what you said,

**01:03:29** it's like the most showy off full of your focus modes.

**01:03:34** Do you have fashion focus?

**01:03:35** What is it?

**01:03:36** It's the weekend, Saturn.

**01:03:38** Okay.

**01:03:39** For Saturday.

**01:03:40** Saturn day.

**01:03:41** Yeah, Saturn day.

**01:03:42** That's where it comes from.

**01:03:43** Oh, don't you say that to me,

**01:03:45** because I'll tell that to other people.

**01:03:47** CGP Grey told me.

**01:03:51** Oh boy.

**01:03:52** Okay.

**01:03:53** There's not much to say here.

**01:03:54** Saturn is for Saturday for the weekends.

**01:03:56** Again, other like pretty clear thing.

**01:03:58** I just want the weather.

**01:04:00** I have a little yellow watch face

**01:04:01** that I kind of hate to match.

**01:04:03** That just shows me like the top thing in OmniFocus.

**01:04:07** I don't like this color.

**01:04:08** For the watch face.

**01:04:09** Yeah, but just in general, the yellow.

**01:04:11** I don't like that.

**01:04:12** Yeah.

**01:04:13** It's like pews almost like it's not even really yellow.

**01:04:16** It's got like too much green in it.

**01:04:18** I feel like I don't like it.

**01:04:19** This is a, this is kind of like a compromise color.

**01:04:22** Yeah.

**01:04:23** I've got too many things clashing up against each other.

**01:04:26** I've always used yellow as free time

**01:04:29** in all of my calendar blocking and time tracking.

**01:04:32** This is a problem just with human eyes.

**01:04:33** We don't perceive enough colors, right?

**01:04:35** You really only have seven.

**01:04:38** And it's a surprisingly few number to work with

**01:04:40** for lots of different things.

**01:04:41** So I go with the yellow.

**01:04:43** Saturn is like basically a yellowy kind of planet.

**01:04:46** But if I actually, as I did with the little eyedropper,

**01:04:49** match the exact color of Saturn

**01:04:52** to be the yellow that's going to be displayed,

**01:04:54** it doesn't look right at all.

**01:04:55** It doesn't read as yellow on pure black.

**01:04:57** So yeah, this is my least favorite aesthetically.

**01:05:00** It's a compromise.

**01:05:01** I acknowledge that.

**01:05:02** Well, like a goldy color, but then I'll do the job.

**01:05:05** I could try something like that.

**01:05:06** Yeah, I might want to try that.

**01:05:09** The real frustration is when we go over to the watch face

**01:05:13** that I can't quite get a yellow that works right

**01:05:16** for the focus mode.

**01:05:18** And so it has to have like this little green dot on the top.

**01:05:21** This is another one of these things.

**01:05:22** Apple, please, I'm begging you.

**01:05:24** Your watch faces are so ugly so often already.

**01:05:28** Do we have to show the icon for the focus mode

**01:05:32** on top of the watch?

**01:05:33** It's just there to ruin the look of the watch constantly.

**01:05:38** You know what goes on the top of the watch

**01:05:41** is the notification dot, right?

**01:05:43** So why is there now something else up there?

**01:05:45** Yeah.

**01:05:46** I hate that.

**01:05:47** I hate it so much.

**01:05:49** Why on the watch?

**01:05:51** Why does it have to persistently tell me

**01:05:53** what the focus mode I'm in?

**01:05:54** It's crazy because again, when you pull up a control center

**01:05:56** on the watch, it's also right there.

**01:05:58** Like which focus mode are you in?

**01:06:00** I don't understand.

**01:06:01** The only way to disable this as far as I can tell

**01:06:04** is to disable the watch paying attention

**01:06:06** to focus modes at all,

**01:06:08** which completely cripples all of its functionality.

**01:06:12** It's infuriating.

**01:06:14** I swear, if I could lift up the screen of my Apple watch

**01:06:19** and with a pin, manually blind and break

**01:06:23** every one of the pixels that displays the focus mode

**01:06:28** and just have them be permanently black, I would do it.

**01:06:31** I would do that to get rid of this

**01:06:33** and just deal with a black hole on the top of my watch.

**01:06:36** I hate it so much.

**01:06:38** I think we have one more.

**01:06:40** Yeah, I was gonna say we've got just the final one.

**01:06:42** Also boring, which is core.

**01:06:45** So we go out to Neptune for core.

**01:06:50** Neptune, another perfect emotional planet here.

**01:06:55** Oh, great.

**01:06:57** Like I've just gone to the home screen.

**01:06:59** They have such little on this home screen,

**01:07:02** but just so you know for the next 54 days,

**01:07:06** St. Nick's Day's coming.

**01:07:08** Make sure you don't forget, you count it down every day,

**01:07:12** St. Nick's Day.

**01:07:13** So Mike is making fun of me because last year

**01:07:15** you recommended a little app called Up ahead,

**01:07:18** which is just a simple little like,

**01:07:20** hey, what's up next kind of app.

**01:07:23** And I really like it.

**01:07:25** And I am indeed counting down to St. Nick's Day.

**01:07:29** You laugh.

**01:07:31** I do.

**01:07:31** I do.

**01:07:32** You're right.

**01:07:33** But it's very serious to me

**01:07:35** because St. Nick's Day is for me

**01:07:40** basically the mark of the end of the year.

**01:07:43** All serious work should really be wrapped up

**01:07:48** by St. Nick's Day.

**01:07:49** It's not that work doesn't happen after that,

**01:07:52** but this to me is really like big things are done now

**01:07:58** and you need to set aside some time

**01:08:02** to actually enjoy the holiday season.

**01:08:05** So that's why I have it there.

**01:08:06** That's why it's on my core work screen

**01:08:10** is it is a countdown of like,

**01:08:12** how much time do you really have left for serious work?

**01:08:18** If you're going to have a video up in December,

**01:08:21** you should really try to have it done before St. Nick's Day.

**01:08:24** If you don't want to ruin your whole month, right?

**01:08:28** Trying to get this done before the end of the year.

**01:08:31** That's why that's up there.

**01:08:32** It's the 6th of December.

**01:08:34** I didn't know this.

**01:08:35** I had to Google it and I'm just helping people

**01:08:37** who were like, what is St. Nick's Day?

**01:08:39** Cause I also didn't know what St. Nick's Day was.

**01:08:42** I have St. Nick's Day as the 5th of December,

**01:08:45** but different places celebrate St. Nick's Day

**01:08:48** on different days.

**01:08:49** And there's a St. Nick's Eve, which is on the 5th.

**01:08:52** Wait, so do you observe Imperial or Metric St. Nick's Day?

**01:08:55** I observe Imperial St. Nick's Day

**01:08:58** as all good Dutch descendants do.

**01:09:01** Ah, okay.

**01:09:03** I wondered why, like why have I no idea about this,

**01:09:06** but I guess.

**01:09:07** As the child of a Dutch immigrant,

**01:09:10** St. Nick's Day was an annual thing every time growing up.

**01:09:13** It's like similar to how like a lot of European countries,

**01:09:16** they celebrate Christmas and Christmas Eve.

**01:09:18** Like it's when people open their presents and stuff.

**01:09:20** Yeah, so we also basically did Christmas on Christmas Eve

**01:09:23** for the exact same reason.

**01:09:25** This is how things were done in the old world

**01:09:27** before we emigrated to the United States.

**01:09:29** I have no idea what happened there

**01:09:31** where like it's the same traditions,

**01:09:33** but people do them on different days.

**01:09:35** Like in the days off by one,

**01:09:37** I have no idea how that happened.

**01:09:39** I don't need to know.

**01:09:39** But yes, you're exactly right.

**01:09:41** It's like St. Nick's Day is kind of like Christmas

**01:09:43** and this is it St. Nick's Day or is it Christmas Eve

**01:09:46** or is it St. Nick's Eve?

**01:09:48** Like this same confusion has totally happened

**01:09:50** in different places.

**01:09:51** Well, only 54 days to go, so.

**01:09:54** Don't remind me.

**01:09:55** I don't need to.

**01:09:56** Which it does enough every day.

**01:09:58** I don't need to, you have an app that does it.

**01:10:00** Yeah, so that's the core one.

**01:10:02** Then just lastly, my watch face for the core.

**01:10:06** I'm kind of happy with it.

**01:10:07** Again, it's that ultra face.

**01:10:09** I think it looks pretty good in blue.

**01:10:10** I've got OmniFocus in the center for what I need to do.

**01:10:13** And that's it, that's it.

**01:10:15** What is that on the bottom right?

**01:10:16** On the bottom right, that's the fasting timer again.

**01:10:18** In the middle is a very old app,

**01:10:22** which is called Better Date,

**01:10:24** which just shows the current date,

**01:10:26** but it has a little progress slider

**01:10:28** for how far you are in the month.

**01:10:31** I should probably have this more prominent

**01:10:32** because I'm just constantly forgetting when it is,

**01:10:35** but I do like this one.

**01:10:36** I'm like, ooh, we have a progress bar throughout the month.

**01:10:38** How close are we to the end?

**01:10:40** I don't just want the number.

**01:10:41** I want to see the little visual indicator.

**01:10:43** And so there we are.

**01:10:44** We've wrapped up the introduction to State of the Apps.

**01:10:48** This is an entire, we've done an entire episode already.

**01:10:52** We could just be done and that's it.

**01:10:55** But yet this, we just introduced it.

**01:10:58** But we're not done.

**01:11:00** This episode of Clawtex is brought to you by Fitbot.

**01:11:04** When you want to change your fitness level,

**01:11:06** it can be hard to know where to start.

**01:11:08** That's why I'm pleased to let you know

**01:11:10** that Fitbot is an easy and affordable way

**01:11:12** to build a fitness plan just for you.

**01:11:15** You have heard us talk about Fitbot,

**01:11:16** I think every year in State of the Apps

**01:11:19** for a very good reason.

**01:11:20** Fitbot is the very best fitness app out there.

**01:11:23** It's incredibly easy to use.

**01:11:25** They have over 1,400 HD video tutorials

**01:11:29** shot from multiple angles

**01:11:30** to make sure that learning every exercise is a breeze.

**01:11:33** They have achievements that you can keep track of

**01:11:35** and personal bests that are great progress tracking charts

**01:11:38** have been the app.

**01:11:39** It integrates with your smartwatch and other apps

**01:11:42** like Strava, Fitbit and Apple Health.

**01:11:44** But ultimately what makes Fitbot so great,

**01:11:46** it's a great app, it looks good to use,

**01:11:48** but what makes them so great is the algorithm

**01:11:51** that they have built to make sure that you are keeping

**01:11:54** on track with your fitness goals.

**01:11:56** Fitbot knows that everybody has their own path

**01:11:59** to personal fitness.

**01:12:00** That's when it sticks

**01:12:01** and it's when you actually see a difference.

**01:12:03** They learn about you, your goals

**01:12:05** and your training ability to create a custom dynamic program

**01:12:08** based on your experience and any equipment you have.

**01:12:11** This is all within an app that is so easy to use.

**01:12:14** Superior results are achieved when a workout program

**01:12:17** is tailored to your unique body,

**01:12:19** experience, environment and goals.

**01:12:22** They understand that you don't wanna overwork muscles

**01:12:24** or underwork muscles.

**01:12:26** This can negatively impact your results

**01:12:28** so they design a well-balanced workout routine

**01:12:30** that is for you.

**01:12:31** They mix up your muscle groups, exercises, sets, reps

**01:12:34** and weight over time.

**01:12:35** This will increase your overall strength,

**01:12:37** keep your body sharp and keep your sessions fresh and fun

**01:12:41** by mixing up your workouts with new exercises.

**01:12:44** Gray and I have spoken about the big impact Fitbot had

**01:12:48** in our personal fitness journey.

**01:12:50** If you've yet to try it out, now is a great time.

**01:12:52** Personalized training of this quality can be expensive.

**01:12:55** Fitbot though is just 12.99 a month or 79.99 a year,

**01:12:59** but you can get a huge 25% of your membership

**01:13:21** Productivity apps.

**01:13:22** The cornerstone of our productivity app system

**01:13:25** is the To Do app.

**01:13:26** It is the To Do app.

**01:13:28** That is the absolute core.

**01:13:31** You know, when I sat down this year, Gray,

**01:13:33** to start my notes, I thought to myself,

**01:13:37** I'm very content with Todoist as my To Do app.

**01:13:40** Does everything the way that I want

**01:13:42** and I have no desire to move apps anymore.

**01:13:45** I'm very happy with Todoist.

**01:13:47** Gray, how are you feeling?

**01:13:49** I'm feeling nervous, Mike.

**01:13:50** Yeah.

**01:13:51** I'm not gonna lie, I'm feeling a little nervous.

**01:13:54** Honestly, I feel nervous for you, really.

**01:13:56** Yeah, so the situation is obviously

**01:13:59** I've been using OmniFocus for years,

**01:14:01** but also for what is now a growing percentage

**01:14:05** of those years, I have been hearing about OmniFocus 4,

**01:14:09** which is in the works.

**01:14:11** The OmniFocus 4 first look was published on May 10th, 2021.

**01:14:19** Oof.

**01:14:20** Right.

**01:14:21** That was when they started the beta for OmniFocus 4.

**01:14:24** That's when they started the public beta of it.

**01:14:27** But I know, I spoke to people in person

**01:14:29** about OmniFocus 4 before then,

**01:14:32** when I was a bit like,

**01:14:33** hey, what's going on with this thing?

**01:14:37** Yeah, so the OmniFocus blog has been over this time

**01:14:43** publishing updates about what's going on

**01:14:45** and how they're moving forward.

**01:14:47** And the entire time they have been insisting

**01:14:50** that they are on schedule to release

**01:14:52** the next version of OmniFocus

**01:14:54** and that this is not any different than the amount of time

**01:14:57** between the previous versions of OmniFocus.

**01:15:00** And I think all of that is true.

**01:15:02** I kind of take them at their word for this.

**01:15:04** But the end result though is like,

**01:15:07** boy, if it is going to be years between major updates,

**01:15:13** it starts to become a problem.

**01:15:15** And I feel like the latest release of iOS

**01:15:19** and particularly Sonoma has just pushed this

**01:15:22** really over the edge.

**01:15:24** And I was feeling like, boy, I just,

**01:15:27** I hope OmniFocus is there,

**01:15:29** like right after the OS goes out and it wasn't.

**01:15:34** And boy, OmniFocus just feels so old and creaky

**01:15:39** on the current operating systems.

**01:15:42** They're saying later this year.

**01:15:43** I know that they're saying later this year,

**01:15:45** but I feel like it's really bad to miss the iOS launch

**01:15:49** and the Sonoma launch.

**01:15:51** Even if that was always your plan,

**01:15:53** like, oh, we're going to do it later this year,

**01:15:55** I just don't think it's good.

**01:15:56** And it particularly doesn't look good

**01:15:58** because there's no interactive widgets.

**01:16:01** Like none of that widget stuff works.

**01:16:03** The widgets that exist on iOS, like they are fine,

**01:16:07** but they feel very crowbarred into the system

**01:16:10** and they just kind of don't look good.

**01:16:12** They don't scale properly with anything.

**01:16:15** I will say Todoist's widgets are terrible.

**01:16:18** They're really bad.

**01:16:19** They've always been bad,

**01:16:20** but I don't want a widget of my Todo app on my home screen.

**01:16:25** Anyway, but they are very bad.

**01:16:28** Yes, like on my Mac, I was trying to use the widgets,

**01:16:31** but like OmniFocus was showing up as a like,

**01:16:34** you could see the square block that was getting rendered

**01:16:38** for the widget like inside the round borders is like,

**01:16:41** oof, that does not look good.

**01:16:43** Wow.

**01:16:44** Anyway, it's just one of these things of like,

**01:16:46** boy, they're just slowly adding up things where it feels like

**01:16:49** this just does not work great in the system.

**01:16:53** Again, I want to emphasize I've stuck with it

**01:16:56** because nothing is broken,

**01:16:58** but it just feels increasingly like, oh my God,

**01:17:03** this is very out of step with the current operating systems.

**01:17:07** And like little things just keep adding up,

**01:17:09** just like the minimum physical size that OmniFocus

**01:17:14** will take up on the screen is like quite large.

**01:17:16** It's like trying to make it fit in the little corners

**01:17:19** can be really frustrating.

**01:17:20** So what I dream happens is like, oh,

**01:17:24** OmniFocus 4 gets released between the time

**01:17:26** that we record this episode and when it goes live,

**01:17:29** and I don't have to worry about anything anymore.

**01:17:32** But the truth is I am just concerned.

**01:17:36** And I was concerned enough that last month,

**01:17:40** I did a kind of tour of the other to-do systems that exist.

**01:17:45** I was like, I just want to refresh my view of the field.

**01:17:49** Like what is out here?

**01:17:50** What's available?

**01:17:52** This tour went all the way back to Remember the Milk.

**01:17:56** Oh jeez.

**01:17:57** It's like, let me survey everything

**01:18:01** that I would reasonably use.

**01:18:04** Remember the Milk was extra hilarious

**01:18:06** because I found my super old account

**01:18:09** and logged into it where it had to-dos left over

**01:18:12** from my teaching career.

**01:18:14** Like to-do list archeology.

**01:18:16** I'm like, wow, look at this whole system.

**01:18:18** That's amazing.

**01:18:19** I mean, the truth is though,

**01:18:20** I have one just such an incredible deal breaker

**01:18:24** for to-do systems.

**01:18:26** And it is this concept of the start date.

**01:18:28** And I am still just blown away

**01:18:31** by how many apps don't have this implemented at all

**01:18:35** or implement it very badly.

**01:18:38** Like there are lots of things that OmniFocus does

**01:18:40** that are great, but like this to me is the key

**01:18:44** and it is the single thing that makes it the hardest

**01:18:46** to move from absolutely anything else.

**01:18:49** So after my survey of the field,

**01:18:52** I kind of had to make a decision.

**01:18:53** I was like, all right,

**01:18:55** assume that OmniFocus will not release this year.

**01:18:59** Will you still use it?

**01:19:01** And the answer I came to was yes,

**01:19:04** I will still use it

**01:19:06** because the other options are significantly less appealing

**01:19:10** to me, but boy, I would not be happy about that.

**01:19:14** So I have not used OmniFocus for a long time.

**01:19:17** I was on the beta,

**01:19:18** but I let my beta expire at some point,

**01:19:20** sometime last year or whatever.

**01:19:22** And I will be frank and say,

**01:19:25** like I did not like the way the app felt to use.

**01:19:29** They were moving to SwiftUI

**01:19:31** and that's what they have stuck with.

**01:19:34** And the app just didn't feel right to use.

**01:19:38** And maybe they've changed it.

**01:19:40** I don't know, but I'm just gonna say,

**01:19:42** let's just imagine that enough has changed

**01:19:43** about the application that you don't like using

**01:19:46** the application anymore.

**01:19:47** Well, then what do you do?

**01:19:49** Cause like it is a new design.

**01:19:51** Like the design is changing.

**01:19:52** Like you can see it in the imagery that I've shared.

**01:19:55** It is very similar of course to the OmniFocus that you know,

**01:20:00** but it's different.

**01:20:02** Yeah.

**01:20:03** I mean, I haven't used it in the beta.

**01:20:05** I've only seen the screenshots.

**01:20:07** I actually don't really have any problem with the screenshots.

**01:20:09** I'm not quite sure why people don't seem

**01:20:12** to like the design of that.

**01:20:13** I didn't like the way the app felt to use,

**01:20:16** but again, it was in beta, right?

**01:20:18** Like I gotta be fair and say like it wasn't finished

**01:20:21** and it was a long time ago,

**01:20:23** but there was just something about it

**01:20:25** where it did not have the pleasant feeling

**01:20:28** that I'd had using the app before,

**01:20:29** but who knows where it is right now.

**01:20:31** I genuinely don't know.

**01:20:32** Yeah.

**01:20:33** But this is a problem with like,

**01:20:34** so when I was surveying the field of to-do list apps,

**01:20:37** this is a recurring problem where lots of these apps,

**01:20:41** because they have an idea of working with teams or whatever,

**01:20:44** like they're using different systems.

**01:20:46** So some apps like did have start dates,

**01:20:48** but it would be the same thing where I'd feel like

**01:20:51** I just clearly don't like using this.

**01:20:53** Like this is unpleasant to use in a way

**01:20:56** that is difficult to pin down.

**01:20:59** Like I can't exactly articulate why, but I don't like it.

**01:21:04** It's a funny thing.

**01:21:05** Like we used to say on the show that the market

**01:21:07** for to-do apps was infinite,

**01:21:10** but I think I was also quite surprised

**01:21:12** in how remarkably unchanged this whole world is

**01:21:18** since the last time I really went to look around.

**01:21:21** Like I kind of thought, oh, I'll find some new apps

**01:21:23** that I was unaware of since the last time.

**01:21:25** The answer was like, no, not really.

**01:21:27** Like it's the same few ones that are the default answers

**01:21:31** for absolutely everyone.

**01:21:33** It's like, you've got OmniFocus, you've got to-do list,

**01:21:36** and like, and all of the friends,

**01:21:38** and like these are the things to choose from.

**01:21:39** So I might have to amend that to be something like,

**01:21:43** oh, the desire for to-do apps is infinite

**01:21:46** because everybody always wants them to work

**01:21:48** in their own specific way.

**01:21:50** But maybe something about the actual market market

**01:21:53** just can't support a large number of these things

**01:21:56** or there's other like non-obvious reasons

**01:21:59** why there aren't a ton of brand new ones that have popped up.

**01:22:03** So that's my situation is I am using OmniFocus.

**01:22:08** I will probably still continue to use OmniFocus,

**01:22:11** but I am concerned at this point in time

**01:22:15** where things feel potentially uncertain.

**01:22:19** And even if there is a transition,

**01:22:21** like I'll have to see what it is actually like

**01:22:24** before the next version,

**01:22:26** when it comes out later this year.

**01:22:29** I hope for success for them and for you.

**01:22:31** Me too.

**01:22:32** I really do.

**01:22:33** And I understand that like, you know,

**01:22:35** this takes a long time,

**01:22:37** but it's, I feel like they're going in a different direction

**01:22:40** and I hope it plays off.

**01:22:41** So that was a bummer.

**01:22:42** Yeah.

**01:22:43** Tell me about how you're happy, Mike.

**01:22:45** Oh yeah.

**01:22:46** Well, I mean, just in general,

**01:22:47** to-do list does exactly what I need.

**01:22:48** Lucky you.

**01:22:49** Cause I keep things relatively simple and you don't.

**01:22:53** People have different systems.

**01:22:54** I keep mine relatively simple, you know, tasks,

**01:22:57** they all of them have a due date

**01:22:59** and they all go in a project.

**01:23:00** That is essentially all I'm doing.

**01:23:02** And I like that Todoist has a couple of views.

**01:23:05** If you can show me my tasks for today,

**01:23:07** you can show me all my upcoming tasks

**01:23:09** in a chronological list.

**01:23:11** And then if I want to, I can go into any of my projects.

**01:23:14** It's just a simple system, but it works well for me.

**01:23:18** So I'm happy with it, you know?

**01:23:20** Yeah.

**01:23:21** So the Todoist is a good to-do manager.

**01:23:22** Should in many ways be kind of invisible?

**01:23:25** Like it's not the thing.

**01:23:26** Exactly.

**01:23:27** It's the thing that's pointing you

**01:23:29** to what you actually need to do.

**01:23:30** Again, I will ding them for the poor widget support.

**01:23:33** I think that that is a very strange thing

**01:23:35** that they haven't done it

**01:23:36** cause a lot of people would like it.

**01:23:37** And their widgets last year weren't good anyway.

**01:23:40** I like the widgets that they added.

**01:23:42** Like it was just like a weird list of things

**01:23:44** that was like cropped in a strange way,

**01:23:46** just like lines of text.

**01:23:47** As of right now,

**01:23:48** they've not added any kind of interactivity

**01:23:50** to their widgets.

**01:23:52** I don't understand why, but that's where they are.

**01:23:54** But the thing that I am most in love with

**01:23:56** when it comes to my Todoist system right now

**01:23:58** is the action button on my iPhone 15 Pro Max.

**01:24:02** Oh, okay.

**01:24:03** So on the Mac,

**01:24:05** it's very easy to put tasks into Todoist.

**01:24:09** I just hit command option in the space bar

**01:24:12** and it brings up the Todoist quick entry window.

**01:24:15** And I can just add a task no matter what I'm doing, right?

**01:24:20** There is no way to do such a thing

**01:24:23** when I'm using my iPhone.

**01:24:24** I can have a shortcut,

**01:24:26** but I have to go somewhere else to activate the shortcut.

**01:24:30** Like if I'm in Slack and I want to add a task to Todoist,

**01:24:35** I have to leave Slack.

**01:24:37** Right, okay.

**01:24:39** Or I have to pull down my notification shade,

**01:24:42** slide to the left and hit a shortcut or whatever,

**01:24:44** or like pull it down

**01:24:45** and maybe I can hit the shortcut from the lock screen.

**01:24:47** But there's always a leaving of the app to do this.

**01:24:52** Enter the action button,

**01:24:54** where now I can just press and hold the action button

**01:24:58** and it will pop up a shortcut that I have written

**01:25:02** to add a task.

**01:25:03** And it doesn't leave the app.

**01:25:05** I can still see things that are in the window.

**01:25:08** Oh, right, okay.

**01:25:09** So it's just pulling down the text entry from the top.

**01:25:12** Yeah, and I just use the keyboard.

**01:25:15** So this was a suggestion that our friend Federico made

**01:25:18** when we were thinking about the action button.

**01:25:20** And I've kind of adapted it a little bit further as well.

**01:25:23** So at first it was just like,

**01:25:25** give me a little Todoist task, awesome.

**01:25:27** And I would do that.

**01:25:29** But then it became like, well,

**01:25:31** what about if I want to add something to do as well?

**01:25:36** So what I've done is it says, watch your task.

**01:25:38** I tap out the name of the task.

**01:25:40** It says, what time do you want it to be?

**01:25:42** And I can put that time in natural language if I want to.

**01:25:45** It can make it look very simple.

**01:25:46** And it says, what app do you want to add it to?

**01:25:49** And I choose either Todoist or DUE.

**01:25:52** And then it will just add it to the app that I've chosen.

**01:25:55** So it's just like a pretty simple shortcut

**01:25:57** that just uses the native shortcuts for Todoist and DUE

**01:26:00** to just add in the information

**01:26:02** that I'm putting in a text box.

**01:26:03** It's very simple.

**01:26:05** And then also Federico built a shortcut called MultiButton,

**01:26:09** which lets you add a second action to the action button

**01:26:13** based on a timer.

**01:26:14** So like if you press the action button

**01:26:17** and like do the action or press cancel

**01:26:19** and then press it again within seven seconds,

**01:26:22** it will run a second action that you've chosen.

**01:26:25** It's very clever.

**01:26:26** Currently I have this set to reminders,

**01:26:28** but I'm thinking of adding that into the first one.

**01:26:30** I'll get to reminders in a minute,

**01:26:32** but like I'm enjoying playing around

**01:26:34** with the action button stuff.

**01:26:35** Federico's thing is super cool.

**01:26:37** I'll put a link conditioner to it

**01:26:38** if you want to read more about it.

**01:26:39** But my very favorite thing is just how easy it is

**01:26:41** for me to add things to my Todoist system now.

**01:26:44** Okay, I think you've totally sold me

**01:26:46** on what should the action button be?

**01:26:49** Because I just haven't...

**01:26:51** So bored by the colors and the new phone stuff.

**01:26:55** So I haven't even like ordered the phone.

**01:26:56** I don't have the action button or anything.

**01:26:58** So I haven't really thought about it.

**01:27:00** I've just like in a vague way, I was like,

**01:27:03** what might one do theoretically with an action button?

**01:27:06** And I was like, I guess the camera,

**01:27:08** the camera makes most sense,

**01:27:10** but you've totally sold me on.

**01:27:11** No, the correct thing here is input.

**01:27:14** This is a button for inputting into other systems,

**01:27:17** especially if T.G.'s magic to his way

**01:27:20** into doubling the functionality of the action button.

**01:27:24** Then I feel like, yeah, it's very clear.

**01:27:25** Like this is a default input button.

**01:27:27** Yeah, I really like it.

**01:27:28** It's just like, I could just press that button

**01:27:31** and add a task to my system.

**01:27:33** And it works very well.

**01:27:34** I mentioned reminders using this for family tasks now.

**01:27:38** We'd previously used Trello.

**01:27:39** I didn't like Trello,

**01:27:40** but now reminders has their kind of column Kanban view.

**01:27:44** It's finding the middle ground

**01:27:46** between both what me and Edina want.

**01:27:47** She really wants a column view.

**01:27:49** I don't really want to use Trello.

**01:27:51** And so I've really liked the way that reminders works

**01:27:54** from an entry perspective.

**01:27:55** It's very simple and I can access it

**01:27:58** from anywhere in the system.

**01:27:59** I don't like reminders as much as I like to do it.

**01:28:01** So I think for a lot of things reminders,

**01:28:03** you have to tap too many things.

**01:28:06** Like if you want to add a time to a task,

**01:28:09** you first have to slide a toggle

**01:28:11** to bring down the time thing,

**01:28:12** which is just very strange to me.

**01:28:14** But I like this more than I like Trello as a system.

**01:28:19** So that's working fine.

**01:28:21** And then because why not,

**01:28:22** let's put another one in the mix.

**01:28:23** I also use things.

**01:28:25** I love to do apps.

**01:28:26** I love to use all of them,

**01:28:26** but using for very different things.

**01:28:28** Things is used and has been for years

**01:28:30** for just checklists for me.

**01:28:32** I use it for my Cortex checklist.

**01:28:35** And I mentioned earlier,

**01:28:36** I also am now using it for a packing checklist.

**01:28:39** I moved out of notes.

**01:28:41** Things made some new shortcut actions

**01:28:43** to make it very easy to duplicate a template project

**01:28:47** in things and keep all of the formatting,

**01:28:50** like the headers and all that kind of stuff.

**01:28:52** So I now just have these two shortcuts,

**01:28:54** one for Cortex editing and posting

**01:28:56** and one for my packing list

**01:28:59** to just very easily duplicate these projects

**01:29:02** and have them become active.

**01:29:03** And so I use things for that.

**01:29:04** It's very nice.

**01:29:05** Yeah, I mean, Things wins clearly the award

**01:29:08** of best looking at sort of most pleasant to do app to use.

**01:29:13** Like it's just the design of things is amazing.

**01:29:15** And I always find myself like drawn to things

**01:29:19** and also just kills me because they sort of

**01:29:22** but not fully have start dates.

**01:29:24** Like they have fuzzy start dates

**01:29:26** might be the way to describe it.

**01:29:27** But yeah, like I find Things is like just a great looking app.

**01:29:30** It's been around for a long time.

**01:29:32** And it is also interesting to me

**01:29:33** how Reminders does keep improving year on year.

**01:29:37** It's also something I was like,

**01:29:38** oh, if Reminders ever added start dates,

**01:29:40** like I would be willing to simplify my system down

**01:29:44** to maybe use something like that.

**01:29:46** Because yeah, I guess Reminders is for me

**01:29:48** the only other task manager I really use.

**01:29:51** And that's purely because the Siri integration

**01:29:55** is just so dead easy.

**01:29:57** I will just constantly by voice throw to Siri things

**01:30:02** that I want to be remembered like in X units of time.

**01:30:05** Remind me in two weeks, remind me later this afternoon,

**01:30:08** remind me tomorrow morning.

**01:30:09** Like for those kind of one off things,

**01:30:11** talking to Siri to just add stuff into Reminders at a time

**01:30:14** is amazing, like I use that constantly.

**01:30:17** Do I even wanna ask what Notes app you use?

**01:30:19** I always feel like it's just such a minefield

**01:30:21** that I step into every time I ask you this question.

**01:30:24** I use the Notes app, like what else would I use?

**01:30:26** It's great.

**01:30:27** Okay.

**01:30:28** No complicated conversation to be had here.

**01:30:30** What do you do in the Notes app then?

**01:30:32** What goes in there?

**01:30:33** Notes go in there, all sorts of notes go in there.

**01:30:35** I feel like this is like a logic puzzle.

**01:30:40** Because like I use the Notes app for everything, right?

**01:30:44** I have a bunch of show notes stuff in there.

**01:30:46** I have personal notes in there.

**01:30:49** Yeah, I have 762 notes in the Notes app.

**01:30:51** I'd never delete anything.

**01:30:53** It just all goes in there and it's great.

**01:30:56** The only work stuff that doesn't go into Notes

**01:30:58** is Cortex-Bran stuff which goes into Notion.

**01:31:02** Right now, what are you using?

**01:31:03** Like what is going into, I'm assuming Apple Notes?

**01:31:08** What are you putting in there?

**01:31:09** I'm not using it for Notes really.

**01:31:10** It's more like I throw stuff into the Notes app

**01:31:14** that needs to be properly sorted later.

**01:31:17** 80 to 90% of that stuff is really a question of

**01:31:22** where in obsidian should this go?

**01:31:25** Or slash does this deserve to be put into obsidian?

**01:31:30** So I do use it as a kind of junk drawer

**01:31:35** for stuff that's later.

**01:31:37** Like oh, here's a thing to read.

**01:31:39** Here's a paper that's related to a video topic

**01:31:42** that you might want to look at later.

**01:31:44** I don't, for reasons we might get to later,

**01:31:47** I don't have a good way to throw that into obsidian directly.

**01:31:50** I'm not 100% sure I would even want to

**01:31:53** put in a lot of this stuff exists for me

**01:31:55** as a kind of limbo.

**01:31:56** Like Notes is a very transitory area.

**01:31:59** Nothing should ever permanently live here,

**01:32:02** but it's a useful place to put all of the stuff

**01:32:04** before I decide where does this go slash

**01:32:09** do I just delete this because future me doesn't care at all,

**01:32:12** which probably happens to the majority of stuff

**01:32:14** I put into Notes.

**01:32:15** It's like, oh, this might be interesting.

**01:32:17** It's like, no, it's not really.

**01:32:18** And then I just delete it.

**01:32:19** So that's how I use the Notes app.

**01:32:20** Where do they go?

**01:32:22** Okay, so like here's an example, right?

**01:32:24** Earlier today we were talking about

**01:32:25** a future Cortex brand project.

**01:32:28** And you showed me an example of like,

**01:32:31** here's a thing that we could do that's like this.

**01:32:32** And you showed me a website.

**01:32:33** And so I said, ah, great.

**01:32:35** I want to check that out later.

**01:32:37** And so what I do with that is I just like, boop, share it.

**01:32:39** So it just becomes a note in my Notes folder.

**01:32:44** Because this to me is the perfect example

**01:32:46** of what happens all the time.

**01:32:48** It's like, there's not really a task

**01:32:50** that's associated with this.

**01:32:52** We're not on any kind of remote timeline.

**01:32:54** It's just like, future Gray should take a look

**01:32:57** at this website and he will decide

**01:33:00** if any actions come out of this.

**01:33:03** Do we need to get in touch with anybody?

**01:33:04** Like what's the next step in this project, right?

**01:33:07** But right now it isn't anything.

**01:33:09** It's just like, oh, hey, take a look at this at some point.

**01:33:13** And I go, I will, where do I put that?

**01:33:16** I think where this threw me a little bit

**01:33:18** was like, this is the inbox model, right?

**01:33:22** Yeah, it's totally the inbox model.

**01:33:23** That's how I use Notes.

**01:33:25** Why not use the inbox in OmniFocus for this?

**01:33:30** I don't like using the inbox for that kind of stuff

**01:33:32** because it's not flexible enough.

**01:33:34** I hear a lot of people have these kinds of things.

**01:33:36** They have like a scratch pad note or whatever, right?

**01:33:38** Or like this little note where there's just one note

**01:33:41** where stuff gets added.

**01:33:42** But what I don't understand, like for me,

**01:33:45** is what prompts you to ever look at it?

**01:33:49** Like why does it not just become like a graveyard of things?

**01:33:53** What prompts me to look at it is that in OmniFocus,

**01:33:57** I have a repeating task,

**01:33:58** which is like clear out your notes folder.

**01:34:01** That's the only reason that this system works.

**01:34:04** If I didn't have an actual reminder,

**01:34:06** which is like clear this out,

**01:34:09** it would just be a graveyard of like,

**01:34:11** oh, stuff I thought once

**01:34:13** and never thought about again.

**01:34:16** Goodbye thought.

**01:34:18** So that's the only reason that this works.

**01:34:19** There's a task.

**01:34:20** All right, fair enough.

**01:34:21** There is a task.

**01:34:22** But again, the other reason I don't put it

**01:34:24** as an inbox item in OmniFocus

**01:34:26** is because I have learned from experience, right?

**01:34:29** You can't always count on future you to know

**01:34:32** like what was the thing about this, right?

**01:34:35** Like I will often just like write something quick

**01:34:38** in the notes itself about like,

**01:34:40** what is this for future me?

**01:34:41** What are you even thinking about?

**01:34:43** Like who gave this to you?

**01:34:44** So I like the free formness of it.

**01:34:47** And also for me,

**01:34:49** it kind of does just act like a traditional to do inbox

**01:34:53** because I'm not adding things to a single note.

**01:34:57** Each item is an individual note.

**01:35:00** So I can delete them one at a time

**01:35:01** as I'm going through things.

**01:35:02** So that's the way that I use it.

**01:35:03** To be productive, you must spend your time well.

**01:35:06** How is time management going for you?

**01:35:09** Well, how's time management going for you, Mike?

**01:35:10** Oh, no change.

**01:35:11** It's great.

**01:35:12** I use Timey full of Timey widgets.

**01:35:15** I will maybe some point next year,

**01:35:18** we'll do my little review of how I've been spending my time.

**01:35:21** But, you know, Timey is just continues to just get better

**01:35:25** and better and better all the time.

**01:35:26** I don't understand how Joe manages to do it,

**01:35:30** but like I just am more and more happy with the app.

**01:35:34** I love having the Timey widget on my Mac now,

**01:35:38** like on the desktop of my Mac.

**01:35:41** It's like another quick way to get to it.

**01:35:44** I have a little widget on my watch

**01:35:45** as well as on the complication.

**01:35:48** It's everywhere I need it to be.

**01:35:49** And it's super important to me that it's easy to access

**01:35:53** in so many different ways,

**01:35:54** whether it's through a shortcut or whatever.

**01:35:57** And it's just like a good way for me

**01:35:58** to keep track of what I'm doing.

**01:36:00** I think for me right now,

**01:36:03** the reason that I time track

**01:36:05** is so I can review it on an annual basis.

**01:36:08** That's my reason now.

**01:36:10** That data to me is so important

**01:36:13** when I'm thinking about my theme.

**01:36:15** It's so important when I'm thinking about

**01:36:17** how I wanna spend the time in my life and in my work.

**01:36:20** And I'm just so happy with the fact

**01:36:22** that this is an important tool to me,

**01:36:24** but what's important is the data.

**01:36:26** So what needs to be good is the way

**01:36:28** in which the data is collected.

**01:36:30** And so that requires Timey to be easy to use,

**01:36:33** easy to access and exactly where I need it

**01:36:35** on all the platforms that I use, and it is.

**01:36:37** And that's why I continue to use it

**01:36:39** religiously every day.

**01:36:40** Yeah, Timey is amazing.

**01:36:42** I have an upset though this year.

**01:36:44** Right, so I have switched from Timey.

**01:36:48** Wow.

**01:36:49** I'm using an app called Timelines.

**01:36:52** This is huge news.

**01:36:53** It's huge news.

**01:36:56** So Timey is amazing,

**01:36:58** but there is one specific use case

**01:37:01** where it does not work.

**01:37:03** And it does not work if you're offline.

**01:37:06** I've been doing a thing this year

**01:37:10** where I'm having big blocks

**01:37:14** where I'm just completely disconnected

**01:37:16** from the network at all.

**01:37:19** And so when I started doing this,

**01:37:22** I realized very fast,

**01:37:24** I need to find a time tracking app

**01:37:27** that can work offline,

**01:37:29** that does not require an internet connection

**01:37:32** to start and stop a timer.

**01:37:36** I looked around,

**01:37:37** there's a bunch of time tracking apps,

**01:37:39** but for me, there was one that just clearly stood

**01:37:42** above all of the others,

**01:37:44** and it is called Timelines.

**01:37:46** The interesting thing about this

**01:37:48** is the difference in our use cases.

**01:37:51** So like you said, you really care about the data.

**01:37:54** For me, I do not care about the data at all.

**01:37:57** This year in particular is like,

**01:38:00** oh wow, my data is just totally messed up, right?

**01:38:03** Because I was trying out a bunch

**01:38:04** of different time tracking apps.

**01:38:06** And when you do that, things don't work right.

**01:38:09** So you get timers that are running for like 36 hours

**01:38:12** and you miss all kinds of stuff.

**01:38:13** So like my data this year is totally messed up.

**01:38:17** But I don't care because I have always viewed

**01:38:22** the time tracking as much more a tool

**01:38:24** that assists in intentional decision-making.

**01:38:28** And it's a tool that I use on a scale of,

**01:38:33** how is this day going compared to other days?

**01:38:36** And the thing about Timelines is that

**01:38:39** it's clear that the developer of this app

**01:38:42** also kind of thinks about time tracking

**01:38:45** along the lines of how I do it,

**01:38:49** where they have things like,

**01:38:52** do you have a goal for how much time

**01:38:54** you want to spend on this task today?

**01:38:56** If you do, cool.

**01:38:58** We can put a little widget on the home screen

**01:39:00** that fills in a bar for like,

**01:39:02** how much time did you spend writing today?

**01:39:04** How much time did you spend exercising today?

**01:39:07** The one that I always feel like I'm fighting against

**01:39:09** is what I call like transition,

**01:39:12** which is I'm between two tasks.

**01:39:16** How much time in my day do I spend in transition?

**01:39:21** And so that one's a bit like,

**01:39:22** okay, I want to try to set a limit of like,

**01:39:24** don't go over this amount of transition time in a day.

**01:39:29** And then I can see a little bar of like,

**01:39:31** you're getting close.

**01:39:32** So I think it's a very nicely done app.

**01:39:35** It looks good.

**01:39:36** Like I said, for me, the main thing is that it works offline.

**01:39:40** I will say like,

**01:39:43** there are so many features from Timery that I do miss.

**01:39:48** And there are some decisions that I find kind of weird

**01:39:52** sometimes in the way that, like, for example,

**01:39:55** when you're looking at a pie chart

**01:39:56** of how you spend your time,

**01:39:57** it doesn't automatically sort the wedges by size,

**01:40:01** which I find just a very strange decision

**01:40:05** on how to actually show information.

**01:40:07** But again, because it is not critical for me to review

**01:40:13** at the end of the year, how my time was spent,

**01:40:16** I've really been liking this app

**01:40:17** as like solving a particular problem of,

**01:40:21** I'm spending more time like not connected

**01:40:23** to the internet at all,

**01:40:24** but I still want to have a time tracker that works for me.

**01:40:28** And this one is somewhat more aligned with the general way

**01:40:33** in which I'm wanting to use these apps anyway.

**01:40:36** So yeah, I've been using Timelines for,

**01:40:41** I think about two or three months at this point.

**01:40:44** And I like it.

**01:40:45** I like it a lot.

**01:40:46** Yeah, it's interesting.

**01:40:47** Visually, I do not like this app.

**01:40:49** Yeah, I can totally get it.

**01:40:51** Yeah.

**01:40:52** It looks old.

**01:40:53** So yeah, I think when you dig into some of the screens,

**01:40:57** like it definitely has a kind of older feel for it.

**01:41:01** This is also a case where with the new live widgets

**01:41:05** and things, so like on my standby lock screen in my office,

**01:41:09** I can just have it set to be like,

**01:41:11** show me the pie chart of how I've spent my day

**01:41:13** and then show me the bars of have I gone over

**01:41:16** or stayed under the times that I want.

**01:41:17** And it's like, that's what I want, right?

**01:41:20** That is like 100% of my interaction with this thing.

**01:41:22** Maybe in fairness, this is being skewed

**01:41:25** by me looking more at the website than the App Store

**01:41:28** screenshots because the website, I mean,

**01:41:30** they use anything iPhone 6.

**01:41:31** And so that's skewing by like how does it look?

**01:41:35** I mean, what I say is when looking at the App Store

**01:41:38** screenshots, it's just a plain app, which is not a bad thing.

**01:41:42** It's just a different style of design.

**01:41:45** One of the things that I really love about Timery

**01:41:48** is I think that the app is very attractive, which

**01:41:51** I haven't in the app quite a bit, so I like how it looks.

**01:41:54** Yeah, I mean, this is interesting.

**01:41:57** If that is a use case that you want, you're right.

**01:41:59** Timery does not work offline.

**01:42:01** It's not really a thing that I run into very often,

**01:42:03** but I guess, again, it comes down

**01:42:05** to the very different ways in which we time track.

**01:42:07** Like if I don't have an internet connection,

**01:42:11** I probably don't really have anything to track.

**01:42:13** For me, very often I do my most important work

**01:42:17** when I'm not connected to the internet.

**01:42:19** This used to be much more of an obvious thing

**01:42:21** for when I was flying.

**01:42:23** I was always a bit aware then of like, oh, right,

**01:42:25** I can't run Timery now.

**01:42:27** And very frequently, it's like, I do my best

**01:42:29** writing on an airplane.

**01:42:30** This is amazing.

**01:42:32** Obviously, flights have been a less frequent thing

**01:42:35** in most recent history, but I've sort of recreated

**01:42:40** that in my own life for a few reasons.

**01:42:43** It's more self-imposed, no internet connection.

**01:42:46** Yeah, and that's why I realized like, ah, OK.

**01:42:49** I actually do need this.

**01:42:51** I can't work around this because the most important stuff

**01:42:55** to track is also correlated with I'm not actually

**01:42:58** on the internet.

**01:42:59** So that's why I took a look and switched to timelines.

**01:43:02** That is the shock of the episode, I think.

**01:43:05** I don't know if we're going to get much more of a shock

**01:43:07** than that.

**01:45:25** Our thanks to Squarespace for their support of this show

**01:45:28** and Relay FM.

**01:45:30** All right, team and communication apps.

**01:45:32** I don't know about you, but I feel like we've both kind of

**01:45:35** ended up in exactly the same space

**01:45:37** here with the different apps that we're using.

**01:45:39** Well, probably not email.

**01:45:41** Email might be an outlier here.

**01:45:43** Are you still with Spark for email?

**01:45:46** Yeah, I was very upset last year with Spark

**01:45:49** because they had just gone through their big new version

**01:45:52** of Spark for the Mac, mostly, which changed a lot of the way

**01:45:58** that they wanted to talk about and handle email.

**01:46:01** You know, like the change from archived to done

**01:46:05** and all that kind of stuff.

**01:46:06** And after another year of using their new system,

**01:46:11** I'm getting used to some of the decisions that they've made

**01:46:14** or have been able to hide away enough of them.

**01:46:17** As you can imagine, they've added AI to the app.

**01:46:21** You know, you wanna have your AI email written for you,

**01:46:26** but a request that I made,

**01:46:28** they made those options able to turn off

**01:46:30** because I just didn't want them,

**01:46:32** but the button was always there.

**01:46:33** And it's like, if I'm not gonna use this,

**01:46:35** I don't need the button to be there.

**01:46:37** And so they added a toggle that if you turn it off,

**01:46:39** it removes the respond with AI button

**01:46:42** from every single email that you were sending.

**01:46:45** And I would say that like,

**01:46:47** now that I've kind of been able to force the app

**01:46:50** back into a relatively sane state,

**01:46:53** like I don't see their inspirational home screen

**01:46:56** and all this kind of stuff,

**01:46:58** like I am benefiting from some of the features

**01:47:01** that they added, like being able to block a sender

**01:47:04** is a great feature.

**01:47:05** I get so much crap email, right?

**01:47:08** And, you know, I get these email newsletters

**01:47:12** that I've been put on that are PR newsletters

**01:47:14** that I can't get away from

**01:47:15** because it is someone just sending me an email,

**01:47:18** but I'm able to block a sender

**01:47:20** and also block every email from that domain.

**01:47:24** Oh, that's nice.

**01:47:26** And it stops me from ever seeing them.

**01:47:28** So that is good.

**01:47:28** It reduces the amount of spam that I get

**01:47:30** and it's across, you know,

**01:47:32** all of my email accounts that I might have.

**01:47:35** This is similar to their automatic sorting that they do

**01:47:38** of email into newsletter or notification categories.

**01:47:42** This is good.

**01:47:43** Like I can categorize them myself as well.

**01:47:46** You know, like if something has been mis-categorized,

**01:47:48** it's easier to change.

**01:47:49** This works well to keep my inbox clean.

**01:47:52** Again, like some of the ways that they did that first

**01:47:54** was kind of frustrating to me.

**01:47:55** Like this categorization moves around

**01:47:58** inside of the chronological list

**01:48:00** based on the most recent email

**01:48:02** added to the category

**01:48:03** rather than living in a fixed place,

**01:48:05** which I initially found very weird.

**01:48:07** But again, after a year of using it,

**01:48:09** I'm now just used to it,

**01:48:10** even though it is weird, as I say it aloud.

**01:48:13** The strange thing about that

**01:48:15** is it actually doesn't reliably match some of these

**01:48:17** between my Mac and my iPhone.

**01:48:19** Sometimes things that are categorized

**01:48:20** as a notification on one device

**01:48:22** might be a newsletter on another device

**01:48:24** because it's not seemingly syncing them

**01:48:26** and it's, I don't know what's happening there.

**01:48:28** But this is again, like kind of the way

**01:48:30** that Spark has always been for me,

**01:48:32** which is like, it's always been a bit janky in its own way,

**01:48:34** but the core features that it has when used well,

**01:48:39** are used well.

**01:48:40** You know, like these two features I mentioned,

**01:48:42** I like them.

**01:48:43** You know, the team sharing is the big thing that I love

**01:48:46** and will continue using forever,

**01:48:48** but it's still strange.

**01:48:49** Like, you know, every update on the Mac

**01:48:51** is 250 megabytes every single time

**01:48:54** because it's an Electron app

**01:48:55** and so you're just re-downloading the app

**01:48:57** every single time,

**01:48:59** which is to me a bananas way to do an update,

**01:49:01** considering they update the app pretty frequently.

**01:49:04** So it's just like 250 megabytes every single time.

**01:49:07** And like the update process,

**01:49:09** every time I open it, the first time it doesn't work,

**01:49:11** I have to quit and reopen it again

**01:49:13** before my inbox will load.

**01:49:14** Like it doesn't remember the size of the window

**01:49:16** from the way it was before.

**01:49:18** Like there's just all these little things.

**01:49:19** They did at least add a sidebar and a column view,

**01:49:22** but I got so used to using it in a smaller view,

**01:49:25** I just kind of use it that way.

**01:49:27** I don't really know what the future of Spark is.

**01:49:29** I'm gonna continue using and paying for it

**01:49:32** for as long as it's around because it is so helpful

**01:49:35** to the way that I deal with my email.

**01:49:37** However, I'm also thinking that maybe just

**01:49:40** a fundamental change to my email

**01:49:42** is just a way to handle it.

**01:49:43** I mean, like as I do less and less and less in sales

**01:49:48** for Relay FM, in fact, I do none.

**01:49:50** And like, I still work with a couple of our long clients,

**01:49:54** but basically every year it's less.

**01:49:58** Maybe I just don't need this feature anymore.

**01:50:01** Like if Spark was to go away tomorrow,

**01:50:04** it would probably just be a case of like,

**01:50:07** I would just not replace it.

**01:50:09** Surely as you were doing less sales,

**01:50:12** you would need the team features more?

**01:50:14** Why is it the reverse?

**01:50:15** Why would I need it more?

**01:50:17** I guess I'm thinking you would need it more

**01:50:18** so that you're still in the loop of what's going on.

**01:50:21** But I don't wanna be in the loop.

**01:50:22** Okay, you're explicitly trying to get out of it.

**01:50:24** I'm getting out of the loop.

**01:50:26** You know, like so at the moment,

**01:50:27** like we're still using it and it still works,

**01:50:29** but like, I guess what would happen is those communications

**01:50:32** would just go back to Slack again

**01:50:34** and we'd lose the context.

**01:50:35** But to be honest,

**01:50:37** Kerry and I have less and less and less conversations

**01:50:39** inside of Spark all the time.

**01:50:41** But Spark overall, I enjoy as an email app

**01:50:44** for the features it has.

**01:50:45** Like there are no good email apps.

**01:50:48** Right.

**01:50:49** This is the one that I use and the one that I'm used to.

**01:50:50** And I get benefit from it

**01:50:52** from the other things that I've mentioned.

**01:50:55** If I was to have to leave,

**01:50:56** I mean, I'd probably just go to mail,

**01:50:58** which is not a good experience.

**01:51:00** Speaking as someone who is still using mail, I agree.

**01:51:03** Cause you know, Spark has snoozing.

**01:51:05** Like, you know, it has like a bunch of stuff in it, right?

**01:51:08** I know that Apple has that remind me thing,

**01:51:10** but I also don't think that that's super great.

**01:51:13** Yeah.

**01:51:14** So I don't really know what the future is for Spark,

**01:51:16** but I'll keep using it forever.

**01:51:17** But I do think at the same time,

**01:51:19** I also just need to change the way that I use email as well.

**01:51:23** So I'm working on that.

**01:51:25** I do also use MimeStream on the Mac

**01:51:27** for my Cortex brand email.

**01:51:29** It's Gmail only.

**01:51:31** This is the best email app around in my opinion.

**01:51:34** It just works very well.

**01:51:36** It's very well made.

**01:51:38** It's very good native feeling application

**01:51:40** with all of the features that you'd want from Gmail

**01:51:43** that at least I've ever wanted to use.

**01:51:45** I really like it.

**01:51:46** It's got tons of settings.

**01:51:47** So you can customize it to work the way you want.

**01:51:49** The problem is it's only Gmail.

**01:51:52** That's such a killer.

**01:51:53** That's such a killer.

**01:51:54** And as well, it's also only on the Mac,

**01:51:56** but I know they're working on an iOS version.

**01:51:59** I've seen them say that they are looking

**01:52:01** at other mail clients,

**01:52:02** but I just don't know how it would work

**01:52:05** because it is so tied into Gmail.

**01:52:08** It uses the Gmail API.

**01:52:10** That's what makes it so different.

**01:52:11** Like it's not using iMap.

**01:52:12** Ooh, yeah.

**01:52:13** I mean, that feels like that makes it impossible

**01:52:16** for them to ever add other clients.

**01:52:17** If they're really in the API,

**01:52:19** you can't mix and match that Gmail API

**01:52:21** with other services.

**01:52:23** It's just such a squirrely unique system.

**01:52:25** But I would love them to make an app for everything

**01:52:27** because it is a very, very good app with a bad name.

**01:52:31** Last year we added kind of team and project management

**01:52:34** to state of the apps.

**01:52:35** And I have been on a journey.

**01:52:38** Oh yeah?

**01:52:39** Well, last year I was using Croft.

**01:52:41** Oh God, right.

**01:52:42** That feels like a thousand years ago now.

**01:52:44** And in the middle I used Obsidian

**01:52:45** and now I'm using Notion.

**01:52:47** Thank you.

**01:52:48** I can't believe we skipped over a whole state of the apps

**01:52:51** and you never made it to using Obsidian on that.

**01:52:53** I can't believe we went from Croft to Obsidian to Notion

**01:52:56** in the course of the year.

**01:52:57** Oh wow, okay.

**01:52:59** That's quite some migration you've been doing

**01:53:01** between those systems.

**01:53:02** Notion is my third attempt at a home

**01:53:05** for Cortex brand information.

**01:53:07** And I listened back to last year's state of the apps.

**01:53:12** And I'm really surprised at how much of a turnaround

**01:53:17** I have had in my feelings about Notion

**01:53:19** over the last 12 months.

**01:53:21** Okay, tell me.

**01:53:22** I said something along the lines of like,

**01:53:23** I could never imagine myself using it.

**01:53:26** Well, it has obviously changed because I use it.

**01:53:29** And the thing that was stopping me is like,

**01:53:32** I didn't like how Notion felt.

**01:53:34** Yes.

**01:53:35** But it is so incredibly powerful.

**01:53:39** And that trumps all.

**01:53:41** It's like the same with Spark, right?

**01:53:43** I don't like the way Spark feels,

**01:53:45** but it's so powerful for me.

**01:53:47** And it's such an important way for me to collaborate

**01:53:51** with people that I will overlook all of it.

**01:53:53** Okay, so when you say power, what does that mean to you?

**01:53:56** Well, at the moment,

**01:53:59** there's a lot of information going in, right?

**01:54:02** And I still feel like at the moment,

**01:54:04** all I am with a lot of the stuff that is in Notion

**01:54:08** is like we took things from Obsidian

**01:54:10** and we put them in Notion, right?

**01:54:13** I do not feel that at the moment,

**01:54:15** I am best using Notion for project management, say.

**01:54:20** So like, you know, if we were working on a new project,

**01:54:23** how do we take that from start to finish?

**01:54:25** I think that we can use Notion very powerfully for this.

**01:54:28** But I'm kind of at the moment,

**01:54:30** building Notion as the information and knowledge database.

**01:54:35** And I want it to become closer

**01:54:37** to our project management tool as well in the future,

**01:54:40** but I'm trying not to force it too much.

**01:54:42** Like right now,

**01:54:43** because it's mostly just me managing production,

**01:54:45** so I'm doing it in a more simple way,

**01:54:47** but I feel like with Notion, I'm building the foundations.

**01:54:50** The way I have seen the power

**01:54:52** is in the way we are doing the Cortex show notes now,

**01:54:56** all in Notion, because this is something brand new, right?

**01:55:00** So like, I haven't had to force something, right?

**01:55:04** Where like right now, if I take the notes

**01:55:06** that I've already previously made,

**01:55:08** say about psychic notepad,

**01:55:09** and then try and force them into a new model

**01:55:12** to fit the Notion project management,

**01:55:15** I just feel like it's more work than is needed.

**01:55:17** Like the project is already running.

**01:55:19** Like I don't need to try and reinvent the wheel of it.

**01:55:24** For our next project from the start,

**01:55:27** I will try and adopt more of the Notion project management

**01:55:30** tools to make that a reality, right?

**01:55:34** And to bring that to life.

**01:55:35** But right now, the thing that I started

**01:55:38** from ground zero with is, first it was,

**01:55:40** let's create a Cortex content calendar.

**01:55:44** Map out the year, map out the episodes,

**01:55:47** move topics around, move promotional items around,

**01:55:51** and really try and get a good flow

**01:55:54** for what the year is going to look like.

**01:55:57** And as I started doing that, I was like,

**01:55:59** maybe we should put topics in here.

**01:56:01** Wait a minute, let's do all of our show notes in here.

**01:56:05** And I think this has been so good for me

**01:56:08** when it comes to planning the show.

**01:56:11** I feel like I have a great place to put ideas

**01:56:13** and then those ideas just stay in the same database

**01:56:17** and they can be moved into different columns

**01:56:19** of in the same database of different months

**01:56:21** and different episodes.

**01:56:23** And then also I can take all this information

**01:56:25** and show it in different views and in different ways

**01:56:28** based on different metadata.

**01:56:30** Like I'm really enjoying this

**01:56:33** and it's opening my eyes to just how much power

**01:56:36** there is in this system for when I want to dig into it

**01:56:39** further for different things.

**01:56:41** So it's also just super good

**01:56:43** and super easy for collaboration.

**01:56:45** You know, like this was the thing I lost

**01:56:47** going from craft to obsidian.

**01:56:50** Right, yeah.

**01:56:51** And then I hired a new assistant,

**01:56:55** we brought more people into the company for design

**01:56:58** and for marketing and I needed to have a system

**01:57:02** where everyone could work on the same documents.

**01:57:05** So Notion is also just like so simple for that

**01:57:08** for the team to manage the projects.

**01:57:10** But I look forward to over the next year

**01:57:13** doing even more to making it like a real

**01:57:17** like start to finish project management tool

**01:57:20** as well as just a team collaboration and knowledge tool

**01:57:24** which is a bit more of,

**01:57:25** but I'm starting to like weave in the Notion-ness of it all

**01:57:29** which I'm excited about.

**01:57:31** Yeah, I think the reason I asked you about the power,

**01:57:33** let me put the podcast show notes aside for a second

**01:57:36** is just,

**01:57:37** Yeah.

**01:57:38** There's this whole world

**01:57:39** of these personal knowledge management systems.

**01:57:42** The pickums.

**01:57:45** Yes, pickums.

**01:57:47** So I think of it, PKMs, the old pickums.

**01:57:50** Pick your pickum.

**01:57:51** I don't know, like I haven't used a ton of these,

**01:57:54** but with Notion and with other things,

**01:57:56** I feel like they do feel very powerful

**01:58:01** when you are in the process of putting things into them,

**01:58:05** but they can often be like a kind of quicksand

**01:58:09** in my experience for getting stuff back out.

**01:58:11** Well, yeah, people get too lost in this, right?

**01:58:14** Which is why I'm not trying to push it too far.

**01:58:16** Yeah.

**01:58:17** Like I'm not trying to push it too far, too fast

**01:58:18** and then everything gets lost.

**01:58:20** I have mixed at best feelings

**01:58:22** about all of these kinds of systems,

**01:58:24** but I mean, I will say,

**01:58:26** I feel like we have discovered a thing here

**01:58:28** with how to do podcast show notes.

**01:58:32** I feel like the Kanban system for podcast show notes

**01:58:36** works surprisingly well.

**01:58:38** I think especially for a show like ours.

**01:58:40** Yeah, where there's more modular topics for sure.

**01:58:42** If there's little sections where you know

**01:58:44** that you're going to talk about something.

**01:58:46** It's one of these rare cases where it feels like

**01:58:48** this is clearly the correct way to do it.

**01:58:50** Like I've gone from kind of skepticism about it

**01:58:52** and like, I don't love it to feeling like,

**01:58:55** no, no, no, this is actually proving its value, right?

**01:58:58** It's becoming more valuable as we use it more.

**01:59:01** And me realizing like, ah, right.

**01:59:04** I have my own weird squirrely show notes

**01:59:07** that I keep sort of separate from everything,

**01:59:10** but realizing like, no, it makes sense even for me

**01:59:13** to like put this stuff in here and like add to this as well.

**01:59:17** So that it's all in a single place.

**01:59:19** And like the value of me having separate things

**01:59:22** is getting gobbled away by like, no, no, no,

**01:59:25** this system is just good.

**01:59:26** And it just makes sense to do this way.

**01:59:28** I kind of imagine a world, right?

**01:59:30** Where I have all of our different products

**01:59:34** and we could have a product or project,

**01:59:38** Kanban board where everything's moving around.

**01:59:42** And I've like rough this out,

**01:59:43** but I've not been very diligent with it.

**01:59:46** We could have things where they are in the process.

**01:59:49** But then also when you click them,

**01:59:51** you also get all of the notes.

**01:59:52** It's kind of like, I imagine this scenario

**01:59:55** in which we have all of the information

**01:59:57** we're ever gonna need, but also a bunch of different ways

**01:59:59** to see where the business is at any one point.

**02:00:02** Yeah.

**02:00:03** That is intriguing to me.

**02:00:04** And I feel like Notion is a tool

**02:00:07** that can be wrangled to make that happen.

**02:00:11** It's just a case of doing the work to make it happen.

**02:00:14** Yeah, I think that's possible.

**02:00:16** And if we're using Notion for the show notes anyway,

**02:00:19** like it 100% makes sense,

**02:00:21** like everything else that's Cortex related

**02:00:23** should go in here for sure, 100%.

**02:00:25** Although for me it worked the other way around,

**02:00:27** but like, cause it was like Cortex brand's in here.

**02:00:30** There's podcast should be in here too.

**02:00:32** Like Mike, the podcast Kanban is the main feature.

**02:00:35** It's like, meanwhile on the sideboard,

**02:00:37** it's like one of 10 things.

**02:00:38** Yeah.

**02:00:40** I feel like if I don't use it for anything

**02:00:42** other than just like it's a place where all of the team

**02:00:44** can see all the information, then it's done its job.

**02:00:47** But I do feel like it has the ability

**02:00:49** to expose information in different places

**02:00:52** and in different ways to help us try and keep track

**02:00:54** of everything we've got going on.

**02:00:57** And it needs someone to do this.

**02:00:59** Like there needs to be a person in charge of managing this

**02:01:02** and like we'll make that work over time.

**02:01:05** But I think this is the one.

**02:01:07** I would be surprised if I was to move away now.

**02:01:09** If anything now, just because of the inertia of it,

**02:01:12** well, we've got like four people in here now.

**02:01:14** So seems very unlikely.

**02:01:17** Speaking of which.

**02:01:18** Yes.

**02:01:20** Last year, Grey Industries Notion

**02:01:23** was the best tool for managing information

**02:01:25** and video production is what you said.

**02:01:27** Did I say video production?

**02:01:28** I don't think I did.

**02:01:29** You said it's the best tool.

**02:01:30** You said it's the best tool.

**02:01:31** I said managing information and video production,

**02:01:34** but I got the sense that fact checking

**02:01:36** was happening inside of Notion.

**02:01:39** OK, so what am I trying to express here?

**02:01:41** I think a conclusion that I've come to with some of these

**02:01:46** as you have dubbed it, which I feel is kind of gross,

**02:01:49** but also kind of perfect as a word to use here.

**02:01:54** I feel like there's some tension in all of these tools,

**02:01:59** which is the tension of like the archive of everything

**02:02:05** is a bad place for also actionable items.

**02:02:10** I just feel like there's something

**02:02:12** about the design requirements for those two things

**02:02:16** or even just like your psychological state

**02:02:18** using a tool like these two things are naturally

**02:02:23** in tension with each other.

**02:02:25** But they also come up against an additional problem,

**02:02:28** which is I kind of always view it as like whatever you're

**02:02:33** doing to organize your life.

**02:02:34** If you're duplicating information anywhere,

**02:02:37** that's a problem.

**02:02:38** Like you should not have any place

**02:02:40** where you've written the same thing twice.

**02:02:44** These tools are trying to solve that problem

**02:02:47** by having these functions where it's like every single line

**02:02:51** of text that you write within the system

**02:02:52** can be accessed by any other part of the system.

**02:02:54** And you can look at all the information

**02:02:56** in all of these different ways.

**02:02:57** So I think they're trying to solve that problem of like,

**02:03:00** you don't need to duplicate information

**02:03:01** because it's accessible from anywhere in all of these ways.

**02:03:06** But that's where I just feel like it comes back

**02:03:08** to this tension for me of tools related to information

**02:03:13** and archive shouldn't be the same tools that

**02:03:15** are related to action.

**02:03:17** So it feels like, again, like a kind of like one, two, three

**02:03:21** impossible Trinity situation.

**02:03:23** Like you can't get all of these things.

**02:03:25** You have to sacrifice information duplication,

**02:03:27** or you have to sacrifice other parts of the system.

**02:03:30** So I think that's why I'm just like fundamentally always

**02:03:33** a little bit grumpy about these tools.

**02:03:36** Now, one of the things that we did last year

**02:03:39** to try to like from my perspective resolve this,

**02:03:44** and also my assistant felt the same way of like,

**02:03:46** okay, Notion is great for us and we still use it

**02:03:48** for like company information, right?

**02:03:50** Where do we keep all of the information about everything?

**02:03:53** So we do still use it for research

**02:03:55** and fact checking kind of stuff,

**02:03:56** but we did decide to try to pull out action items

**02:04:02** into Asana to use for the team.

**02:04:06** And personally, I just absolutely hate this too.

**02:04:11** Oh, okay.

**02:04:13** So here's the thing.

**02:04:15** This is one of these like intangible problems of like,

**02:04:19** there's not really anything wrong with Asana.

**02:04:22** It's totally me.

**02:04:23** I just do not like this application

**02:04:26** for no good reason at all.

**02:04:28** And it comes back to the kind of just feel of things.

**02:04:32** Something about the way information is displayed,

**02:04:34** something about like the way the buttons fill in

**02:04:37** when they click, I just don't like this at all.

**02:04:39** We have a problem with being software nerds.

**02:04:43** We do, we do, 100%.

**02:04:45** It's a problem.

**02:04:45** It's like, I talk about the feel of it.

**02:04:47** It's just like, and as you're saying it,

**02:04:48** I'm like, there is a jankiness sometimes

**02:04:51** that I just can't get my head around.

**02:04:54** But I mean, it is because a lot of these tools

**02:04:56** are using web technologies and da, da, da, da, da, right?

**02:05:00** It's the reason you don't like Trello

**02:05:02** and the same reason I don't like Trello.

**02:05:05** There's nothing really wrong with Trello.

**02:05:07** It works perfectly fine.

**02:05:10** There's no problem.

**02:05:11** But something about the way things move,

**02:05:15** something about the way things, when you click on them,

**02:05:18** it's just off.

**02:05:20** I'm not saying that this is true,

**02:05:22** but it gives a kind of feeling of jury riggedness

**02:05:26** underneath the system.

**02:05:27** Like what is underneath here?

**02:05:29** And again, just to be clear,

**02:05:30** I'm not saying that that is representative

**02:05:32** of the reality of the programming.

**02:05:34** This is just a pure feel thing.

**02:05:37** And Asana just really gave me that.

**02:05:39** Opening up Asana, I feel like,

**02:05:41** and I get this with Notion a little bit, but not as strongly,

**02:05:44** like I'm back working as a teacher in a school,

**02:05:48** like on a joint database with everybody else.

**02:05:51** The system has to sacrifice a lot of niceness

**02:05:55** because it also has to work with 200 teachers

**02:06:00** whose technical skill ranges from expert to idiot.

**02:06:03** I don't think there's a way around it.

**02:06:05** Like even craft, right?

**02:06:07** People say craft is the best one, but it's still janky.

**02:06:10** Yeah, they all have this.

**02:06:12** If you have to have it shared with other people,

**02:06:15** that's where it starts.

**02:06:16** That's where the jankiness starts.

**02:06:17** And I think it is an unavoidable thing.

**02:06:20** Yeah, I do think it is unavoidable,

**02:06:22** but you know what thought has been creeping into my mind?

**02:06:24** Oh, I can't wait.

**02:06:25** Whatever this is I've said.

**02:06:26** While we're recording this podcast.

**02:06:29** All right, I have not thought about it until just what?

**02:06:32** An hour ago when we first started talking

**02:06:34** about to do managers.

**02:06:36** And if my assistant is listening right now,

**02:06:39** she's going to have a cold sweat breakout

**02:06:41** as soon as she hears me say this.

**02:06:43** But I'm thinking, couldn't we just use reminders?

**02:06:47** Wouldn't reminders work for this?

**02:06:49** No.

**02:06:50** Why don't you think reminders could work for this?

**02:06:52** Because doesn't it have the feature now?

**02:06:54** Like you can assign a task to someone, right?

**02:06:56** Like that's a thing you can do in reminders.

**02:06:59** Let me see.

**02:07:00** Yes, I mean, yeah.

**02:07:01** I'm opening up reminders.

**02:07:03** You can do that.

**02:07:04** I mean, this is how me and India

**02:07:05** are managing the house stuff.

**02:07:06** We assign things to each other.

**02:07:08** Honestly, I just reflexively said no

**02:07:11** to be in support and defense of your assistant.

**02:07:14** Right, okay.

**02:07:15** I just don't want you to bring this to her, to be honest.

**02:07:18** Right, so you don't want me to say like,

**02:07:19** oh, hey, I know you spent four months

**02:07:21** moving everything out of notion

**02:07:23** and into a sauna that was actionable,

**02:07:25** but what if you, a Windows user,

**02:07:28** try to move all of that stuff

**02:07:30** onto your Apple phone in reminders?

**02:07:33** No, no, no.

**02:07:34** I mean, she has an iPad, so that would make it easier.

**02:07:37** The reason we use these tools

**02:07:39** is because we need to work with other people.

**02:07:40** Right.

**02:07:41** So that means there is compromise needed.

**02:07:45** I just feel like reminders could work.

**02:07:48** It's the nicest one if I have to share something.

**02:07:50** If she was a Mac user, maybe you could make this work.

**02:07:53** She's not?

**02:07:55** You have to use a cross-platform tool.

**02:07:57** Like, there's just no way around it.

**02:07:59** There's just no way around it.

**02:08:00** You have to just pick your poison.

**02:08:02** Right.

**02:08:03** We're getting into the why can't we just share obsidian

**02:08:06** problem again?

**02:08:07** I don't see that like, it is exactly the second problem.

**02:08:10** It's just like there's just no way around it.

**02:08:13** I genuinely feel, right, so this segment,

**02:08:15** communication and team apps, this is the most pain.

**02:08:19** It is, it's so painful.

**02:08:20** This is the pain segment.

**02:08:22** Because this is the apps we have to use

**02:08:25** because of people we work with,

**02:08:28** which means we can't just choose.

**02:08:31** Like, there has to be a consensus.

**02:08:34** And also, the choice you made whenever you made it

**02:08:37** might have been a good one,

**02:08:39** but eventually you don't want,

**02:08:41** so one of these is Slack, right?

**02:08:43** So Slack is also like the communications.

**02:08:46** Slack is so expensive.

**02:08:48** Yeah.

**02:08:49** But for Relay, there's nothing we can do about it now.

**02:08:52** Right?

**02:08:53** I would prefer to use Discord.

**02:08:54** There's no reason why I couldn't use Discord

**02:08:56** instead of Slack.

**02:08:57** If you were starting Relay today,

**02:08:58** would you use Discord instead?

**02:09:00** Probably.

**02:09:00** Or Teams.

**02:09:02** Hmm.

**02:09:02** Right?

**02:09:03** But like, I wouldn't pay for Slack.

**02:09:05** It's so expensive.

**02:09:07** We have like 40 people or something in our Slack.

**02:09:09** I do think that sometimes.

**02:09:10** I see everybody happily chatting in there

**02:09:12** and I'm like, cha-ching, right?

**02:09:14** Like, look at all that cost.

**02:09:15** Yeah, it's so expensive.

**02:09:16** And it was fine when it was good, right?

**02:09:20** Like, because there are other tools

**02:09:21** which are as good as Slack.

**02:09:24** And so the price of Slack,

**02:09:27** I don't think is worth it anymore for us.

**02:09:30** Right.

**02:09:31** When we could use Teams, which is essentially free

**02:09:33** because who doesn't have Office 365?

**02:09:36** Yeah, yeah.

**02:09:36** Right?

**02:09:37** Or we can use Discord, which, you know,

**02:09:39** to get all of the features,

**02:09:40** you just need like one person to be Nitro.

**02:09:43** Like Slack also just redesigned, right?

**02:09:46** And like the Slack redesign is not terrible,

**02:09:49** but like it doesn't help me.

**02:09:51** And like, I don't even know why they've done it.

**02:09:53** Like, I don't understand the point of the Slack redesign

**02:09:57** when it didn't really seem to do much of benefit.

**02:10:00** And what it's done is like change my muscle memory

**02:10:03** about like where things are.

**02:10:04** Like they had this new view called activity, right?

**02:10:08** But like it doesn't even have all the activity.

**02:10:10** I don't understand why they did this.

**02:10:13** What kills me the worst about this,

**02:10:15** so Slack does this redesign.

**02:10:16** And I discover the fact that they did this

**02:10:18** when I logged into the Cortex Slack

**02:10:20** to message you something.

**02:10:21** I went, what the hell happened, right?

**02:10:24** It's a rollout.

**02:10:25** All slacks will get this, but they're rolling it out.

**02:10:27** But so I was like, oh, okay,

**02:10:29** the app must have updated or whatever.

**02:10:32** And then I switch over to the gray industries one

**02:10:34** and I go, oh no.

**02:10:36** Like my gray industries Slack is still the old design.

**02:10:40** And this is like weeks now.

**02:10:43** I switch between these two.

**02:10:45** They're doing a very slow rollout of this

**02:10:48** and they've been changing it.

**02:10:49** I will give it to them.

**02:10:51** Like they have made changes, which have made it better

**02:10:55** because they're listening to what people have to say.

**02:10:57** I would just say, I don't really know why you did it.

**02:11:00** Like, there just isn't really enough different.

**02:11:04** Like the activity view is an interesting idea, right?

**02:11:07** And the idea is like, you've got so many channels, right?

**02:11:10** We're just gonna put it all into one.

**02:11:12** But like, I don't really feel like

**02:11:13** it's pulling everything in.

**02:11:16** Like I would like to say, show me all the activity

**02:11:19** for a certain subset of channels that I choose.

**02:11:21** Every message, put them all in there.

**02:11:24** But they don't.

**02:11:24** It's just like, did someone at you

**02:11:26** or did someone give you a reaction?

**02:11:28** Like that is interesting stuff,

**02:11:31** but that's still not enough for me.

**02:11:34** And like, I do not need to see drafts

**02:11:37** as prominently as you show me them on the iPhone.

**02:11:40** There's like a massive section on the iPhone app.

**02:11:44** And I also don't like this later, whatever that means.

**02:11:47** I don't use that, but it's like right there

**02:11:49** and I can't get rid of it.

**02:11:50** And it's just like.

**02:11:51** Okay, so I completely agree.

**02:11:53** Like you should be able to customize this stuff up top.

**02:11:56** Let me slightly defend Slack before I complain again.

**02:11:58** They rolled out this later feature.

**02:12:01** And for me, this was the feature where it's like, okay,

**02:12:04** I have finally made peace with Slack.

**02:12:07** Of all of the tools that we're discussing

**02:12:10** in this uncomfortable corporate section

**02:12:13** of the state of the apps.

**02:12:16** Slack is the one I'm happiest with.

**02:12:18** And it's because they added this later feature

**02:12:20** where now when anyone messages you

**02:12:23** or like any message that you see,

**02:12:24** even if you're not part of it,

**02:12:26** there's a little bookmark you can click.

**02:12:28** And that says save for later.

**02:12:29** And then it shows up in that little later thing

**02:12:31** on the top of the screen.

**02:12:32** Maybe I should use this.

**02:12:33** Yeah, so for me, this solved the problem

**02:12:36** I was complaining about for years with Slack

**02:12:39** of it's too easy to lose stuff.

**02:12:42** Like you just go look in a channel

**02:12:44** and like everything gets marked as red

**02:12:46** and you just like, you miss it, right?

**02:12:47** Oh, you know what?

**02:12:48** This is actually kind of nice.

**02:12:49** It's great.

**02:12:50** This is kind of nice.

**02:12:51** You can complete them.

**02:12:52** Yeah, so it basically acts as a kind of pseudo to-do list

**02:12:58** for every message in the whole system.

**02:13:00** So you can just like bookmark this thing.

**02:13:03** And then when you've taken care of it, you hit complete.

**02:13:07** I think this is also partly why like

**02:13:08** I'm a little bit grumpier about Asana in some ways

**02:13:11** is because like, well, like my assistant messages me

**02:13:14** with stuff that needs to get done.

**02:13:15** And it's kind of easier to just bookmark it for later

**02:13:20** and then like mark it as completed within Slack

**02:13:22** and never have to go out to this secondary system.

**02:13:25** I would like it to do more to highlight

**02:13:27** that I have things in there rather than just a number,

**02:13:30** like maybe color it.

**02:13:31** I mean, yeah, something like that could happen.

**02:13:33** Maybe they can take that into account for the redesign.

**02:13:36** The ongoing redesign.

**02:13:37** Yeah, so like I'm a big fan of the later feature.

**02:13:39** And I do feel like I am at peace now with Slack.

**02:13:42** This is the team communication tool.

**02:13:45** I don't lose things anymore.

**02:13:47** Great, I don't need to switch to anything.

**02:13:49** And just as I felt content, like, ah, thank you later,

**02:13:53** comes this rollout.

**02:13:54** And look, listen, guys, at Slack, if you're gonna do this,

**02:13:59** if you're gonna have a slow rollout, for the love of God,

**02:14:03** roll it out by users, not by Slack.

**02:14:07** It is wild that I like, I'm in like four slacks.

**02:14:11** Two of them have been updated, two of them haven't.

**02:14:13** It's a very strange feeling.

**02:14:15** It's crazy, it's like the core of your product

**02:14:18** is that people can have multiple slacks

**02:14:22** for the different teams and companies

**02:14:24** and whatever that they're involved in.

**02:14:27** Don't have a slow redesign rollout

**02:14:31** when you know you must hit a huge portion of the users

**02:14:34** living halfway in both worlds.

**02:14:37** It's maddening.

**02:14:38** The thing that is the most surprising to me

**02:14:40** is that they would make any big change

**02:14:43** and would not do the one thing that makes sense,

**02:14:46** which is let me have one overview of all of them.

**02:14:51** Yeah.

**02:14:52** Now I understand the logistical problems of that.

**02:14:56** I understand the security problems of that.

**02:15:00** But if I don't have a heightened,

**02:15:03** like corporate security level thing in a Slack,

**02:15:06** which is obviously like if I'm not enterprise,

**02:15:09** let me choose.

**02:15:10** And the fact that I don't have one dashboard,

**02:15:13** here's all of the messages you've received today.

**02:15:16** I can't believe that they have not found a way

**02:15:18** to make that work.

**02:15:20** That is absolutely wild to me.

**02:15:23** They have done such a big change.

**02:15:25** But I would imagine so many users of Slack

**02:15:28** would love to not have to keep going one to the other,

**02:15:32** to the other, to the other, to the other all day,

**02:15:36** which is how I spend my life.

**02:15:37** I only get to avoid that because I'm in just three slacks.

**02:15:41** So two of them that I'm in a work, two of them are social.

**02:15:44** So the two that are social, I don't do this to.

**02:15:46** But going between Relay and Cortex brand,

**02:15:49** I don't want to keep doing that all the time.

**02:15:51** Just show me in one view all the messages

**02:15:55** I need to deal with in both places.

**02:15:58** I don't know why I don't do it.

**02:16:00** I have a quick question for you.

**02:16:02** Where does the save for later exist?

**02:16:04** Oh, it's in the left.

**02:16:07** But it doesn't have a little thing on the Mac version

**02:16:09** to tell you the stuff in there.

**02:16:10** Oh my God.

**02:16:14** On this redesign, are you kidding me Slack?

**02:16:18** They don't put an indicator to show you

**02:16:21** you have things in the later.

**02:16:24** On the iPhone it does.

**02:16:26** Damn it.

**02:16:26** On the iPhone, it says later, one item.

**02:16:30** But on the Mac version, it just says later.

**02:16:34** Okay, so on the Mac, when I save things for later,

**02:16:36** like I do all the time,

**02:16:39** it doesn't actually tell me how many things are in later.

**02:16:42** It's just an icon.

**02:16:43** It's another place to manually check and look.

**02:16:46** Oh, do I have things saved?

**02:16:48** Great.

**02:16:49** Okay, cool.

**02:16:49** So now I know I'm not gonna use that feature then.

**02:16:52** I'm gonna go back to doing what I was doing before,

**02:16:54** which is just marking things as unread.

**02:16:57** Great.

**02:16:58** I didn't notice this terrible design flaw

**02:17:01** in the new design because my gray industry Slack

**02:17:03** is still on the old design where it says later, three.

**02:17:07** So I know that I have three to-do items in my Slack,

**02:17:10** but on the Cortex brand one,

**02:17:12** I cannot freaking believe this.

**02:17:13** There's no way to see.

**02:17:15** Oh, do I have something that I saved in later?

**02:17:17** I don't know.

**02:17:18** Let me go manually check and see if something is there.

**02:17:23** Oh.

**02:17:23** Just another place to hover over.

**02:17:25** So now I know.

**02:17:26** Keep things as unread.

**02:17:28** Oh.

**02:17:30** They're just all hell.

**02:17:32** I can't believe this.

**02:17:33** I can't believe, after I'm like, oh Slack,

**02:17:34** I finally made peace.

**02:17:36** Like, hmm, have you though?

**02:17:40** We now enter the Obsidian Hour

**02:17:42** as we talk about writing apps.

**02:17:44** No, this is not the Obsidian Hour.

**02:17:45** Are you using a different writing app now then?

**02:17:47** Well, no, I'm still using Obsidian.

**02:17:49** I just feel like I actually don't have a ton to say

**02:17:53** about Obsidian compared to last year.

**02:17:56** This is again a place where I'm really happy with this app.

**02:18:00** I feel like it just lines up with my brain

**02:18:02** in the way that I want to be writing

**02:18:05** and the way that I want to use text,

**02:18:07** being able to like flip back and forth

**02:18:08** between files super fast

**02:18:10** or have like the way they do multiple windows on the screen.

**02:18:13** The only part of this,

**02:18:15** which is still kind of killing me,

**02:18:17** is related to our communication and teams app

**02:18:23** is the question about collaboration with Obsidian.

**02:18:27** There's no question.

**02:18:29** What do you mean there's no question?

**02:18:30** Because it's not possible.

**02:18:32** Like, there isn't a question, right?

**02:18:34** But you can force it, right?

**02:18:37** How much do you want to force it?

**02:18:39** How much do you want to take, I don't know,

**02:18:41** the most mission critical app that I use

**02:18:45** and force it to do something that it doesn't want to do?

**02:18:48** That's the question.

**02:18:49** That seems like a really good question.

**02:18:51** It does.

**02:18:52** Does any sense of like, is collaboration

**02:18:55** any kind of concern for Obsidian?

**02:18:58** Actually, it's funny you asked that.

**02:19:00** I don't know.

**02:19:01** I don't even know if they publish a roadmap or anything.

**02:19:03** They have a roadmap.

**02:19:04** Do they?

**02:19:05** I just wondered, like, yeah,

**02:19:06** because I wondered if you kept up to date with that,

**02:19:08** but like they do have a public roadmap.

**02:19:10** I just know this from them being around for a while.

**02:19:13** Like I remember when the iPhone app was on the roadmap

**02:19:16** and people were excited about that back in the day.

**02:19:19** I will ask you, are you looking for this?

**02:19:20** What do you think of the new Obsidian icon?

**02:19:22** The logo.

**02:19:23** I think it's fine.

**02:19:24** I like it.

**02:19:25** I probably slightly preferred the old one.

**02:19:28** They went the reverse direction, right?

**02:19:30** It seems like every company on earth takes their logo

**02:19:32** and every couple of years they like scratch their chin

**02:19:35** and they go, could we make it less?

**02:19:39** Could we make it simpler?

**02:19:41** Could we make it less identifiable?

**02:19:44** That is why I like it.

**02:19:45** I think they added personality to it.

**02:19:48** That's what I like about it.

**02:19:49** They made it look more like a rock.

**02:19:51** Yeah, yeah, and Obsidian did the reverse.

**02:19:53** They took their abstracted notion of a rock and said,

**02:19:55** but what if it was more rocky?

**02:19:57** What if it looked like an actual rock?

**02:19:59** And they didn't make it yellow, green, blue, and orange.

**02:20:02** They were looking blue and red, you know?

**02:20:05** Ah, yes.

**02:20:05** They just kept it purple.

**02:20:06** The corporate colors that everything becomes.

**02:20:10** I mean, like quickly looking on the public roadmap

**02:20:13** that they have, I'm not surprised to see

**02:20:14** that there's nothing about collaboration.

**02:20:17** I'm not surprised because I do just feel like

**02:20:21** the architecture of Obsidian is just fundamentally opposed

**02:20:25** to the notion that multiple people are working

**02:20:28** in one of these databases.

**02:20:29** Like I think Obsidian fairly does fall

**02:20:32** into the pick-em category as a tool,

**02:20:35** but it is clearly the most you as an individual

**02:20:40** have had your brain explode into a thousand text files.

**02:20:44** And that is what this program is for.

**02:20:46** Yeah, I mean, just the reason that I consider it

**02:20:49** to be a possibility is it is built on web technologies

**02:20:52** the same way as these other apps that we're talking about.

**02:20:55** So like I have no doubt that it would be complicated,

**02:20:57** but even if they added just like,

**02:20:59** this is the collaboration area,

**02:21:03** that all of the notes in here, you can collaborate,

**02:21:06** but not all of your notes, you know what I mean?

**02:21:08** Yeah, no, I completely agree.

**02:21:10** It's a different business, right?

**02:21:11** Which might not be why I want to do it,

**02:21:12** but it's interesting.

**02:21:14** Yeah, so the fundamental trade-off right now

**02:21:16** is that you can use their sync tool,

**02:21:19** and that will allow you to sync across all of your devices,

**02:21:22** including phone and iPad,

**02:21:24** or you can use Dropbox to sync.

**02:21:27** And if you do that, you have to give up sync on the phone

**02:21:31** and on the iPad, but with Dropbox,

**02:21:35** you can just share a folder or a subfolder

**02:21:38** with another Dropbox user,

**02:21:40** and then they can have access to just the files

**02:21:43** that you put in that folder.

**02:21:45** It says right here, shared vaults,

**02:21:49** collaborate with your team,

**02:21:51** invite your team to a shared obsidian vault,

**02:21:54** notes are updated in real time across your team's devices

**02:21:57** without compromising the privacy of your company data.

**02:22:00** How is that not what you're looking for?

**02:22:02** God damn, Mike, you're dragging me into the details.

**02:22:04** Okay, right, so this is what I'm saying.

**02:22:05** There is a thing where multiple people

**02:22:08** can work on a single vault, right?

**02:22:10** But this is what I'm saying about the structure of the app.

**02:22:15** You lose a huge number of advantages

**02:22:19** of the way this app is designed

**02:22:22** the moment you have to break up information

**02:22:24** across multiple vaults.

**02:22:26** Like I cannot stress enough,

**02:22:28** this is a huge sacrifice in functionality.

**02:22:32** Everything about this app screams.

**02:22:35** You wanna keep everything that you're working on

**02:22:37** in one spot.

**02:22:39** Right, but if, why don't you just give all of the notes

**02:22:42** to the sync system?

**02:22:44** I could give all of the notes to the sync system,

**02:22:47** but then that also means the entire database

**02:22:50** has to be shared with my assistant.

**02:22:52** It's an all or nothing deal.

**02:22:55** For you, why is that a problem?

**02:22:56** It's a problem for me because I don't want to share

**02:23:00** all of the notes with my assistant.

**02:23:01** Like some of this stuff is just private

**02:23:04** and I'd rather not have it be shared.

**02:23:06** But even there, there's a thing of like,

**02:23:09** this is just a mission critical

**02:23:11** and also I also cannot emphasize enough,

**02:23:14** super squirrely system.

**02:23:16** The moment it has to be like the two of us

**02:23:19** need to use this thing that I use for writing,

**02:23:22** like you said here, like it immediately causes compromises

**02:23:25** of like, oh, okay, I have to arrange the files

**02:23:28** in a different way if this other person

**02:23:30** is ever going to find anything in here.

**02:23:33** And again, the big advantage is

**02:23:36** I don't need to arrange anything.

**02:23:37** Like I can just search for anything

**02:23:38** using my brain to remember what it is

**02:23:40** that I was trying to find.

**02:23:42** But like forcing my obsidian vault

**02:23:45** on another person is just inhumane.

**02:23:49** So I would want to just share a portion

**02:23:51** where I can be like, look, here's a very small amount

**02:23:54** of the actual active stuff.

**02:23:56** And this is what you can have access to.

**02:23:59** And I'm really not trying to be annoying here.

**02:24:01** No, no, no, no, no, it's fine.

**02:24:02** Why not create a second vault?

**02:24:04** No, no.

**02:24:06** That is shared.

**02:24:07** And when you're ready to share something,

**02:24:09** move the file to the shared vault.

**02:24:12** Like once something's ready to be shared,

**02:24:15** does it need the context of the other notes

**02:24:18** that are related to it?

**02:24:19** You're not wrong in that like,

**02:24:21** this seems like it's a reasonable thing.

**02:24:23** But the reason why you need to keep stuff in one vault

**02:24:27** is that in obsidian, you get these benefits

**02:24:30** from linking stuff together.

**02:24:32** And what happens is you can break the cross links

**02:24:37** if you change something in another document,

**02:24:42** which the document you have temporarily moved

**02:24:45** out of the sync system references.

**02:24:48** So it basically causes this problem

**02:24:51** of the moment you pull something out,

**02:24:53** you now have to be careful, right?

**02:24:56** You have to be careful and make sure

**02:24:59** while this document is with my assistant,

**02:25:01** I have to make sure that I don't accidentally modify

**02:25:05** anything else in this system that references that document

**02:25:09** because then things can get broken.

**02:25:11** So this is the problem of like,

**02:25:14** yes, you could pull something out,

**02:25:17** but it just, it raises the possibility of danger.

**02:25:21** Ideally, what you would like to exist is

**02:25:25** it's all the same vault, but you have like a folder

**02:25:29** that you can share.

**02:25:31** You just move things to the folder,

**02:25:33** but it means that nothing's gonna break.

**02:25:35** It's the same note and you should move it back.

**02:25:37** But if you moved it to a different vault,

**02:25:40** now it's like it has no context of where it came from.

**02:25:43** And when it comes back, it's like it's a new baby boy

**02:25:46** in there, right?

**02:25:47** Like it doesn't know anything about anything.

**02:25:49** It's brand new.

**02:25:50** Yeah, and also the problem is like, while it's gone,

**02:25:54** obsidian will act as though that missing note

**02:25:57** still exists within the system.

**02:25:59** Like you can end up with like,

**02:26:01** oh, I've just created a blank version of this document.

**02:26:04** Right?

**02:26:05** Like this is the kind of like weird problems that can happen.

**02:26:07** It's gonna create a blank file with that name

**02:26:10** just because other things reference it.

**02:26:12** And then when it comes back,

**02:26:13** now you've got two files with the same name.

**02:26:15** Yeah, I can see that it becomes a bit of a mess.

**02:26:18** This is the kind of problem, right?

**02:26:19** It's like obsidian, this is a great feature.

**02:26:23** Obsidian treats things that have not yet been created

**02:26:27** as though they exist.

**02:26:29** And so that's why if you pull something out of the system,

**02:26:32** it goes from this document exists

**02:26:35** to this kind of like ghost document

**02:26:37** that is waiting to pop into existence

**02:26:40** the moment you touch it, right?

**02:26:41** And it's like, oh, okay, great.

**02:26:43** Now you write into your problem where it's like,

**02:26:45** now you've lost the history of this document

**02:26:47** if you ever wanna go back

**02:26:48** and try to like track where a change happens.

**02:26:50** So like there's just like lots of complications with this.

**02:26:53** So I'm currently using Dropbox to sync my obsidian stuff,

**02:26:57** which means I don't have it on my iPad

**02:26:59** and I don't have it on my phone,

**02:27:00** which is mostly a minor annoyance,

**02:27:03** but it does mean like I'm very aware of

**02:27:08** because it doesn't exist on those devices,

**02:27:10** I'm also not plugging in like getting information

**02:27:14** into obsidian through things like shortcuts

**02:27:17** in ways that I otherwise would say like,

**02:27:20** hey, append this information to this file.

**02:27:23** And that's the thing that is like

**02:27:25** becoming increasingly irritating.

**02:27:27** And I think I probably will just eventually move.

**02:27:31** So I've worked myself into a situation

**02:27:33** where I'm not really using either of the two things

**02:27:37** that I wanna use.

**02:27:38** I'm not really using the collaboration

**02:27:40** with my assistant in Dropbox

**02:27:42** because I keep thinking like,

**02:27:43** oh, I'm gonna move this over into the sync system,

**02:27:45** but I don't.

**02:27:46** So I don't also just start setting up shortcuts and things

**02:27:50** to make a bunch of my obsidian life easier, so.

**02:27:53** Yeah, I think no matter what happens,

**02:27:54** you should move to obsidian saying

**02:27:56** you can just take the benefit of that

**02:27:58** and then try and find some other way

**02:28:00** to deal with the collaboration.

**02:28:01** Although I think realistically,

**02:28:03** you just need to give up on the idea

**02:28:05** of collaborating in obsidian,

**02:28:07** but you should try and see if there is like using obsidian

**02:28:11** sync and collaboration tools.

**02:28:13** Maybe there's some kind of thing

**02:28:14** that we're not thinking about,

**02:28:16** but I think other than that,

**02:28:17** you should just give up on the idea.

**02:28:19** This is one of these things.

**02:28:20** Clearly the direction over time is

**02:28:22** I should just be using obsidian's sync system.

**02:28:25** And I'm just dragging my feet on it for a bunch of reasons.

**02:28:28** Yeah, I'm sure there's other features that you're missing

**02:28:31** that would otherwise be cool that they put into their system

**02:28:33** because that's what they want you to use.

**02:28:35** Yeah, and also I just think you have the benefit of,

**02:28:39** I would rather use the sync system that was custom designed

**02:28:42** exactly for this tool than using Dropbox,

**02:28:45** which this is sitting on top of.

**02:28:47** But again, this is relatively speaking within obsidian,

**02:28:52** a fairly minor problem in the scope of the benefit

**02:28:57** that this app provides me.

**02:28:58** So like I have, the overall picture is I have nothing

**02:29:02** but thumbs up to give to obsidian.

**02:29:04** Like I just really love it.

**02:29:07** And after years of trying to find what is the writing app

**02:29:11** that works best for me, this is the answer.

**02:29:14** It is obsidian.

**02:29:15** A very 2023 thing for writing would be to use some kind of AI

**02:29:23** I will say it is for me.

**02:29:25** What are you using it for?

**02:29:26** One of the things that I have to write,

**02:29:28** which I find to be one of the more difficult things

**02:29:31** that I need to write is the description for this show.

**02:29:37** Oh, really?

**02:29:38** For a long time, it followed a format,

**02:29:40** which was great as this, Mike does this, they both do this.

**02:29:43** This is like hundreds of episodes,

**02:29:44** like over a hundred episodes did this.

**02:29:47** I wanted to change that this year

**02:29:49** to actually make the descriptions

**02:29:51** be a little more fuller, to give people an idea

**02:29:55** of what the episodes were about.

**02:29:57** Also to make it easier when going through

**02:29:59** previous episodes to find it.

**02:30:02** I haven't gone back and done this.

**02:30:03** I might at some point like actually go back

**02:30:05** and fill them out a bit more, but I don't know about that.

**02:30:10** But I decided to change it up.

**02:30:13** Cause like we made changes to the show this year.

**02:30:14** We do like the special episodes and stuff like that.

**02:30:16** And so I thought this might be a time to change stuff up

**02:30:20** and I've done it.

**02:30:20** So what I'm doing is writing more descriptive,

**02:30:25** basically longer descriptions for the episodes.

**02:30:28** So they just talk about more of the things

**02:30:30** that we talk about, rather than just limiting it to three.

**02:30:35** I don't really like this kind of writing in general,

**02:30:38** like just like short sentences, short paragraphs.

**02:30:41** That is not how I write.

**02:30:42** Like I write in long sentences, long paragraphs.

**02:30:47** If I ever do write.

**02:30:48** And I also find it complicated to try and get all of the

**02:30:53** right punctuation for this kind of writing.

**02:30:56** So what I do now is I write a verbose, poor grammar

**02:31:04** version of the description and I go to chat GPT

**02:31:07** and I'm like, can you rewrite this for me?

**02:31:10** And it does.

**02:31:11** And that's what I use.

**02:31:12** I was just thinking when you mentioned the old episodes,

**02:31:15** I was wondering if you could do something like,

**02:31:17** here's a transcript of the episode,

**02:31:19** write a summary of it.

**02:31:21** Maybe, to be honest, the way if I was ever gonna do

**02:31:25** something like that, I could use the chapters.

**02:31:28** Oh yeah, yeah, that'd be good.

**02:31:30** They're the topics really.

**02:31:32** So like it would just be a case of being like,

**02:31:34** we spoke about this, this, this, this, and this,

**02:31:36** write me a description.

**02:31:37** Right, and that might be slightly easier for a chat GPT

**02:31:40** to ingest than a totally insane,

**02:31:44** not speaker marked out transcription of the podcast.

**02:31:47** Also, I don't like the chat GPT voice the way that it writes.

**02:31:51** So I like to give it my writing first.

**02:31:56** So like, if I feel like I have found better success,

**02:31:58** if I give it bullet points,

**02:32:00** I tend not to like what it gives me.

**02:32:02** If I have written a bad description and give it that,

**02:32:06** I think it does a better job of matching the tone

**02:32:08** that I want.

**02:32:10** And so giving it a transcript,

**02:32:11** I don't know what nonsense it would throw out at me.

**02:32:14** Yeah, that kind of writing feels like the good sort of thing

**02:32:16** to use chat GPT for.

**02:32:18** It's funny you mentioned how you hid the AI thing in Spark

**02:32:20** because using mail for me,

**02:32:23** this is like the number one place that I want a button

**02:32:25** that says write a first draft of an email response.

**02:32:29** Well, I mean, you don't like,

**02:32:31** I want to deal with my email if I'm going to deal with it,

**02:32:33** you know, but you don't.

**02:32:35** This is for me, like, what's the actual problem

**02:32:37** that I'm trying to solve?

**02:32:38** It's not that I would send that email,

**02:32:40** but it's just a hundred million times easier to be like,

**02:32:44** okay, let me tweak this to be more

**02:32:46** of what I'm actually trying to do.

**02:32:48** Obviously, I can just like copy and paste stuff out

**02:32:50** into chat GPT and be like, right, me neither.

**02:32:52** Oh, great.

**02:32:53** Honestly, you should check out Spark

**02:32:54** because like it's what it does.

**02:32:55** They do AI drafts.

**02:32:58** You know what?

**02:32:59** That's a great idea.

**02:33:00** I am going to check out Spark.

**02:33:01** I think, I don't know why I had mentally written it up.

**02:33:04** I think whenever you talk about it,

**02:33:05** I think in my head, I put it under the category

**02:33:08** of our section of pain on communication and corporate tools.

**02:33:12** It is for me.

**02:33:13** It is for me.

**02:33:14** But like, you know, as we said, all of these apps

**02:33:17** that causes pain do have useful features

**02:33:19** until you find out that they changed the usual feature

**02:33:21** that you liked and then it wasn't useful anymore.

**02:33:23** Yeah.

**02:33:24** Okay.

**02:33:25** I think, you know what?

**02:33:26** I will check out Spark.

**02:33:27** Give it a go.

**02:33:27** Like if you genuinely want that, it does it.

**02:33:28** Yeah.

**02:33:30** So yeah, I feel like for that kind of serviceable

**02:33:35** kind of writing, you just need a thing that's descriptive.

**02:33:39** Chat GPT is good at that.

**02:33:41** This has been a year of AI for sure.

**02:33:44** People ask me all the time if I use Chat GPT

**02:33:47** to help with the writing.

**02:33:48** They're like, oh, hey, couldn't this help with the writing?

**02:33:50** Wouldn't this speed things up?

**02:33:51** And in my experience, it's terrible at what I would want it

**02:33:59** to do, like, hey, write something interesting

**02:34:01** about this topic.

**02:34:02** It's just the worst.

**02:34:03** Like I hate it.

**02:34:04** I hate it so much.

**02:34:05** It's not interesting when I was trying it out

**02:34:09** and had it work on things that I like know the topic area.

**02:34:12** It just gives you all of the common misconceptions

**02:34:16** about a thing.

**02:34:16** It's terrible at this.

**02:34:18** I can't imagine there is a world

**02:34:21** in which you would feel comfortable using it.

**02:34:25** Yeah.

**02:34:26** Because you are so focused on facts, right?

**02:34:30** Like, could you trust it?

**02:34:32** No, I couldn't.

**02:34:33** I also just think its style is terrible.

**02:34:37** Chat GPT, this is going to sound weird,

**02:34:39** has a terrible sense of humor.

**02:34:41** It's just not funny.

**02:34:44** Everything that it tries to do that's funny

**02:34:46** is in the range of dad joke territory or like jokes

**02:34:52** for children.

**02:34:53** It's just awful.

**02:34:55** I haven't found Chat GPT useful for that in the slightest,

**02:34:58** although much to my horror, I know full well

**02:35:02** that there are plenty of YouTube channels

**02:35:03** already that just ask Chat GPT for scripts on topics

**02:35:07** and then give that to a voice generator

**02:35:09** and just give that next phase to a video production thing

**02:35:13** and slap up tons of videos.

**02:35:16** Here we are.

**02:35:17** Those videos are all terrible, but it's already begun.

**02:35:21** Yeah, but whatever.

**02:35:23** People have been making low effort content on YouTube

**02:35:25** for a really, really long time.

**02:35:27** It doesn't matter how much of it there is.

**02:35:29** Good stuff will still be wanted by people.

**02:35:31** That's how I feel about it.

**02:35:32** Yeah, I do think there's a slight difference here just

**02:35:34** in that it can fool more people.

**02:35:36** It's like it's slowly raising the bar on this.

**02:35:38** But anyway, for the time being, it's

**02:35:40** not a remotely useful tool for me for writing.

**02:35:43** With one key exception, which is where I do actually

**02:35:48** use Chat GPT a lot when I'm working on a script,

**02:35:52** and it is that Chat GPT is the world's best thesaurus.

**02:35:57** It is insanely good at thesaurus-ing.

**02:36:02** When people use any kind of AI system,

**02:36:04** the thing I'm always trying to tell them

**02:36:06** is look, the value is not in your initial question.

**02:36:10** The value is in your follow up questions.

**02:36:14** And so when I write scripts, I used to just 100% of the time,

**02:36:19** I always had the Apple thesaurus app just open on my computer.

**02:36:23** And I would be looking for words like,

**02:36:25** I'm looking for a word like this.

**02:36:26** What options does it have?

**02:36:27** I used that for years.

**02:36:29** But now the thing that's so amazing with Chat GPT

**02:36:31** is I'm looking for words that are similar to this word,

**02:36:36** and that spits out a bunch of words.

**02:36:38** But the real power is being able to say, OK,

**02:36:43** but I want something that has a more positive valence to it,

**02:36:47** or I want something that has a more negative sound to it.

**02:36:50** And that's where it's just like, god damn,

**02:36:53** is it so good at being like, what about these words?

**02:36:56** Or being able to skip the things that thesauruses do,

**02:36:59** where they're often giving you much more than you want,

**02:37:02** so you can specify like, I want a different word for this,

**02:37:05** but this exact meaning, right?

**02:37:08** Not all of the meanings of this word,

**02:37:10** just like this narrow way in which it's used.

**02:37:13** What are other ways that you could say that?

**02:37:15** And so boy, boy has it just like taken my thesaurizing

**02:37:20** to next levels.

**02:37:21** Like this is by far and away the most

**02:37:25** frequent and common use of chat GPT for me by far.

**02:37:30** I think next most common use for me,

**02:37:32** because chat GPT basically is an app, right?

**02:37:34** It is on my iPhone.

**02:37:35** Yeah, it's on my iPhone.

**02:37:37** Next most useful thing for me is tech problem debugging.

**02:37:42** So in my life, I am the person that everyone I know

**02:37:46** asks for technical assistance to fix whatever

**02:37:50** it is in their life, right?

**02:37:51** My computer isn't working.

**02:37:52** Like it's not doing this thing, help me fix it.

**02:37:55** If you're the tech support person in your world,

**02:37:59** you know that very frequently,

**02:38:02** the hard part of the problem is not fixing the problem.

**02:38:08** The hard part of the problem is understanding

**02:38:12** what the problem is based on the description

**02:38:16** that the non-technical person is giving you.

**02:38:19** It's very frequently like with my wife,

**02:38:22** who in our house it's like,

**02:38:24** I will take care of all of the technical problems

**02:38:26** because she has no patience for dealing with any of it.

**02:38:29** And frequently I will be handed an iPad with the sentence,

**02:38:34** it's not working.

**02:38:36** Like, okay, right?

**02:38:37** Like let's start trying to drill down, what is the it?

**02:38:40** What should it be doing?

**02:38:42** What should it not be doing?

**02:38:43** And you try to turn those descriptions

**02:38:44** into like actionable things.

**02:38:46** This is a totally sensible problem, right?

**02:38:48** Because it's unreasonable to expect average users

**02:38:53** to know the names of all of the things.

**02:38:56** What's the name of the strip on the top of your computer,

**02:38:58** right?

**02:38:59** What are all these different things?

**02:39:00** Nobody knows.

**02:39:01** What has been absolutely magical for me now

**02:39:05** using chat GPT to try to solve my problems

**02:39:09** is realizing I can do to chat GPT

**02:39:13** what everybody else does to me,

**02:39:16** which is basically give it a very badly phrased description

**02:39:20** of the problem and trust that it can work it out.

**02:39:24** And here is my pro tip on this, right?

**02:39:27** This is a total life changer for me.

**02:39:28** Wait, just work at, you use chat GPT for this, not Bing.

**02:39:31** So they're both the same systems behind the scenes.

**02:39:33** I know, I'm just wondering what app you're using.

**02:39:35** I'm just, that's not important, I'm just intrigued.

**02:39:38** It depends.

**02:39:38** The actual chat GPT app is often my first go

**02:39:42** even for solving technical problems.

**02:39:43** Like it's surprisingly good.

**02:39:45** Bing is still like optimized for searching for things

**02:39:48** which is not always really what I'm trying to do.

**02:39:50** I think whatever version of chat GPT they have

**02:39:52** in the actual app feels smarter to me

**02:39:56** than the Bing version does.

**02:39:57** The Bing is like optimized in a particular way.

**02:40:00** I just opened the chat GPT app

**02:40:01** and I now have the chat with voice setting

**02:40:03** which I've not tried yet, but they just gave me that.

**02:40:07** Okay, yeah, so here's my pro tip.

**02:40:09** They've rolled out this chat with voice thing.

**02:40:10** I think you should do something else.

**02:40:12** So this is what I have done.

**02:40:14** I am just using Apple dictation to record what I'm saying

**02:40:19** and turn it into a blob of text and send it to chat GPT.

**02:40:23** And if you do it that way,

**02:40:24** chat GPT doesn't talk back to you.

**02:40:28** It just types back and you can read.

**02:40:30** So I think for most people,

**02:40:32** you will be able to read and skim

**02:40:35** and frankly get through a lot of like chat GPT's boilerplate

**02:40:39** nonsense of like, well, as a large language model,

**02:40:41** I have some thoughts about the iOS subsystem.

**02:40:43** It's like, shut up, right?

**02:40:45** But I will tell you like,

**02:40:46** it has been such an amazing game changer

**02:40:49** to be able to just like speak out loud.

**02:40:53** In sentences, I would never type,

**02:40:56** sort of change what you're saying in the middle,

**02:40:58** not have any of the technical words right

**02:41:00** about like what problem it is

**02:41:02** you're trying to solve on the computer

**02:41:03** and just hit return and chat GPT can freaking nail it

**02:41:08** like 99% of the time.

**02:41:10** It understands not what you have said,

**02:41:14** but what you are trying to say.

**02:41:17** It's amazing.

**02:41:18** And it's also to me, it was like,

**02:41:19** oh wow, I can be much lazier in the way

**02:41:22** that I talk to this thing

**02:41:23** because I can trust that it gets it,

**02:41:26** which made me instantly realize,

**02:41:29** oh, I have encouraged this behavior in everyone I know

**02:41:33** in my whole life because they're all like,

**02:41:35** I can just say whatever to him

**02:41:37** and I can trust the whole game.

**02:41:38** You're the language model.

**02:41:40** I like the thought of like in the future,

**02:41:42** someone goes, Gray, I have a technical problem.

**02:41:44** You just get your phone out and hold it up to them.

**02:41:47** Go on.

**02:41:48** You speak to chat GPT.

**02:41:50** Let's take me out of the middle.

**02:41:52** Yeah, it has really been quite a unique experience

**02:41:56** to have this feeling of I understand

**02:41:59** how everyone uses me in their lives

**02:42:02** because I now have this thing for me.

**02:42:05** Chat GPT debugged this problem on my computer

**02:42:09** that was like absolutely shocking to me

**02:42:11** that like went straight down

**02:42:12** into the absolute core of my computer

**02:42:15** where there was a problem with like a Python installation.

**02:42:18** This again is where I don't know the technical word.

**02:42:20** It's like, oh, there's different shells

**02:42:23** that you can use at the terminal,

**02:42:25** which is always the level where I'm like,

**02:42:26** I don't know why this is a thing that exists,

**02:42:29** but it's like, oh, ages ago,

**02:42:32** when I set up a Mac and you used to be able

**02:42:34** to dual boot them into Linux,

**02:42:35** like I caused a problem with my Python installation

**02:42:39** that has been following me for forever.

**02:42:42** And when I was trying to run some Python scripts,

**02:42:45** like I couldn't get them to run

**02:42:46** and I could not figure out why.

**02:42:48** And it's like chat GPT debugged and walked me through

**02:42:52** this just insane series of terminal commands

**02:42:56** to fix like the deepest subsystem on my computer.

**02:43:00** No one on earth could have debugged this in this way

**02:43:03** from my description.

**02:43:04** I am trying to change my relationship to these tools.

**02:43:07** It is inevitable what is happening to the world.

**02:43:09** I'm not gonna dig my feet in on this forever.

**02:43:12** I have concerns and they continue,

**02:43:14** but I'm not gonna be like a Luddite.

**02:43:16** I'm not gonna be like, no, I refuse to use these tools.

**02:43:20** I will use them and I will find the ways to use them

**02:43:22** that I think are right, like for me,

**02:43:25** but just because I've had feelings and thoughts

**02:43:28** and they're complicated about this stuff,

**02:43:29** I'm not gonna be like, well, now I'm just gonna refuse

**02:43:31** to do it.

**02:43:33** No, of course.

**02:43:33** And that's what I'm trying to figure out

**02:43:34** is where is this actually useful?

**02:43:37** And that's sort of what this conversation was for me

**02:43:39** is what seems like it might be the most useful at first.

**02:43:43** Oh, it's useful for script writing

**02:43:44** has not remotely been useful at all,

**02:43:47** but there are totally other ways

**02:43:49** in which it has been very useful.

**02:43:51** I mean, especially like I cannot convey to you

**02:43:56** how much chat GPT has sped up my ability

**02:44:00** to work on spreadsheets.

**02:44:02** The amount of complicated and crazy things

**02:44:05** that I have done in addition to just the raw amount

**02:44:08** of work that I have gotten,

**02:44:10** being able to ask chat GPT questions

**02:44:12** or just some specifics of formulating formulas,

**02:44:17** it's like a 20 to 50 fold productivity increase

**02:44:21** like in the domain of spreadsheet work.

**02:44:24** It's insane.

**02:44:25** I've seen these spreadsheets, they're bananas.

**02:44:27** There's thousands and thousands of rows

**02:44:31** and I don't understand what's going on in there.

**02:44:33** But I guess now you said that kind of makes sense

**02:44:35** that chat GPT is helping you do it, right?

**02:44:36** Cause it's very complicated stuff.

**02:44:38** With the spreadsheets, there's nothing that it's helped me

**02:44:40** with that I couldn't do on my own.

**02:44:42** It's just cutting down the time enormously,

**02:44:46** which is the same thing as a productivity boost.

**02:44:49** It's insane.

**02:44:50** So it's very interesting that like these two areas,

**02:44:54** being a thesaurus and also being able to produce

**02:44:59** technical answers that I am able to verify are correct,

**02:45:05** that I don't have to trust is what the thing said true.

**02:45:09** No, no, I can see if it worked.

**02:45:12** And so that is also where it's just been

**02:45:14** an absolutely huge advantage.

**02:45:17** I will just say it's made me think a lot about

**02:45:20** the future of Apple's apps,

**02:45:22** because I don't know if this is true,

**02:45:25** but I have a suspicion and a feeling that Apple might be

**02:45:29** more culturally resistant to AI than other companies.

**02:45:34** I just think like they absolutely have to be incorporating

**02:45:39** some AI tools into their production apps,

**02:45:43** like Final Cut Pro and Logic,

**02:45:46** and they have to be doing it right freaking now,

**02:45:50** or I think they're gonna be in real trouble very soon.

**02:45:53** I think they are.

**02:45:54** I do.

**02:45:55** I understand the thinking behind the cultural resistance.

**02:45:59** I think I felt that at first too,

**02:46:00** but I don't think that stupid.

**02:46:02** I mean, they just put a transformer model in the keyboard.

**02:46:06** To me, that was a sign.

**02:46:08** I hope you're right.

**02:46:09** My hesitation is like,

**02:46:10** there are two big apps that I use, Final Cut Pro and Logic,

**02:46:14** have both had obvious places where you could use

**02:46:18** even just the basics of machine learning for like five years,

**02:46:22** and they haven't put in any of that.

**02:46:24** Like it's insane to me that in Final Cut Pro,

**02:46:27** the workflow is still in theory that you need to

**02:46:30** manually tag all of your clips with what's in them.

**02:46:35** And like, guys, this should have been solved

**02:46:38** half a decade ago.

**02:46:40** Yeah, yeah, that's a good point.

**02:46:41** Or similarly with Logic,

**02:46:42** like a bunch of modern audio editing apps are doing things

**02:46:46** where it's like, they'll just write the transcription

**02:46:48** of what you've said above the audio,

**02:46:50** which makes it a hundred million times easier to edit.

**02:46:52** Logic could have done that years ago, but they haven't.

**02:46:55** Yeah, but Logic's a bad example though.

**02:46:58** Why do you say that?

**02:46:59** Well, Logic is not a podcast editing or audio editing.

**02:47:02** It's music, it's a music creation tool.

**02:47:03** I would say the Final Cut example, that is weird.

**02:47:06** Like they should add something like that.

**02:47:08** But I know you have used Descript

**02:47:11** and we were talking about it offline a while ago.

**02:47:14** And that's one of the apps that does that thing

**02:47:16** that you're talking about.

**02:47:17** But like Descript is a podcast editing tool.

**02:47:21** Logic is not that, it's just what we use it for.

**02:47:23** Yeah, I know.

**02:47:24** I still think even if you're doing music,

**02:47:26** you're moving the play head around constantly.

**02:47:28** Being able to see where does a word start

**02:47:31** and where does a word end is still something

**02:47:33** a music editor would want to do.

**02:47:35** I don't think that's limited to podcast editing, but.

**02:47:39** Anyway, yeah, so it's a little sidebar on AI,

**02:47:41** which is sort of an app.

**02:47:46** Maybe next year we might have a lot more AI-based apps

**02:47:49** on our list than we do right now.

**02:47:51** There'll probably be a category.

**02:47:53** Even if that even makes sense,

**02:47:54** it won't even make any sense anymore.

**02:47:56** It might be there in every single app that we're using.

**02:47:58** I mean, honestly, AI is an ocean.

**02:48:01** I mean, I already said AI is in Spark.

**02:48:03** I mean, there's probably multiple other apps that it's in.

**02:48:05** Yeah, you know what, actually,

**02:48:06** now that I think about it,

**02:48:08** with the speed of AI, we may push through it so fast

**02:48:12** that it would be like highlighting apps

**02:48:14** that can do calculations.

**02:48:16** Like no, they all do calculations.

**02:48:18** You don't need to highlight this as a feature.

**02:48:20** It's actually, yes.

**02:48:22** I don't think we will have an AI category next year.

**02:48:24** I think this might be the only time

**02:48:26** we ever do a sidebar on AI apps.

**02:48:28** But I think next year,

**02:48:31** more and more of the apps that we use

**02:48:33** will have AI and machine learning features,

**02:48:35** and we'll be talking about them more.

**02:48:37** That's what I reckon will happen.

**02:48:39** Okay, Mike, we gotta start wrapping up this show here, okay?

**02:48:43** Let's go, let's go.

**02:48:44** Go, media apps and entertainment.

**02:48:46** What do you wanna talk about?

**02:48:48** All I have is games.

**02:48:49** Okay, great, me too, go.

**02:48:51** The only one that's on a smartphone

**02:48:54** is an app called Finity, which is on Apple Arcade.

**02:48:57** It's just a very good match three app.

**02:49:00** I love it.

**02:49:01** It's hard to explain, but if you have Apple Arcade,

**02:49:04** download this app, it's fantastic.

**02:49:06** Oh, okay.

**02:49:07** And then I'm gonna talk about my two games

**02:49:09** of the year so far.

**02:49:10** Legends of Zelda, Tears of the Kingdom.

**02:49:12** They did it.

**02:49:13** How could it be possible to make a better game

**02:49:16** than in my opinion, the best game ever made?

**02:49:19** Just make it better.

**02:49:20** It's what they did.

**02:49:21** Tears of the Kingdom is a better game

**02:49:23** than Breath of the Wild in every way

**02:49:25** you could measure in my opinion,

**02:49:27** which is truly outstanding that they pulled it off,

**02:49:31** but they pulled it off.

**02:49:32** It is superb.

**02:49:34** A game that I have recently started playing,

**02:49:36** which is currently, as of today,

**02:49:39** when we were recording on October the 12th,

**02:49:41** the only game that seems to be in true contention

**02:49:45** for game of the year other than Tears of the Kingdom

**02:49:47** is Baldur's Gate 3.

**02:49:49** It's like I've literally never heard of this game.

**02:49:51** It is essentially what's called a CRPG,

**02:49:54** which means computer role-playing game,

**02:49:56** which means Dungeons and Dragons-style rules

**02:50:00** in a video game.

**02:50:01** Is that using AI to do that?

**02:50:02** How do they do that?

**02:50:03** It's been in development for a really, really,

**02:50:05** really, really long time.

**02:50:07** So they have, you know,

**02:50:09** apparently there are like thousands of ways

**02:50:11** the game can end like the pause that you can take

**02:50:14** because you can do things like you can attempt to do a thing

**02:50:16** and you roll a dice and it fails

**02:50:18** and now this character dies, right?

**02:50:20** It's just like, well, there's nothing you can do about that.

**02:50:21** The character's dead now, right?

**02:50:23** Like it's really fun and really weird and really cool.

**02:50:27** It's got all of the RPG mechanics you might want from a game,

**02:50:30** but it adds dice in and it's turn-based combat

**02:50:32** with dice throw-in and like the spells.

**02:50:34** It's Dungeons and Dragons, but a video game.

**02:50:36** It's really cool and it's very inventive

**02:50:39** and you can feel the hard, long work

**02:50:43** that went into this game.

**02:50:45** The story's really interesting.

**02:50:46** Like I'm enjoying it.

**02:50:48** I'm like, I don't know, 10 hours in or something.

**02:50:50** It's very hard.

**02:50:51** It's very good.

**02:50:52** I like it a lot.

**02:50:53** Okay, I want to bring attention to three games

**02:50:56** for my own selfish reasons

**02:50:57** because I want to promote more things like this.

**02:51:00** The first game is called Isle of Arrows.

**02:51:03** If you've listened to this section in the past,

**02:51:04** you will know I'm a big fan of the tower defense genre

**02:51:07** and I feel like this is an anemic genre

**02:51:10** that could always use more attention

**02:51:12** and people doing interesting things.

**02:51:14** You've chosen a recent one this time, which is great.

**02:51:17** And I'm familiar with this game

**02:51:20** because it was very popular and like,

**02:51:21** I'm very well reviewed when it came out last year.

**02:51:24** Yeah, I missed it the first time around

**02:51:26** and I think this is one of these things

**02:51:28** where I, something about when I saw it,

**02:51:30** I was like, ah, I don't think that's for me,

**02:51:32** but I just wanted to mention it

**02:51:33** because it does interesting things

**02:51:36** in the tower defense genre

**02:51:38** and might be kind of newbie friendly

**02:51:40** if someone hasn't gotten into that before.

**02:51:43** It's dangerously close in some ways to a puzzle game,

**02:51:47** but not so close that I don't want to play that

**02:51:50** because I hate puzzle games.

**02:51:51** So anyway, I just think it's really interesting.

**02:51:53** I like to promote tower defense games

**02:51:55** that do different kinds of stuff.

**02:51:57** Along the similar lines,

**02:51:59** I stumbled upon Vampire Survivors a while back

**02:52:01** and that game has since given birth to a genre

**02:52:05** that people are calling bullet heaven,

**02:52:08** as in the opposite of bullet hell, which I really like.

**02:52:10** Oh, I haven't heard that phrase

**02:52:12** because I remember when it was called reverse bullet hell,

**02:52:14** but I prefer bullet heaven.

**02:52:16** Right, we were trying to struggle with

**02:52:18** how do you describe what this game is

**02:52:20** because it's the opposite of a bullet hell.

**02:52:22** And so yeah, we're like reverse bullet heaven.

**02:52:25** It's like, it's not good.

**02:52:26** So people have created the phrase bullet heaven,

**02:52:29** which is like perfect.

**02:52:30** That's so good.

**02:52:31** You are the object that emanates all of the weapons

**02:52:35** and there's a million enemies around you.

**02:52:37** Since Vampire Survivor,

**02:52:38** a bunch of games have come out in this category.

**02:52:42** I just wanted to draw attention to Army of Ruin,

**02:52:45** which is a game made by a seemingly very small team

**02:52:49** that it's really high quality.

**02:52:52** And I think it just had super unfortunate timing

**02:52:55** when it came out between a couple of other games like this,

**02:52:59** but I really like it.

**02:53:00** It's very visually pleasing.

**02:53:02** Again, very interesting weapon mechanics,

**02:53:05** a very interesting upgrade system that I like

**02:53:07** that doesn't feel like it locks you into a particular build.

**02:53:12** Unlike a lot of these things,

**02:53:13** I really feel like you have the freedom

**02:53:15** to try different stuff.

**02:53:17** So I'm gonna recommend Army of Ruin.

**02:53:19** This has also just been a terrible year

**02:53:21** to be an indie game developer

**02:53:24** because there are so many good big games

**02:53:28** coming out this year

**02:53:29** that trying to get attention in 2023

**02:53:32** seems to have been a bit of a nightmare.

**02:53:34** Yeah, so when I was looking around for Army of Ruin stuff,

**02:53:37** I was like, oh, the number of reviews they have

**02:53:40** and the size of their subreddit

**02:53:41** do not reflect how good this game is.

**02:53:45** So yeah, I really like this one.

**02:53:46** If you like Vampire Survivors, totally give this one a try.

**02:53:49** Then I will, because I do.

**02:53:51** Yeah, it's cute.

**02:53:53** I think it's a cuter version of this.

**02:53:55** It looks really nice.

**02:53:57** This has been the real go-to for my Steam Deck

**02:54:01** playing on the couch.

**02:54:02** I've been very much enjoying it.

**02:54:03** The thing about Vampire Survivors,

**02:54:05** the one thing it does not have is looks.

**02:54:07** I find Vampire Survivors has a certain kind of

**02:54:10** retro pixel charm.

**02:54:12** I think it's the best version of this.

**02:54:14** But yeah, sometimes I could feel like,

**02:54:16** ah, I just want something

**02:54:18** a little bit more aesthetically pleasing.

**02:54:19** Do you know Vampire Survivors on the iPhone now?

**02:54:22** I don't know how you'd play that on the iPhone,

**02:54:23** but I don't know how people play anything on the iPhone.

**02:54:26** Fair enough, but it is.

**02:54:28** The last and increasing scale of cuteness

**02:54:31** is a game called Voxel Tycoon.

**02:54:33** This is like a sort of semi-early access game.

**02:54:38** There's a game called OpenTTD,

**02:54:41** which is like a town train simulator kind of game

**02:54:44** that is a billion years old.

**02:54:46** And I have felt for like a decade,

**02:54:49** I'm trying to find the modern replacement for that game.

**02:54:53** And Voxel Tycoon is this.

**02:54:56** It's the kind of thing where you're just connecting up towns

**02:55:01** with trains and trucks and buses,

**02:55:03** and you're moving passengers around,

**02:55:05** you're delivering coal from the mine to the factory,

**02:55:09** and then that factory is producing iron bars

**02:55:11** that you're delivering somewhere else.

**02:55:13** The furniture company needs wood,

**02:55:15** so it's your job for like how to transport that stuff around.

**02:55:18** I find this just so satisfying and so relaxing.

**02:55:23** There's been a lot of games that try to do this,

**02:55:28** but I feel like Voxel Tycoon is hitting the version of this,

**02:55:31** which is in my dreams of, again, very cute little towns,

**02:55:36** sort of interesting mechanics,

**02:55:38** but not too crazily complicated.

**02:55:41** I just really like it.

**02:55:42** I wanted to just draw attention to it as a game

**02:55:44** that I feel could totally use more players

**02:55:47** supporting it in development.

**02:55:49** There's also a delightful feature

**02:55:50** where after you've built all your trains,

**02:55:52** you can click on a train

**02:55:54** and then have the first-person view of driving around

**02:55:58** on all the little tracks and going through the forest

**02:56:00** or going through the mines or whatever.

**02:56:02** It's delightful.

**02:56:03** That to me feels like,

**02:56:04** what do you benefit from making a game like this today?

**02:56:08** Yes, exactly. That's what it is.

**02:56:09** Like, ah, but we can zoom the camera down

**02:56:12** so that you can see what the bus driver in your tiny town sees.

**02:56:15** So really love it.

**02:56:17** That does remind me of like theme park world

**02:56:19** when I was a kid where you could ride the roller coaster,

**02:56:23** but it was super janky, but you could do it.

**02:56:26** And it's like, ah, I'm riding my roller coaster.

**02:56:28** It's going way too fast.

**02:56:30** Yeah, so those are my three game recommendations from the year.

**02:56:33** This episode is brought to you by Sidekick Notepad

**02:56:36** from Cortex Brand.

**02:56:37** Sidekick Notepad has been designed to be your companion

**02:56:40** for taking notes while getting your most productive work done.

**02:56:44** It is ready to be with you all day

**02:57:10** and gives you an ideal space to keep track

**02:57:12** of what you're working on and who you're working with

**02:57:14** without distracting you of notifications

**02:57:16** or incoming messages.

**02:57:18** We worked incredibly hard to engineer a construction

**02:57:21** that would provide rigidity and comfort

**02:57:23** so you'll look professional when carrying and using it.

**02:57:26** Sidekick Notepad has a minimal and beautiful cover,

**02:57:43** a tool to help you with what you're working on.

**02:57:45** Then when you're done, just tear off the page

**02:57:47** and start fresh.

**02:57:49** In your daily life, you deserve space to think

**02:57:52** and to brainstorm, to write down your ideas

**02:57:53** and to iterate on them.

**02:57:55** Pen and paper does this better than anything else.

**02:57:57** Sidekick Notepad is the in-between part

**02:58:00** from your brain to your computer.

**02:58:02** Oh, and speaking of pens,

**02:58:04** why not check out the Cortex brand Mark 1 pen,

**02:58:07** available in two colors with the very best refill we found.

**02:58:11** It features perfectly balanced aluminium construction

**02:58:25** The cover material is made from recycled coffee cups

**02:58:28** using a highly specialized process.

**02:58:31** These cups would have otherwise be destined for landfill

**02:58:33** but we use them here in this product.

**02:58:51** Sidekick Notepad will be there throughout the day.

**02:58:54** Then tomorrow, tear off the page and start again.

**02:58:57** Sidekick Notepad is available now at cortexbrand.com.

**02:59:02** That is cortexbrand.com.

**02:59:06** All right, onto lightning rounds

**02:59:08** and we've really gotta speed up now.

**02:59:11** It is the lightning round,

**02:59:12** so it should in theory be the fast round.

**02:59:14** I will start with Raycast.

**02:59:16** It is my new launcher on the Mac.

**02:59:18** It's replaced Alfred for me.

**02:59:20** Oh wow, okay.

**02:59:21** It's got a very nice, simple, modern UI

**02:59:23** and it has tons of integrations available.

**02:59:26** I don't use a ton of them, but they're there

**02:59:28** and I add more in over time

**02:59:30** for different services and stuff like that.

**02:59:32** And I like that you can do things like if you want to,

**02:59:35** window management tools and punch and conversion stuff.

**02:59:37** It's just, I like Raycast a lot.

**02:59:39** It's nice and simple

**02:59:41** but can be complicated if you want it to be.

**02:59:43** Alfred's the one that I use.

**02:59:44** I'll check that out.

**02:59:45** All right, little app on the app store

**02:59:47** called Wallet Creator.

**02:59:49** I think a long forgotten feature of Apple Wallet

**02:59:53** is that you can with apps help

**02:59:56** get your own custom passes into Apple Wallet.

**03:00:00** So in the UK, there's a gym membership company

**03:00:03** that is extremely annoying

**03:00:05** because they want you to open up their app

**03:00:06** in order to get access to the gyms.

**03:00:09** I was like, hey, we'll generate a QR code for you

**03:00:12** in our app.

**03:00:13** Like we want you to open.

**03:00:14** I'm like, oh, I hate this so much.

**03:00:16** Wallet Creator is a little app

**03:00:17** that if you have anything that is annoying like that,

**03:00:20** you can just take a barcode or a QR code

**03:00:23** and create your own card in Apple Wallet

**03:00:27** which you can then also proximity lock to a location

**03:00:32** to just automatically show up on the lock screen.

**03:00:34** So that's so good.

**03:00:36** Yes, so I've done this with my library card

**03:00:39** and I've done this with my gym pass.

**03:00:42** I love eliminating something

**03:00:44** that is just a constant pointless frustration.

**03:00:46** And if you have some company

**03:00:48** that just doesn't want to integrate with Apple Wallet,

**03:00:50** you can probably force them to with Wallet Creator.

**03:00:53** I'm gonna recommend a Mac app called Drop Zone.

**03:00:56** It's a menu bar app that you can configure

**03:00:59** with different shortcuts that you would like for,

**03:01:02** if you drag a file up to the menu bar app,

**03:01:05** where do you want it to go?

**03:01:07** So I'll give you two examples.

**03:01:09** One, I have a folder in Dropbox

**03:01:12** that the receipt management app

**03:01:15** that I use for my like business receipts can pull from.

**03:01:19** So I can take a PDF from my Mac,

**03:01:21** drag it over the Drop Zone icon

**03:01:23** and drop it into the receipts folder and it's gone.

**03:01:26** And I don't need to actually do any management.

**03:01:28** The other one that I love even more though

**03:01:29** is trying to air drop a file on the Mac

**03:01:32** is way more complicated than it should be.

**03:01:34** Like you have to like find the share menu

**03:01:37** and click a bunch of buttons.

**03:01:38** With this, I can just drag a file to Drop Zone,

**03:01:41** drop it over the AirDrop area

**03:01:43** and it just opens the AirDrop menu

**03:01:44** and I can choose who to send it to.

**03:01:46** But you can have it also do a bunch of actions.

**03:01:48** You can drag a bunch of files up and it, look, you zip them.

**03:01:51** You have one of these apps,

**03:01:52** you can do a bunch of things with it.

**03:01:53** I really like it.

**03:01:54** It's a small little Mac app.

**03:01:55** Okay, next up I've got Home Pass.

**03:01:57** This is an app I wish I had known about three years ago,

**03:02:02** but it's like, when's the best time

**03:02:03** to plant a tree a hundred years ago?

**03:02:06** When's the second best time now, right?

**03:02:09** When's the best time to start using Home Pass five years ago?

**03:02:12** When's the second best time now?

**03:02:15** This is the app that will keep track of all of those codes

**03:02:18** for everything in your house that you're trying to automate.

**03:02:21** We're like, hey, hold this accessory

**03:02:23** up to the iPhone or whatever.

**03:02:24** And you think, oh great, I'll just do this once

**03:02:27** and surely I will never need to repair

**03:02:30** or reset this home accessory again.

**03:02:33** Now you 100% will.

**03:02:35** And it can be extremely annoying

**03:02:38** to try to either find the code that you've lost

**03:02:41** or like yank a home accessory out of an awkward location

**03:02:45** to reset it up.

**03:02:46** Home Pass is the thing of like,

**03:02:47** every time you add something to your house,

**03:02:50** add its HomeKit code into Home Pass first.

**03:02:55** And then you can just use that app to reset up

**03:02:59** or repair any of these applications

**03:03:01** if they get messed up later.

**03:03:03** So start using it today if you don't already use it.

**03:03:07** That's a very good recommendation.

**03:03:08** Why are you laughing so hard?

**03:03:09** Because I gave it to you last year in the...

**03:03:12** Did you?

**03:03:13** Yes, this came from me in the lightning round last year.

**03:03:14** I don't think you did.

**03:03:15** I don't remember this.

**03:03:16** Great, you just gave the same pitch I gave 12 months ago.

**03:03:19** Well, you know what?

**03:03:20** I didn't listen.

**03:03:21** It's worth remembering.

**03:03:22** I didn't listen to you at all.

**03:03:25** Where did you find it then?

**03:03:27** Rosemary Orchard recommended it on Automators,

**03:03:30** a sister show on Relay.

**03:03:31** Unbelievable.

**03:03:32** Which is also totally worth the ride.

**03:03:34** Here's the thing, Mike, when she said it,

**03:03:35** it just sounded so obvious.

**03:03:36** I was like, oh, I should totally go use that app.

**03:03:38** But last year you were like, that's a great app.

**03:03:41** Nevermind.

**03:03:44** PopClip.

**03:03:45** Essentially what this app does

**03:03:46** is when you select text on the Mac,

**03:03:49** it pops up the copy paste menu from iOS essentially.

**03:03:52** So you can, which I like, you know,

**03:03:54** you're selecting text, I'm gonna do it in my mouse.

**03:03:55** Now I could just go up and press copy

**03:03:57** rather than doing the keyboard thing.

**03:03:58** But what PopClip can also do

**03:04:00** is let you do things with the text.

**03:04:03** So for example, if you highlight a link,

**03:04:05** it will pop up something where you can click that link.

**03:04:08** But what I use it for the most

**03:04:10** is if I want to title case something,

**03:04:13** I can highlight it and press this little button

**03:04:15** and it will turn that text into title case text.

**03:04:18** Very cool.

**03:04:19** And again, like Dropzone,

**03:04:20** there's tons of things you can do with it.

**03:04:23** The developer has a bunch of different extensions

**03:04:24** that you can use.

**03:04:25** Okay, so listen, this next one,

**03:04:27** I know that you did recommend me

**03:04:29** and I specifically put it in here

**03:04:31** because I wanted to reemphasize something.

**03:04:34** So last year you mentioned CleanShot X

**03:04:37** and you were like,

**03:04:38** if anybody takes screenshots, you need this application.

**03:04:41** Unlike some other apps,

**03:04:42** I distinctly remember listening to you and thinking,

**03:04:45** I take screenshots, but I don't need this app.

**03:04:48** What could I possibly want to do with my screenshots

**03:04:52** more than what I already do with them

**03:04:53** is just have an image on my desktop?

**03:04:55** Well, you know what?

**03:04:56** I should have listened to Mike.

**03:04:58** Hashtag Mike was right.

**03:04:59** CleanShot X, if you ever take a screenshot on your Mac,

**03:05:03** it's just better.

**03:05:04** I'm so glad I actually installed it.

**03:05:06** And the really nice thing is the ability to do stuff like

**03:05:10** get an image into your clipboard

**03:05:12** without it ever actually existing as a file anywhere

**03:05:16** on your computer to delete later.

**03:05:18** Like that is one of the main features

**03:05:20** I really like about this.

**03:05:21** Super easy markup tools.

**03:05:23** I did not believe Mike last year.

**03:05:25** I thought I didn't need it, but I was wrong.

**03:05:28** It's great.

**03:05:29** Screen recording, you can do videos, you can do GIFs,

**03:05:32** you can do scrolling capture of a webpage,

**03:05:35** you can use it to select an area that has text

**03:05:40** and have it capture the text and no screenshot.

**03:05:43** Yeah, it's crazy.

**03:05:44** So good.

**03:05:45** I'm gonna recommend Lasso.

**03:05:48** So I use Moom as my window manager

**03:05:50** for keyboard shortcut stuff,

**03:05:51** but what Lasso lets me do

**03:05:54** is with a different keyboard shortcut,

**03:05:56** it will pop up a little icon

**03:05:58** and I can draw an area on my screen

**03:06:00** for where I want the current selected window

**03:06:03** to exactly be and how big I want it to be.

**03:06:06** Sold.

**03:06:07** Yeah, so for Moom, what I use it for is like specific sets

**03:06:11** and you can do this in Lasso too,

**03:06:13** but I like the way I have it set up in Moom and it's fine.

**03:06:15** But Lasso will let you like,

**03:06:18** you can choose a grid size in the app settings

**03:06:20** of how much of like how many grid sections

**03:06:23** do you want the screen to be divided into

**03:06:25** and it will let you just draw in those.

**03:06:27** It's really, really cool.

**03:06:28** I love it.

**03:06:29** You see live how big the window is gonna be

**03:06:31** and then when you like unclick the cursor,

**03:06:34** there you go, done.

**03:06:36** Because you've just mentioned that,

**03:06:37** I'm going to mention I've been looking for a replacement

**03:06:39** for my window management system on the Mac

**03:06:42** and I've eventually settled on Mosaic as the app

**03:06:46** to move around windows into different exact spots.

**03:06:50** I was using Divi last year,

**03:06:51** but it is like very old and needed to be replaced

**03:06:54** and I quite like Mosaic.

**03:06:56** It lets you draw like a super teeny tiny grid

**03:06:58** so you can really exactly specify

**03:07:01** exactly where you want a window to go

**03:07:02** when you hit the keyboard shortcut.

**03:07:04** But the one thing it doesn't do is have that

**03:07:07** you can live draw exactly where you want

**03:07:10** the window thing to go.

**03:07:11** So I'm gonna add Lasso to Mosaic

**03:07:13** as my Mac window management.

**03:07:15** Flighty, we talk about Flighty a lot,

**03:07:17** but Flighty has had a very busy year

**03:07:19** and I wanna make sure I mention it.

**03:07:21** Obviously the live activities are amazing.

**03:07:23** I mentioned that before,

**03:07:24** but Flighty has added two features

**03:07:26** that has made it even better,

**03:07:27** friends flights.

**03:07:29** So they've had a way for a number of time

**03:07:31** where you can take a flight

**03:07:33** and you can add it to their section as a friends flight

**03:07:36** and it doesn't count in your statistics

**03:07:37** and all that kind of stuff

**03:07:38** and you can also limit the amount of notifications

**03:07:40** you want for a friends flight.

**03:07:42** They've made this feature better.

**03:07:44** So you can share with someone

**03:07:46** to have your flights added into their Flighty.

**03:07:48** So me and Stephen have done this.

**03:07:49** So whenever he's flying,

**03:07:51** or whenever I'm flying,

**03:07:53** the other one gets notifications about it.

**03:07:55** Oh nice, I didn't realize that was a thing

**03:07:56** that you could do.

**03:07:57** So it's pretty new,

**03:07:58** but the biggest thing for me

**03:07:59** is they finally made a watch app.

**03:08:01** Oh, I'm so glad.

**03:08:03** I cannot believe they didn't do before now,

**03:08:05** but they finally added an app.

**03:08:06** So on the Apple watch,

**03:08:08** you can see the information about your flights

**03:08:10** and it also comes with a bunch

**03:08:11** of really great complications as well.

**03:08:13** Yeah, I was always so baffled

**03:08:14** that it didn't exist as a complication on the watch.

**03:08:17** Every time I was like, why is this not here?

**03:08:18** This seems like the best place for it to be.

**03:08:20** So very happy that that exists there.

**03:08:23** I'm gonna add an app called Gemini on your phone.

**03:08:26** This is partly a recommendation for the future as well.

**03:08:29** Gemini is an app,

**03:08:30** it's existed for a long time

**03:08:31** to get rid of duplicate photos in your photo library.

**03:08:35** But I'm mentioning this here now

**03:08:36** because they're currently running a test flight

**03:08:39** that you can join for the next version of Gemini.

**03:08:42** And it is amazing.

**03:08:45** So I think like just about everybody ends up

**03:08:47** with a million duplicate photos

**03:08:49** and also very similar photos.

**03:08:52** And this is just the best app I've ever found

**03:08:55** for I wanna try to trim down the size

**03:08:59** of my iPhoto library and get rid

**03:09:02** of like these thousand similar photographs that I have.

**03:09:05** The new version that's coming out

**03:09:06** adds just a ton of nice features,

**03:09:09** fixes some of the irritations with the old version

**03:09:12** that like sinks state across all of your devices.

**03:09:15** So you can mark like,

**03:09:17** oh, I never wanna get rid of this photo.

**03:09:19** So if I try to clear up my library on another device,

**03:09:22** it knows to just say like these are the photos

**03:09:24** that you wanna keep.

**03:09:26** Really great for me, it's a kind of perfect couch app

**03:09:29** for like, I just wanna do something

**03:09:31** while I'm half watching this TV show.

**03:09:33** Let me try to like clear up my library, Gemini.

**03:09:35** Bartender 5, so it's a brand new version of Bartender,

**03:09:38** which is an app that lets you clean up your menu bar.

**03:09:41** And so you can have more menu bar apps

**03:09:44** available to you at a click.

**03:09:46** Now it's got a few new features.

**03:09:48** One, it lets you customize the visual style

**03:09:51** of your menu bar.

**03:09:52** You can actually change its shape and color

**03:09:53** and a bunch of stuff.

**03:09:55** I don't wanna do that, but I think it's cool.

**03:09:57** What I do like is you can have menu bar items

**03:10:01** that are either shown or hidden to you

**03:10:03** with specific trigger presets or by using Apple script.

**03:10:06** So for example, in different focus modes,

**03:10:08** you could have different menu bar apps,

**03:10:10** in different locations, different menu bar apps.

**03:10:12** So you can go wild with Apple script.

**03:10:14** You can also now create groups of icons

**03:10:17** that can be expanded by hovering over an icon

**03:10:20** on the menu bar.

**03:10:21** So you create a little icon.

**03:10:23** And when you hover over it, it expands and shows you

**03:10:25** like a bunch of different menu bar items

**03:10:27** that you've put behind it.

**03:10:28** It's like folders basically, but in the menu bar.

**03:10:31** Nice.

**03:10:32** My last app recommendation

**03:10:33** is not an app recommendation at all,

**03:10:36** but it is a feature of Sonoma.

**03:10:39** On Safari, you can now click add to dock

**03:10:42** and make any webpage into an app.

**03:10:45** And you can also do this in shortcut.

**03:10:47** So you can turn any shortcut in your system

**03:10:50** into an app on the dock.

**03:10:52** But here's the thing.

**03:10:53** It doesn't have to stay on the dock.

**03:10:55** Which I didn't know for a really long time.

**03:10:58** So yes, this is the thing that I think people don't realize

**03:11:01** is like that add to dock feature,

**03:11:03** every time I click it, the very next thing I do

**03:11:05** is pull that thing right off the dock

**03:11:07** and poof it out of existence.

**03:11:09** And it doesn't matter because Spotlight will still pick it up

**03:11:13** or Alfred will pick it up or whatever you're using,

**03:11:15** Raycast will pick it up.

**03:11:16** So this I have used for every website now

**03:11:21** and every shortcut that I use on my Mac,

**03:11:23** I add all of them to dock

**03:11:25** and make a little tiny app out of them

**03:11:26** and then just call them from Alfred.

**03:11:28** So I was very confused about this

**03:11:30** because they don't live in the applications folder,

**03:11:32** but they live in a separate applications folder.

**03:11:34** They live in users applications folder.

**03:11:37** Why?

**03:11:38** Everyone has completely forgotten the existence of until now.

**03:11:41** Or if you're like, where did those things go?

**03:11:43** Oh, right, the user application folder.

**03:11:46** How strange.

**03:11:47** My final recommendation is Peak,

**03:11:49** which is a fitness widgets app

**03:11:51** that I've mentioned to you in the past.

**03:11:53** What I really like about this app,

**03:11:54** you can use it to view a bunch of stuff about your fitness.

**03:11:58** I just wanted one widget that would show my activity rings

**03:12:01** and my step count in the same widget.

**03:12:03** And it lets me do that.

**03:12:03** And you can have widgets that you configure

**03:12:06** with the whatever things you want to access

**03:12:09** about your fitness from Apple Health that it has access to.

**03:12:13** So I just think it's a very nice way

**03:12:14** of getting a visually attractive widget

**03:12:17** that has the two pieces of information

**03:12:19** I most want a glance from my iPhone

**03:12:22** about my activity for the day.

**03:12:23** Okay, and according to my timer,

**03:12:25** we have stopped the show at four hours and 28 seconds,

**03:12:29** which I'm going to just round down to four hours

**03:12:31** and say that we made it.

**03:12:32** Well, when it's edited, it will be under four hours,

**03:12:35** I expect.

**03:12:36** Right, but Mike, I mean, the real thing here

**03:12:39** is we started this afternoon and it's now 9 p.m.

**03:12:42** Oh my God.

**03:12:45** Well, that's the apps.
