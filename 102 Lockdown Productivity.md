# Cortex - 102: Lockdown Productivity
**00:00:00** So how you doing?

**00:00:01** Mike, nothing in my world is different from the last time we spoke.

**00:00:07** Everything is the same.

**00:00:08** So let's just go straight into the show.

**00:00:10** All right, so we said that we were going to talk about your spaceship U video.

**00:00:14** I was initially, I think at the end of the last episode, I referenced it as like, oh,

**00:00:19** we're going to talk a lot about working from home, right?

**00:00:22** Yeah, this is this is Cortex-102.

**00:00:26** And I think in your initial pitch of we're over 100 and for podcast numbers that are

**00:00:32** easy for you to remember when referencing stuff for people in the future.

**00:00:36** Yeah.

**00:00:37** 101 was like productivity 101.

**00:00:39** And then if we're following the college numbering structure, this would be course 102, working

**00:00:45** from home, I think was the was the rough idea.

**00:00:48** The more I thought about it, and the more that because I've watched the video, I watched

**00:00:52** the director's commentary that you put out for your Patreon subscribers.

**00:00:57** And I kind of realized that this idea and the time that we're in right now, it's more

**00:01:04** than just working from home.

**00:01:06** It's bringing your work to home, but doing everything at home.

**00:01:12** And that's slightly different.

**00:01:14** So like working from home will be a part of this episode, but it's also going to have

**00:01:20** some quarantine working from home, which is a different thing.

**00:01:24** It's like an extra level.

**00:01:26** It's like it's like level two of working from home, because not only are you working from

**00:01:30** home, you also can't then go out afterwards.

**00:01:34** You just go to another part of the home.

**00:01:37** It's a very different beast.

**00:01:39** Yeah, it's working from home slash working from home arrest.

**00:01:45** That's a little bit what it's like.

**00:01:46** Right, right.

**00:01:47** It's a house arrest type deal.

**00:01:48** Okay.

**00:01:49** I'm full of it in those terms.

**00:01:51** I'm kind of pleased that you went with the spaceship metaphor rather than the prisoner

**00:01:55** metaphor for the video.

**00:01:57** Yeah, no, the spaceship metaphor is much better for a whole variety of reasons.

**00:02:01** Yeah.

**00:02:02** No, I get what you mean that in the situation of doing everything from home is like a level

**00:02:09** of difficulty above simply a conversation about working from home, but one necessarily

**00:02:16** contains the other.

**00:02:17** And also the whole circumstances around working from home right now is typically different

**00:02:23** to the before time of working from home, which was that most people would choose it.

**00:02:29** And it was like, I have this great thing now.

**00:02:32** I've always wanted to work from home and stay in my pyjamas, do my work.

**00:02:38** And so it was like, for a lot of people, like a success or a badge of honor or like a reward.

**00:02:45** But now it's like, you've got to do it whether you want to do it or not.

**00:02:49** And there are people that do and there are people that don't and there are people that

**00:02:52** think that they can't write or people that actually can't.

**00:02:55** And it's it's a very different way of being put into this environment for a lot of people

**00:03:01** with no time to prepare.

**00:03:03** Yeah.

**00:03:04** So I also I also think because there are great challenges of working from home, which are

**00:03:09** non obvious before you actually do it.

**00:03:12** For sure.

**00:03:13** There has been a proportion of people who were always thinking, God, I would just love

**00:03:17** to work from home who are now going, nope.

**00:03:22** I have been disabused of my fanciful idea about what it would be like to work at home.

**00:03:30** And it's a time when you can recognize how helpful a lot of the structures in the world

**00:03:37** are that you may otherwise just take for granted.

**00:03:39** You're like, oh, working from home.

**00:03:42** It's going to be just like working in the office, except minus all the annoying parts.

**00:03:46** It's like, oh, no, that's not what it's like.

**00:03:49** How about a different set of annoying parts?

**00:03:51** You can have that instead.

**00:03:52** So I actually think it is in real time like people listening in real time in May of 2020.

**00:04:00** This is probably a good time to do this episode, to have this discussion, because most people

**00:04:06** that have started working from home, the shine will have worn off by now.

**00:04:10** Yeah, for sure.

**00:04:11** So this is a good time to maybe you think you understand or have understood the way

**00:04:16** that this is working for you.

**00:04:19** Maybe we can help add some stuff in to make it a little bit more easy and more manageable.

**00:04:25** So Spaceship U is the concept behind this video.

**00:04:28** Can you give a recap of the overall idea of what this concept means?

**00:04:34** Yeah, I think the way I would put it is if there's anything that I feel like I know about

**00:04:41** being productive and working, it's this important concept of the separation of spaces and to

**00:04:51** associate doing different activities in different areas.

**00:04:57** This for me is something that over the course of my life has been an idea that maybe is

**00:05:00** like the most persistent idea that has stuck with me in all the various iterations of how

**00:05:06** I work is always trying to be very strict about you do work in this area and you relax

**00:05:13** in this area and to separate those things out.

**00:05:16** So this has been a real background idea that I think once I talk about it in terms of Spaceship

**00:05:22** U, it becomes obvious like, oh, I've been discussing this idea in various different

**00:05:27** ways for years is like coming back to the same concept.

**00:05:31** Like going to the library to write.

**00:05:33** Yes, exactly.

**00:05:35** The thing with Spaceship U is there's now this great framing device, which is a global

**00:05:45** pandemic, which I think really highlights the need for structure in a person's life in

**00:05:55** ways that may not have been obvious before.

**00:05:57** Yeah.

**00:05:58** And so I think that this is really this key concept of either working from home or just

**00:06:06** being in a self isolation situation that there's this really key meta skill, which is

**00:06:13** creating structure for yourself.

**00:06:17** And that can mean a lot of different things.

**00:06:20** But I think that one of the easiest ways to get started with this concept is with as much

**00:06:28** physical separation of the spaces that you possibly can do.

**00:06:33** And so I think the four starter spaces that I have for if you're in an environment like you

**00:06:39** need a place to sleep, you need a place to work, you need a place to exercise and you need a

**00:06:45** place to relax.

**00:06:46** And as much as you can distinguish those spaces from each other, you should do that.

**00:06:52** And so I think that's that's the overall idea of what's going on with Spaceship U.

**00:06:56** But you present it in a really nice way of like showing the isolation as being in space.

**00:07:02** Like it's just like a really clever way to create something softer than what's actually

**00:07:06** happening.

**00:07:08** I'm being a little delicate.

**00:07:10** And I think it was the right way to do it.

**00:07:12** Like I remember what you told me about this idea and like I really pressed on you that I

**00:07:17** thought it was a good one to pursue.

**00:07:19** Right.

**00:07:19** Because the framing device is so much better than if you just presented this video, even like

**00:07:26** the yearly themes video that you did where you're like, I have this idea that I think will be

**00:07:30** useful to you in the situation that we're in.

**00:07:32** Go around your home and do this stuff.

**00:07:35** It's way too real, but showing it in this fictionalized world of like we're all going up in

**00:07:42** space because the world isn't habitable anymore.

**00:07:44** Right.

**00:07:45** And we're going to take care of it and then you can come back.

**00:07:48** It's a way nicer way to get this message across to me in an entertaining way rather than in a way

**00:07:54** where I have to face my reality while watching it.

**00:07:58** Right.

**00:07:59** You're just floating in a little spaceship.

**00:08:00** Yeah.

**00:08:01** You're not locked down in your home.

**00:08:02** Yeah.

**00:08:03** They're two fundamentally different things.

**00:08:05** And it allows for a nice metaphorical separation for when you are trying to put these things into a

**00:08:11** fact at home anyway.

**00:08:13** You know, like it helps you think like, oh, I'm just priming the physical part of the core.

**00:08:19** Right.

**00:08:19** Like that's what I'm doing right now.

**00:08:21** And it's just nice.

**00:08:22** I think those I think humans like that type of stuff.

**00:08:25** No, I agree with that.

**00:08:27** And it also sort of goes to the theme video that I made where there's a question of resonance.

**00:08:32** And I think it's it's easier for these ideas to sometimes resonate with people in a particular form.

**00:08:38** And in talking to people, I could see that the spaceship idea was resonant with a lot of people.

**00:08:44** I'm like, oh, okay, good.

**00:08:45** This is this is on the right track.

**00:08:48** But part of the reason I was able to make the video so quickly is because it is also an idea that I've

**00:08:52** been trying to write and work on in various forms, like spoiler alert, you know, these aren't just good

**00:08:59** ideas for the pandemic.

**00:09:01** This is, you know, spaceship U is life, but I'd never quite found the right way to pitch it.

**00:09:10** And so, yeah, like the pandemic provided both the idea of the spaceship, which had never really crossed my

**00:09:15** mind before.

**00:09:16** And it is a nice framing device.

**00:09:18** I do have it in the back of my mind that maybe at some point in the future, I'd like to do like a like a

**00:09:23** spaceship U version two if there's a way to do it and remove the framing of the pandemic.

**00:09:29** But, you know, that'll that'll be like at some point in the future, maybe.

**00:09:32** Yeah, I mean, because that is the second part of it.

**00:09:34** That is almost the yearly themes idea part of it, like these are just good ideas that you can put into effect in

**00:09:42** your life always.

**00:09:43** Yeah, yeah.

**00:09:44** And I'm really happy with the way it came out.

**00:09:46** I had this I had this little bit of a conflict of because I don't really like to do videos that are

**00:09:51** contemporary.

**00:09:53** I just had this little bit of a conflict of like, oh, man, this is an idea I've been mulling over for like a decade.

**00:09:58** And I don't entirely want to spend it on a contemporary video.

**00:10:03** Yeah.

**00:10:03** But I'm glad I did.

**00:10:04** Like, I'm glad I did this.

**00:10:06** And and if I want to do a version two that more generalizes it, that's always an option.

**00:10:11** But I'm glad I did it this way.

**00:10:12** And it's been very positively received.

**00:10:15** Yeah, I've been pleased with the way it came out.

**00:10:18** But, you know, like, I think if this show has proved anything, the two of us always have various ideas about being

**00:10:24** productive, like, you know, you can incorporate these into another thing later on.

**00:10:29** Right. Like, they're not burned by being used here.

**00:10:33** But I think it was good to put this out there for now.

**00:10:37** This idea of there are like these four things you got to be physical, you've got to have somewhere to work, you've got to have

**00:10:43** somewhere to sleep, you've got to have somewhere to relax and that these spaces need to be defined in some way.

**00:10:49** It's really good.

**00:10:50** Like, it is a very powerful message.

**00:10:53** But I actually want to jump ahead a little bit in what I prepared for today to talk about some of the practicalities of creating these

**00:11:00** spaces at home, because I know, like, I've been I've been reading some of the feedback to the video and stuff.

**00:11:05** And I think that's something that a lot of people have struggled with, which is like I live in a one bedroom apartment or

**00:11:13** I have children.

**00:11:14** You know, like there are like various reasons why I can't split up my home.

**00:11:18** Like, I have one computer.

**00:11:19** How can and it's fixed to a desk?

**00:11:21** Like, how am I supposed to do this?

**00:11:23** And I thought that maybe here we have a lot more time to expand than you do in the videos.

**00:11:29** Right. So maybe we could dig into some of these practical things a little bit.

**00:11:35** It's like so kind of the idea of if you want to do this, how do you split up your living environment

**00:11:42** to give you these four things?

**00:11:45** So like, let's imagine maybe we could do some scenarios here, right?

**00:11:49** Let's imagine someone who lives with other people, they live in a flat share.

**00:11:54** They have just a bedroom.

**00:11:55** They maybe have a desk, small desk, which their laptop lives on.

**00:12:00** And that's all that they have, like a laptop, a desk, a chair and a bed.

**00:12:04** Right. Like, how would you start thinking about or even is there a way you can start thinking about somebody being able to divide up

**00:12:11** those sections in their living space?

**00:12:14** Yeah, well, it's an interesting thing because with this part of it, how do you adapt this to you in particular?

**00:12:22** There's a variety of things that are possible and you have to be looking for what are the things that work for you.

**00:12:30** And so it's funny that you have this as the first one, because I was thinking about when I lived in London and I was newly married,

**00:12:40** my wife and I shared a single room in a flat share.

**00:12:45** Right. And it was like the two of us in one bedroom.

**00:12:48** And then there were some flatmates who had their own bedrooms.

**00:12:52** I wonder what it's like to be CGP Grey's flatmate.

**00:12:56** Perfectly fine.

**00:13:01** But it's like I think that's probably the most I guess maybe aside from college

**00:13:08** and sharing a dorm room, like maybe that was the most space constrained I've ever been in a living situation.

**00:13:16** I've started you out on hard mode here.

**00:13:19** Like I have particularly chosen hard mode because I know that this is a thing that a lot of our listeners will be dealing with.

**00:13:25** They live in big cities or if they're like if they're young.

**00:13:28** Yeah. And so when I was writing this, I like I had in mind some of these kind of situations in life or like when I lived in a studio apartment or all the rest of it.

**00:13:38** So in this scenario, if you're living in a flat share, it is very probable that you do have a laptop.

**00:13:47** Right. Like you probably don't have a big desktop computer.

**00:13:51** Yeah, I'm assuming laptop is is probably the thing for most people here.

**00:13:57** And so how can you divide stuff?

**00:14:00** I think the biggest place to start is the recreation work division there.

**00:14:07** And on a computer, the thing that I would totally do is to have two different accounts on that computer to separate out the work from recreation.

**00:14:19** And so the way I used to do this is one of the accounts on my computer was everything is installed on this account.

**00:14:27** It was the kind of default account.

**00:14:30** And I had a separate account then that was for just writing.

**00:14:34** Yeah. So that's the way I divided those two.

**00:14:37** Different desktop backgrounds.

**00:14:38** Yeah. So you have two accounts.

**00:14:40** You can change what programs are available to you in in each of those accounts.

**00:14:45** Yeah. You want to have different desktop backgrounds for sure.

**00:14:49** That's something you want to do.

**00:14:50** So it like visually looks as different as possible.

**00:14:55** I would probably say, though, that for most people, if you're going to do two accounts, you probably actually want to more clearly separate out like the recreation.

**00:15:06** So like the video game part of it.

**00:15:08** So if you've got steam installed on your computer, I would probably say, like, if I don't know something about someone's work, you want to quarantine that part of it and, you know, have have the other account for sort of.

**00:15:20** Yeah. The work account should be where everything is.

**00:15:25** Yeah. And the recreation account can be where the games and stuff are.

**00:15:29** I think that is kind of counter to the way that we usually talk about things.

**00:15:33** We both when we're looking at work stuff, try and pare it down.

**00:15:37** But again, like these situations are different.

**00:15:39** This is a very particular type of thing.

**00:15:42** Unless you're in a situation where you know that you have like one mission critical activity that is really high value and you want to cordon that off.

**00:15:52** I think the problem that most people are going to deal with is the reverse problem of especially in a lockdown situation that like recreation

**00:16:03** just kind of spreads everywhere.

**00:16:05** And it's it's really easy to just start looking at YouTube or to like, you know, oh, I'm just going to take a quick 20 minute factorial break, which is like something that no human on Earth has ever accomplished.

**00:16:18** And you're trying to isolate that stuff.

**00:16:22** Again, this will depend differently on like different operating systems.

**00:16:26** But the nice thing about having separate accounts is you can also do things like having the websites blocked on one account, but not the other.

**00:16:32** Like there's a there's a lot of ways to play around with this.

**00:16:34** But for beginners starting for sure, pick out all the entertainment recreation stuff and put that into an account and make it live there.

**00:16:44** Have a different desktop background, anything else that you can change about the way that account looks, you should totally do it so that it seems as different as possible.

**00:16:53** And then this is the dumbest thing in the world.

**00:16:55** But I did this when I lived in a studio and I just had one desk and a laptop is sitting at that desk facing the wall.

**00:17:04** That was work mode.

**00:17:06** And then I would just move the chair around to the edge of the desk so that my I was like looking at the room.

**00:17:13** That was like recreation mode.

**00:17:15** And these things can be really dumb like that.

**00:17:18** But I have really found that if you are consistent about it, it trains your brain into this mode.

**00:17:27** You're what you're trying to do at first is to just introduce these little moments of hesitation.

**00:17:34** And I think that's a way that you start training up your brain.

**00:17:38** So like obviously you can flip over to the recreation account to watch YouTube at any moment, but it doesn't hurt to put up as many barriers as possible.

**00:17:48** And I also really like getting it in your mind that it's perfectly fine if you feel like I can't do work now.

**00:17:56** I want to take a break, but you're training yourself to be intentional about it.

**00:18:01** So you say, OK, I'm going to do that.

**00:18:04** And I'm clearly deciding because I'm just moving the chair 90 degrees around the desk.

**00:18:10** And I'm like, I've decided to do that.

**00:18:13** And I'm not lying to myself sitting here at this computer, you know, looking at the work count.

**00:18:18** I'm deciding to log out and log in like that.

**00:18:21** Even that is like, yes, if you have the ability to make some physical movement, that is really great.

**00:18:27** Like that's key.

**00:18:28** But if all you can do is change your account, great.

**00:18:31** Like add some friction in, as you say, not so that it's to stop you, but it is just that when you do it, you know you've done it.

**00:18:39** Yeah, for me, honestly, like using the iPad is one of the big benefits for me.

**00:18:45** Like I have different work that I do on my I'm on my iPad.

**00:18:50** Yeah. And so when I'm sitting down on my iPad, it's like, right, I know what mode I'm in right now.

**00:18:55** Right. Like I know the types of work that I'm going to be doing here.

**00:18:58** When I sit down at my Mac, I know what I'm doing here as well.

**00:19:01** Like it's very rare for me to do non recording or editing on my Mac.

**00:19:08** I just record and edit here.

**00:19:10** I don't sit and go through all my email.

**00:19:12** I don't sit and write my show notes.

**00:19:13** Right. Like I don't deal with social media type stuff.

**00:19:16** Like all of that is done on my iPad.

**00:19:19** So I have the distinction there from devices.

**00:19:22** So I just wanted to throw this in there as like, if you have an iPad, a lot of people have an iPad.

**00:19:28** Now might be a really good time to get to know iPad OS.

**00:19:34** Yeah, I'll back that.

**00:19:36** And again, this is where longtime listeners of the show will know many years ago we were talking about the multipad lifestyle.

**00:19:43** And this is part of the reason why I was such a proponent of this.

**00:19:47** Like it's great to have multiple devices because iOS, just by the mere fact that it works differently than your computer does,

**00:19:57** is another way that differentiates these spaces from each other.

**00:20:02** And like I think that's that's a really good way to have this distinction between two different things.

**00:20:08** Like, oh, your brain associates over time.

**00:20:12** iOS is for email and for administration or however you decide to divide that up and then like, oh, Mac OS on this account,

**00:20:20** that feels this way for this other kind of activity.

**00:20:23** And if you don't want to work on your iPad, your iPad is a really great tool to do all of the relaxation stuff on.

**00:20:30** Yeah, yeah, yeah, I think I've had for most people leans more towards the chillaxing side of the spectrum, which is great as to the working side of the spectrum.

**00:20:41** Those devices are way better, right, like a watching video and right and like social media, then Max are like, that's just the thing about it.

**00:20:50** That's all you want to use it for.

**00:20:51** Then go for it.

**00:20:52** But if all you have is like a MacBook Air, that's awesome too.

**00:20:56** You just got to set them up and set them up right and observe that and pay attention to that.

**00:21:01** This is one of those things where it's easy to watch the video and be like, well, I don't have the space.

**00:21:06** We're already in conceptual town because we're in a spaceship, right?

**00:21:10** So think of it conceptually.

**00:21:13** So like for me, I don't have enough space in my home to define a fixed exercise point.

**00:21:22** I could give up my office, but my office is more important for me than the exercise area.

**00:21:27** What I do have, though, is a yoga mat.

**00:21:30** Right. And the yoga mat goes on the ground.

**00:21:33** The exercise happens on the yoga mat.

**00:21:35** So when the yoga mat's down, exercises occurring.

**00:21:38** It happens in the big green rectangle of this yoga.

**00:21:43** Yeah, you are creating a new space.

**00:21:46** Yes. The yoga mat is like a magic carpet that you're exercising on top of.

**00:21:50** And that is the space in which this occurs.

**00:21:52** Honestly, the video has been very helpful to me to be more active.

**00:21:57** That's the thing I've taken away from it, because really that was the one that I needed

**00:22:00** the most help with for myself.

**00:22:01** The rest of it I've mostly worked out.

**00:22:03** But it has really locked in to me like you saying about like exercises non-optional.

**00:22:09** Whilst I hate to hear that so much, I have taken it on board.

**00:22:15** And I'm exercising more now than I was before.

**00:22:18** Yeah, that's a message that is part of my own realizing the seriousness of the situation.

**00:22:24** It's like exercise is non-optional.

**00:22:27** It has had the same effect on me of recontextualizing exercise in my brain and realizing how necessary it is.

**00:22:35** I don't have my own like dedicated space for exercise.

**00:22:39** Like I do the same thing where I am borrowing some of my wife's space for exercise.

**00:22:43** So it's always a little bit like, oh, are you going to use it?

**00:22:45** Like, OK, great. And it's the same thing about like

**00:22:48** OK, it doesn't need to be, oh, I have a home gym and this home gym is a physically separate

**00:22:54** room that has floor to ceiling mirrors on it so I can check my form as I'm working out.

**00:23:00** Like that doesn't need to be what it is.

**00:23:03** I also think exercise is a great place to talk about the kind of psychological separation

**00:23:10** that can happen between spaces.

**00:23:12** So many people will have an exercise playlist.

**00:23:17** Like this is the playlist I'm listening to to pump myself up to exercise.

**00:23:22** And one of the really key things about doing something like that is.

**00:23:29** If you decide I'm going to have an exercise playlist, this is now becoming part of the

**00:23:34** like the virtual space that is the exercise room is this playlist.

**00:23:40** You have to pick songs that you're perfectly fine with not listening to.

**00:23:47** Under other circumstances.

**00:23:49** So if you have an exercise playlist, don't listen to those songs when you're not exercising.

**00:23:56** And I do the same thing with my work playlist, like the songs that I listen to on repeat when I'm

**00:24:03** working, those songs are now forever removed from just the general rotation of music consumption.

**00:24:11** And if you do this with the exercise playlist and you do this with a working playlist, I think

**00:24:16** those are two prime areas where again, you can create this sense of now this is a different

**00:24:25** space.

**00:24:26** Oh, because this I'm at the gym and the gym music is playing and the only place that I ever hear the

**00:24:31** gym music is in my gym.

**00:24:33** Like, oh, I'm here working.

**00:24:34** My face is looking at the blank wall of my home.

**00:24:38** But and I have the working playlist on and like this is what I do now.

**00:24:43** This is like different acoustic environment.

**00:24:46** I do think like a key thing that people sometimes miss with this is it's not just about associating

**00:24:52** music with a place.

**00:24:53** It's about removing that association from other places.

**00:24:58** Like you cannot listen to that music in different circumstances.

**00:25:01** Anybody that's ever set one of their favorite pop songs as their alarm knows what you're

**00:25:06** talking about.

**00:25:07** Right.

**00:25:07** Yes, that's a great example.

**00:25:09** I have this song.

**00:25:09** I would love to hear it when I wake up.

**00:25:12** Yeah, that lasts for a couple of weeks.

**00:25:14** And then you never want to hear that song again.

**00:25:17** Yeah, yeah, no, for sure.

**00:25:18** For sure.

**00:25:19** I forget.

**00:25:20** I can't remember the name of it, but I still have like the opening bars of this one Seagor

**00:25:24** Ross song, which was my alarm when I was going to going to work as a teacher.

**00:25:29** I still can't hear the first couple bars of that without having this like like I'm drowning

**00:25:35** feeling.

**00:25:35** It's terrible.

**00:25:38** Yeah, but it's a great example of how I think there's like your brain has these hooks that are

**00:25:44** just there waiting to be used.

**00:25:47** And if you just pay a little bit of attention, you can take these things which are like, oh,

**00:25:51** isn't it funny that I feel like I'm drowning every time I hear the song that was my wake up

**00:25:56** alarm and be like, can we turn this to be useful instead of instead of just like an

**00:26:00** accidental thing that occurs?

**00:26:02** And then you get the satisfactory feeling that you are in control of your own brain.

**00:26:09** Yeah, because you've realized you got one up on it, right?

**00:26:12** Yeah.

**00:26:13** Oh, for sure.

**00:26:14** For sure.

**00:26:14** Like the number of times that I don't feel like writing at first, you know, now having done this

**00:26:23** for years, if I'm feeling particularly resistant, there's a couple of the songs that are

**00:26:27** especially burned into my brain as like, this is writing music.

**00:26:31** And if I put those on and just kind of sit in front of the computer and wait, it's like, well, more

**00:26:39** times than not, like typing is going to start.

**00:26:42** Because this is just what this music is for.

**00:26:44** It's for physically moving your hands on the keyboard.

**00:26:47** So one of mine that I've recently started doing, which is kind of follow up from a few

**00:26:50** episodes ago where I said that I was using like noise canceling a lot more, right?

**00:26:55** Just to just create space in the home.

**00:26:57** And I was like, oh, I should try pairing this with the app Dark Noise that we spoke about in

**00:27:03** the state of the apps episode.

**00:27:04** They have a sound in there.

**00:27:05** I think it's called beach.

**00:27:07** And it's just the sound of waves crashing.

**00:27:09** And I've been using it when I am struggling to get some writing done.

**00:27:14** Right. So I will just put that on and then it's like a simple sound.

**00:27:17** It's not music.

**00:27:19** And I can just do it.

**00:27:20** So I've been really enjoying using that app because also it's got some fun stuff in it, like

**00:27:25** coffee shop noises.

**00:27:27** Yeah.

**00:27:27** So it's like I'm outside.

**00:27:29** Right. So yeah, more than just because like the white noise, brown noise, those I hate that

**00:27:35** constant.

**00:27:36** Yeah, I don't I don't use any of the sounds either.

**00:27:38** I don't like them.

**00:27:38** Yeah, I really hate like white noise in a white noise machine.

**00:27:43** I just want background sounds.

**00:27:45** So I've been using that a lot for for trying to help me get through tasks that I've been

**00:27:50** struggling with.

**00:27:52** It's funny that you mentioned that because there's also like a time way that you can do these

**00:27:57** kind of associations that are not physical differences, but they're psychological differences.

**00:28:02** And my wife and I have gotten into the habit on the weekends like, oh, the weekend often is

**00:28:08** like sitting around and reading, you know, just relaxing kind of time.

**00:28:12** And I just happened to do it a few times to put on this foresty woods background kind of

**00:28:18** noise while we're reading in the afternoon.

**00:28:21** And it's like, man, three weekends in a row of doing that.

**00:28:24** And now that is the oh, this is the sound when we're reading sound, you know, and it's just

**00:28:29** interesting how fast your brain is willing to associate with that.

**00:28:33** And now it's very clearly like, oh, no, this this soundscape is just for the weekends.

**00:28:37** That's what this soundscape is.

**00:28:39** I know it's Sunday because it sounds like the forest and it just works really well.

**00:28:44** I'm just going to say, I don't know if we're going to talk about this later or not, but like Animal

**00:28:47** Crossing has been real great for me still with like, I know where I am in the week.

**00:28:52** Yeah. I know where I am in the day.

**00:28:53** Like having something which helps you with that.

**00:28:55** It's adding structure in the same way that like I do all of my show prep as my first task of the day.

**00:29:03** I only do it in the mornings.

**00:29:05** It will all be done by 12 after 12.

**00:29:08** I don't do prep for shows anymore.

**00:29:10** I will do other work because that is the work that takes the most from me.

**00:29:15** It's the work I have to work on the hardest.

**00:29:17** So I do it first and do it because it could take me the longest.

**00:29:22** I also need the most caffeine.

**00:29:23** Right. So that is when I would do that.

**00:29:26** I think that is sitting down writing out lines, doing research, all that stuff.

**00:29:29** That is my first task of the day.

**00:29:31** Every day always before I start doing anything else.

**00:29:35** But that is me adding structure in.

**00:29:37** Right. Like all of these things, all of this, the whole thing, right?

**00:29:42** Spaceship you structure.

**00:29:44** You've got to put structure in your life and you can do it in so many ways.

**00:29:48** You can do it by tricking your brain with music.

**00:29:51** You can do it by saying I will only do these tasks in the morning.

**00:29:54** Like you only write in the mornings, right?

**00:29:57** Yeah. Right.

**00:29:58** So like you like morning time is writing time or like forest sounds means reading time.

**00:30:03** It's Sunday, right?

**00:30:04** Yeah. And then it's like, oh, that yoga mat, that's where the workouts happen.

**00:30:09** They don't happen anywhere else.

**00:30:10** That soft thing in the corner.

**00:30:11** That's where sleeping happens.

**00:30:13** Nothing else happens there. Right.

**00:30:14** Like this side of the desk, this is where work is.

**00:30:17** This side of the desk.

**00:30:18** I got the window. I can relax. Right.

**00:30:20** Like, yeah, finding structure is so important.

**00:30:24** And it's always been important for working at home.

**00:30:27** But it's even more important when home is all there is.

**00:30:31** There are a bunch of meta skills in life that are really key

**00:30:37** in accomplishing whatever it is you want to do.

**00:30:40** Like one of those incredibly important meta skills, it's just like time management,

**00:30:44** being aware of how you're spending your time.

**00:30:46** And one of those other skills is this self structure.

**00:30:50** And it can express itself in a lot of ways.

**00:30:53** And I think part of the lockdown situation is that.

**00:31:00** Many people are like forced to become aware

**00:31:04** in a very visceral way how much work the structure of the external world was doing

**00:31:13** in getting them to do what they need to do when that's been removed.

**00:31:17** And so it's like you can just suddenly realize like, oh, God,

**00:31:21** I have to create some structure here.

**00:31:24** Otherwise, I'm just going to drift forever.

**00:31:26** One of the ones I'll mention, which it doesn't work great for me now,

**00:31:30** but I did used to do it in the beginning is also just clothing.

**00:31:34** So, you know, you have like shirts that you would wear

**00:31:39** when you're working or when you're not working.

**00:31:41** Like some people really like to do this, if they'll have a have a work shirt.

**00:31:45** And I did do this in the beginning.

**00:31:48** I eventually found like, oh, I didn't I didn't really need to after a while.

**00:31:51** But for some people, this is another way to do this.

**00:31:54** Like I have put on the work shirt or one of my comments that was, oh, that's genius,

**00:31:59** was someone said they have a work necklace.

**00:32:02** And so they're like, when I put this necklace on like this is work time

**00:32:05** and then I take the necklace off and it is not work time.

**00:32:08** I feel like, oh, that's that's another great kind of token to do this.

**00:32:11** But even as I say, like, oh, I don't really use the clothing one anymore.

**00:32:16** There is a little way in which, again, it kind of snuck into my life now,

**00:32:20** which is have a pair of slippers that I've made this decision about,

**00:32:24** like only wearing the slippers on the weekend.

**00:32:26** And so, again, it it weirdly gives the weekend a particular feeling of like,

**00:32:31** oh, it's obviously Sunday because I'm wearing the slippers.

**00:32:34** And there's the forest sound like how Sunday does this feel?

**00:32:38** Maximum Sunday. That's how it feels.

**00:32:40** Various levels of pajamas.

**00:32:44** Yeah, you have your casual pajamas and you have your formal pajamas.

**00:32:48** And you know what?

**00:32:49** That's not even a joke.

**00:32:50** Like, that's perfectly fine if you have casual informal pajamas.

**00:32:53** Like, yeah, your brain will just start latching onto it.

**00:32:56** Maybe it's just t-shirts and basketball shorts in the week and silk on the weekend.

**00:33:00** You know, you do you right.

**00:33:01** Like, what makes you comfortable?

**00:33:03** I want to go back to some other practical things.

**00:33:07** I know I'd seen this one a lot.

**00:33:09** I have children. How can I follow any of this?

**00:33:11** I mean, children are chaos balls in your house.

**00:33:15** So, yeah, kids make it harder.

**00:33:18** And there's nothing that people with children like more than hearing advice

**00:33:22** from someone who doesn't have children.

**00:33:23** So I'm not really going to have a lot of specific tips to say here,

**00:33:30** except that you can't tell me that even with children,

**00:33:33** it wouldn't be a good idea to have a dedicated workspace in your house.

**00:33:38** Because I assume people that have children

**00:33:42** that have to work from home now are still expected to work, right?

**00:33:46** Yeah, I know it's significantly more difficult

**00:33:49** because you also have to be a teacher, I guess, in a lot of instances.

**00:33:54** But I'm assuming at the same time that your work is expecting you to work.

**00:33:59** So maybe you're working at weird hours.

**00:34:02** And if that's the case, maybe you need more of this stuff of like

**00:34:06** putting on this t-shirt means that it's work time or this music

**00:34:11** because you will be working at times that you're not used to normally working at.

**00:34:16** Because you haven't been able to work at all when the children are awake.

**00:34:20** Right. So you've got to work when they're asleep.

**00:34:22** So maybe you need more structure that way.

**00:34:24** But like it is this stuff is more difficult than for some or the other.

**00:34:30** But that's why like what I wanted to explore is that you don't have to lift this wholesale.

**00:34:35** Mm hmm. Right.

**00:34:36** Like there is a type of person that does need to do literally everything

**00:34:40** that you've told them in the exact order that you've told them.

**00:34:44** But not everybody does and not everybody can.

**00:34:47** But there are definitely parts of it that anybody can use even a little bit.

**00:34:53** Yeah. Yeah. And like having a different space for work, especially, you know,

**00:34:58** when those children eating perhaps depends on the work like, you know,

**00:35:02** you might want to do that.

**00:35:03** You might want to make sure that you're able to get done what needs to be done.

**00:35:07** But yeah, kids make it harder for sure.

**00:35:09** Flatmates make it harder for sure.

**00:35:13** This episode of Cortex is brought to you by Uni Pizza Ovens.

**00:38:08** We talk about creation station.

**00:38:09** OK, creation station.

**00:38:13** I know from the way you say it, you're saying it like you're getting right at the

**00:38:17** heart of something with this video for me.

**00:38:19** Didn't like that.

**00:38:21** I didn't like creation station.

**00:38:22** Why didn't you like creation station?

**00:38:24** I think it was unnecessarily abstract as a phrase to use.

**00:38:30** Like it could have just been called workstation because I've noticed throughout

**00:38:34** this entire episode you've been referring to it was work.

**00:38:36** Yeah, because it is work.

**00:38:37** Yeah, it's totally work.

**00:38:38** So why did you call it creation station?

**00:38:42** So this being the idea of like you have your place where you're sleeping,

**00:38:46** you have your place where you're exercising, your place where you're

**00:38:49** relaxing and then the place where you're doing the other stuff,

**00:38:52** which you called creation station, creation station, which sounds really lovely.

**00:38:58** Right. It rolls off the tongue.

**00:39:00** But I think doesn't actually sum up in my mind what is being done here.

**00:39:05** Yeah, no, it's very conjunction junction.

**00:39:07** What's your function?

**00:39:08** I get it for the behind the scenes part of it.

**00:39:11** This is where for the video mostly once we get past the first minute and if you

**00:39:19** ignore the last 10 seconds, the pandemic framing is basically completely absent.

**00:39:25** It's like pandemic.

**00:39:26** I never heard of it.

**00:39:27** This is just a great way to live.

**00:39:28** Right.

**00:39:29** That's sort of what the spaceship you video is like in the middle part of it.

**00:39:33** But this this is the one place where if I was making a spaceship

**00:39:40** version to that didn't have the pandemic background, I'd be much more likely to call

**00:39:45** it the workstation. Right.

**00:39:47** But the reason I call it the creation station is because

**00:39:52** I did want to emphasize the point that this is not just about work,

**00:40:01** because if you say the word work, most people are going to associate that with a job.

**00:40:08** And then I know that there's going to be a lot of people who are watching this that

**00:40:13** are either students or who are unemployed or employed, but unable to do their jobs.

**00:40:19** Right. Like the furloughing.

**00:40:20** Right. And so I and being a little facetious,

**00:40:24** like I know why you didn't call it that.

**00:40:26** Yeah. But it's like, but you're also hitting on the one.

**00:40:29** Whenever you make something, there's this funny difference between the audience

**00:40:33** and the creator, where the audience watches a thing and.

**00:40:41** And sort of comes always to the conclusion

**00:40:43** that the creator was completely confident in every single part of this,

**00:40:47** in every single sentence, right, and is like, no, no, the person who created it can

**00:40:53** be uncertain with some parts of it as well.

**00:40:56** And this is one of those moments where I'm like,

**00:40:58** no, it's totally legit.

**00:41:00** Like, why didn't you call it the workstation?

**00:41:02** It's a thing I went back and forth with a lot.

**00:41:04** But because of the context in which the video is being made, I did want to go

**00:41:09** broader, even if I agree that it's probably too broad.

**00:41:15** But I just figure there's like a way higher

**00:41:17** proportion of people who are watching this video at this time are not going to have

**00:41:24** a clear job that they can perform. Yes.

**00:41:27** So I like I wanted to have it be broader here.

**00:41:30** And then this this is also the part where whenever I look at the final videos,

**00:41:35** I can see all of these little pieces that are left over from different versions

**00:41:40** of the script. And this is one of these places where I

**00:41:44** originally wanted to have a much broader discussion about what does creation mean?

**00:41:50** And very quickly realized, like, don't get into this, man.

**00:41:53** Right. Like, it's too much.

**00:41:54** It's too much of a diversion.

**00:41:56** You're going to have to make a decision that's not completely comfortable either

**00:42:00** way. Like, you don't want to call it the workstation.

**00:42:03** Creation Station is the next best name, but including too much of a description

**00:42:07** about what exactly you mean by this is too much.

**00:42:10** So it's got to go.

**00:42:11** And you're kind of left with this in between place.

**00:42:13** Do you want to talk about that here, though?

**00:42:15** I mean, we have the time, right?

**00:42:16** Like, that's the beauty of the show is right.

**00:42:18** Like, yeah, let's get into this part of it.

**00:42:21** So, I mean, let's talk about what humans do

**00:42:24** for each other, Mike, which is hopefully

**00:42:28** create things that they themselves or other people value.

**00:42:34** And that that's sort of the idea of the creation station here is what you want

**00:42:41** to kind of have is like a like a compass point that directs you to like,

**00:42:46** what activity should I do? And I think particularly like.

**00:42:50** When you're younger, it can often seem like.

**00:42:56** What should I do?

**00:42:57** I don't I don't know what I should do.

**00:42:59** Everything is boring and awful, right?

**00:43:02** And a useful compass point is just this idea of, hey,

**00:43:07** the world's a really big place.

**00:43:09** Not everybody can be an expert in everything.

**00:43:13** And the way that the modern world works is people learn skills.

**00:43:18** And then we like we all trade these skills with each other.

**00:43:22** And so you want to be looking at things that you can learn to do,

**00:43:28** which are valuable to other people.

**00:43:31** This is what we generally call work in the world is like you have a skill

**00:43:36** that another person doesn't have and the two of you trade with each other.

**00:43:41** And so at creation station, one of the things you can think of if like you're

**00:43:45** sort of drifting is just kind of thinking about even in the vaguest possible ways

**00:43:53** what things pique your interest just a little bit

**00:43:58** that might also be useful to other people.

**00:44:00** And like, that's a good thing to investigate as let me explore this.

**00:44:06** You know, oh, I like spreadsheets.

**00:44:08** Let me learn about pivot tables, you know, or cooking catches my interest.

**00:44:13** Like, let me let me explore this as a skill.

**00:44:16** And it's a place to get started with that stuff.

**00:44:20** If that's not necessarily obvious to you, you can also start out with like.

**00:44:26** Humans can create things that they themselves value.

**00:44:29** So like, what do you do that you enjoy?

**00:44:33** Like you're tending your garden and no one else in the whole world sees the garden.

**00:44:38** But you but it makes you happy.

**00:44:40** Like that is creating a kind of value in the world, even if it's just a value for

**00:44:45** yourself. So that's why I wanted to go a little bit

**00:44:48** broad with creation station, because this idea of value, it is generally applicable,

**00:44:54** but it's much more applicable in this time because you have way more leeway here

**00:44:59** about what it is that you want to do.

**00:45:01** There's also there's also a part of it, which again, it wouldn't really fit in the

**00:45:05** video, but I think it's also useful.

**00:45:08** So for people who are working remotely

**00:45:12** at jobs, maybe they don't love, it can be sometimes helpful to

**00:45:18** understand that this is still part of like the creation of value.

**00:45:23** Even if you don't love this job, you are still creating something,

**00:45:31** you know, whether it's like organized emails or replies in a knowledge base

**00:45:37** or whatever it is that is of value to your employer.

**00:45:42** And like that's the reason that they pay you, because the thing that you're doing

**00:45:46** is creating value to them.

**00:45:48** And I just think

**00:45:50** from reading comments online, a common situation can be that that sometimes

**00:45:54** people will feel like a job that they don't like can seem

**00:46:00** extra sort of why in a time like this when they're home on their own.

**00:46:07** And so I just think it's useful to point that out.

**00:46:10** Like this is this is part of creation, like this is part of the tapestry of the world.

**00:46:16** There is a really strong

**00:46:19** we're all in this together vibe at the moment.

**00:46:22** Everyone is in the same boat here, right around the world.

**00:46:26** We're all in this.

**00:46:29** So anything that you are doing, no matter what it is,

**00:46:34** he's adding some value back into society at the moment.

**00:46:39** Yeah.

**00:46:39** If you are tech support for an energy company.

**00:46:45** You're helping other people who have problems with their energy right now,

**00:46:50** which means a lot more to people than it typically would have otherwise.

**00:46:55** So not necessarily we all need to start

**00:46:58** putting flowers in our hair and value our jobs, but it's at least more helpful

**00:47:04** framing devices to why you do what you do, even if you don't like it.

**00:47:08** I had a little paragraph that got cut where it was something like if you're able

**00:47:13** to work digitally on the spaceship, no matter what you're doing,

**00:47:17** it's another hand on the like on the wheel, like keeping things turning.

**00:47:21** Right.

**00:47:21** It's like something along those lines of like

**00:47:24** we got to keep this wheel of the economy needs to spin.

**00:47:28** And everyone who can do anything no matter what it is,

**00:47:33** is an additional turning force on this wheel.

**00:47:36** And like that is that is part of this concept of like the creation of something

**00:47:41** that is valued, like an additional positive force on something that needs to keep moving.

**00:47:47** Because if you're if you're doing something right now, it means something to someone.

**00:47:51** Yeah. Otherwise, it wouldn't be happening.

**00:47:53** Yeah. And if you're not, then you are in a

**00:47:58** interesting position of being able to find something else of interest to do

**00:48:04** as a hobby that you've always wanted to undertake.

**00:48:07** Like you have.

**00:48:09** The world given excuse right now to do it.

**00:48:14** That is the gift that you have, right?

**00:48:17** You may have a bit more time in your life to learn to cook,

**00:48:23** to read that book, to write a book, whatever.

**00:48:27** This is a time in which you can do it.

**00:48:29** Right. And I know that's why Creation Station is named Creation Station.

**00:48:34** But I think the word creation now is too heavily tied into being a content

**00:48:38** creator for a lot of people. Yeah, I can see that.

**00:48:42** And I think I think that's where maybe a lot of people get stuck up because

**00:48:45** creation now seems like a barrier, like it's this big thing that you have to do.

**00:48:50** That's that's why the real name of the station is open parentheses, the close

**00:48:56** parentheses creation open parentheses of value close parentheses station.

**00:49:04** Right. Like that's the name of the station.

**00:49:05** Right. That's very awkward, though.

**00:49:10** Perhaps like the the closest second call that I came to was like crafting station.

**00:49:17** That's worse. Yeah, that's why I didn't pick it.

**00:49:19** Yeah, that's worse.

**00:49:21** It's just Minecraft.

**00:49:22** Yeah. Yeah.

**00:49:23** Crafting is going to make people think of Animal Crossing.

**00:49:25** Is this where I'm supposed to play Animal Crossing?

**00:49:27** Like, no, this is not where you're supposed to play Animal Crossing.

**00:49:30** Well, you know, I guess it depends if you're a streamer.

**00:49:33** Well, you know, but see, that's that's like this is actually, I think,

**00:49:36** an interesting point here is when you talk about like things you value,

**00:49:42** there is a little bit of like bleed over into like the recreation part.

**00:49:47** Like what is the what is the difference between the two of these?

**00:49:50** It's a part of part of why I like creation station and talking about like making

**00:49:56** things of value is because like if you are just watching a movie, right?

**00:50:00** You're sitting there and you're watching a movie.

**00:50:02** You can enjoy that.

**00:50:03** That is recreation.

**00:50:04** But if you are not doing anything with having watched that movie,

**00:50:10** you are not able to create something that any other human would value.

**00:50:15** Right.

**00:50:16** But if you like talk about that movie in an entertaining way on a podcast like,

**00:50:20** well, look, now you have created entertainment.

**00:50:22** And it's the same thing with video games.

**00:50:24** Like there's a huge difference between

**00:50:26** I am playing a video game on my own and I am enjoying it.

**00:50:30** It's like, great.

**00:50:31** That is recreation, which we all need.

**00:50:33** But it is not creating anything that another human can conceivably value

**00:50:39** unless you switch it into this.

**00:50:41** Oh, I'm broadcasting it.

**00:50:43** Right. And I'm hopefully talking about it in a way that people find interesting.

**00:50:46** So that's why I think creation station,

**00:50:49** like when you're focusing on learning skills,

**00:50:52** what I was trying to say before with this idea of the compass is like

**00:50:56** there should be some out potential outward direction of these things.

**00:51:01** It doesn't even need to be extremely obvious, but that just like some sort

**00:51:07** of outward projection that another person could conceivably value some version

**00:51:14** of this in the future, and that's that's what distinguishes some activities

**00:51:18** from recreation, which is much more just internal than than like the working

**00:51:25** station, which is more externally directed.

**00:51:27** This episode of Cortex is brought to you by SetApp.

**00:52:32** All right. Now, no one's listening anymore.

**00:52:35** It's just me and you. Oh, OK.

**00:52:37** Just the two of us. Can I stop the recording?

**00:52:39** No. Oh, OK.

**00:52:41** Just in case we want to check this back later on.

**00:52:43** Oh, OK. Just for funsies.

**00:52:45** But no one's here anymore. It's just me.

**00:52:46** OK, so we're just hanging out. OK, cool.

**00:52:48** Yeah, you can move your desk to whatever nonsense it is.

**00:52:51** You like. Great. Thank you.

**00:52:51** I'll touch the microphone. Yes.

**00:52:53** For fun. Yeah, yeah.

**00:52:54** This is just just me and your time.

**00:52:55** I'll eat my yogurt.

**00:52:57** So we've explained, I think the idea behind all of this.

**00:53:00** Right. As you know, because it's just me and you here.

**00:53:02** Yeah. Like why are you recapping what just happened before the ad break?

**00:53:06** I don't know. You know how I talk by now.

**00:53:07** This is what I do.

**00:53:09** How are you really doing all this?

**00:53:11** How are you like honestly fairing with the separation?

**00:53:17** OK, so I have a really hard time talking about this,

**00:53:20** which is why I'm glad it's just the two of us.

**00:53:22** Just with it doesn't matter because it's just me and you now.

**00:53:25** So it's fine. Right.

**00:53:26** I mean, the fact that you keep emphasizing it makes me a little bit suspicious.

**00:53:29** Again, this is how I always talk.

**00:53:33** I mean, in fairness, you do always talk a little bit,

**00:53:36** you know, like you're broadcasting because that's just that's just your

**00:53:39** cadence now. Well, this and also like, especially when we're having these

**00:53:43** conversations, because I'm in this area.

**00:53:47** Right. I've got the microphone in front of me,

**00:53:49** the headphones on and I'm looking at the levels moving on the USB interface.

**00:53:54** Yeah, that's true.

**00:53:55** You do have a very difficult time separating out your socializing space

**00:54:01** from your working space like you're in a you're in a bad place there.

**00:54:04** The Zoom call socializing thing is like it doesn't work so well for me right now

**00:54:09** because I only like to use my proper microphone.

**00:54:12** Yeah, it's my it's a fault of my own doing really.

**00:54:15** Yeah, no, it totally is.

**00:54:17** It's actually normally I would do any FaceTime calls that I would do on my

**00:54:22** like podcasting equipment as well, just like so it sounds better for the other

**00:54:25** person and it's all ready to go.

**00:54:27** But I realized very quickly into the lockdown when catching up with family

**00:54:31** and friends is like, I can't do this, I can't do this in this room because I'm

**00:54:36** like I'm being way more strict about these barriers.

**00:54:39** And I genuinely felt like it was kind of messing with my brain.

**00:54:42** Yeah. Of, oh, I'm taking my office super seriously,

**00:54:48** like more seriously than I ever have in my entire life.

**00:54:51** It's like a sanctified environment.

**00:54:53** But it's also where I could like kick back and put my feet up on the table and just

**00:54:58** chit chat with a friend like these two things don't line up.

**00:55:01** I think I've only really been sitting

**00:55:03** at the iMac for the Zoom calls where there is also some element of professional

**00:55:07** to them. So I might be hanging out with a friend, but we're also like colleagues.

**00:55:13** Right. Right.

**00:55:14** But I have been doing more like there's no pretense of work here

**00:55:19** on the sofa in the living room, like for family and friends.

**00:55:22** You've seen this. We did this.

**00:55:24** Yeah. Yeah. And that's that's exactly what I made.

**00:55:27** A decision really early on was, oh, no, wait a minute.

**00:55:31** I'm changing this.

**00:55:31** I'm doing all of my FaceTime calls on the iPad, on the couch.

**00:55:36** Like I'm just I'm redefining this.

**00:55:38** I'm taking it out of this area.

**00:55:40** Like if I'm if I'm doing a podcast, I'll do it on the equipment.

**00:55:43** And if I'm not doing a podcast, I'm going to do it on the iPad on my couch.

**00:55:48** But again, like we're just socializing between the two of us and staying on the

**00:55:52** equipment and recording for convenience factors.

**00:55:54** Yeah. Well, this is after the show.

**00:55:56** Yeah, we're already here.

**00:55:57** Yeah. But so the so the thing that's that I have a hard time

**00:56:01** talking about and that is extraordinarily poorly received by some people is that.

**00:56:10** I'm doing great, like, OK, it's the honest truth that's difficult

**00:56:17** to talk about is my theme, like year of clarity, couldn't more perfectly be aligned

**00:56:24** for this sort of situation.

**00:56:26** Yeah. In that regard, you really lucked out with a theme this year, didn't you?

**00:56:30** Yeah, you drew the short stick on that one.

**00:56:32** Oh boy, did I?

**00:56:34** But for me, it's it has been perfect and

**00:56:39** lined up with a bunch of changes that I wanted to make in life anyway.

**00:56:43** And so I feel like I've taken, you know, for a variety of reasons,

**00:56:49** this situation extremely seriously, and that also means like that's part of the

**00:56:54** reason the whole video came out is because it's like, OK, I need to set up these

**00:56:58** spaces, I need to treat exercise like it's mandatory medicine.

**00:57:03** There's just no question about this at all.

**00:57:05** I'm being very strict about like if I'm in my office, I'm working.

**00:57:09** And yeah, it's it's I've been trying to think about how to articulate it.

**00:57:15** But the truth is right now in this little spaceship, I just feel like I'm doing

**00:57:22** really well. And I also have a lot of markers that are

**00:57:25** objective markers that are tracking with that.

**00:57:28** Without a doubt, I'm in the best physical shape of my life.

**00:57:31** And I've got several really interesting,

**00:57:36** really engaging video projects that are in the works in parallel.

**00:57:40** And my wife and I have been spending great quality time together.

**00:57:45** The only place that's a real downside is

**00:57:50** that we don't have any access to private outdoor space.

**00:57:56** And because of my wife's health, we're still being very cautious about going

**00:58:00** outside. And so that is the only thing if I could make

**00:58:05** something be different to improve the situation.

**00:58:08** We should have escaped to the countryside

**00:58:10** years ago so that we could go outside for walks.

**00:58:13** So, you know, my wife and I have been inside

**00:58:19** without leaving the house since the start of this with only for me,

**00:58:23** a couple of rare exceptions for necessary errands and things.

**00:58:27** So that's the only part where I feel like if I could change something,

**00:58:31** I would I would change that.

**00:58:32** Otherwise, I don't know, like I feel really great.

**00:58:35** And there's something psychologically very different about a calendar that

**00:58:40** literally has no items scheduled in the future at all versus a calendar where,

**00:58:47** oh, there's a conference two months from now.

**00:58:49** Like it creates a real feeling of space and freedom and is quite a different way

**00:58:56** to have spent my time over the last couple of months than the original plan.

**00:59:01** But yeah, it like that's a difficult thing to talk about because it makes some people

**00:59:09** really upset if you say like, oh, this is this lockdown has been great for me

**00:59:14** personally. I mean, yes, it's a global economic and personal disaster.

**00:59:19** And, you know, it may very well be a personal disaster for me at some point

**00:59:24** in the future, but like right now, this is fantastic.

**00:59:27** So, yeah, it's just a weird situation to be in.

**00:59:32** But that's the truth of it is I feel like it's been an incredibly

**00:59:36** clarifying and focusing time for me.

**00:59:42** And this and this is also where after saying all that, it always makes me dread

**00:59:46** then being like, how are you doing before before we get to that?

**00:59:51** There's like something I think I've been thinking about recently, like you mentioned

**00:59:55** about like escaping to the country.

**00:59:57** Do you think you would be more likely to move out of London now than before?

**01:00:02** Yeah, yeah, for sure.

**01:00:03** I'm thinking it now like I want a house next, not an apartment.

**01:00:08** Like this has always been something I've wanted anyway.

**01:00:10** Right.

**01:00:11** I want to be able to move into a house.

**01:00:13** And so we haven't made any kind of moves on that.

**01:00:17** We would always have been at least a year or two before we would even have ever

**01:00:21** thought about moving anyway. But I am now more like thinking a garden

**01:00:27** would would be nice right now. Yeah.

**01:00:29** Yeah. And I'm also now thinking right now in my life,

**01:00:34** my proximity to London is not really that helpful.

**01:00:38** Right.

**01:00:38** Like I could be as far away from the centre again and definitely know I would

**01:00:45** still have access to all the modern conveniences.

**01:00:48** Like there are lots of towns in England which would provide me what I want mostly

**01:00:54** for the time that I'm in right now.

**01:00:56** It would add frustrations for like travel,

**01:01:00** but like maybe I don't do as much of that in the future anyway.

**01:01:04** So I am personally thinking like maybe we

**01:01:07** can move further out now than we were expecting before

**01:01:11** because priorities might start to change.

**01:01:12** And it's just not something that I'd really considered.

**01:01:15** Yeah. I was always like we will stay in an

**01:01:17** apartment until we can afford a home in and around the area of London we are already

**01:01:23** in. Right. Yes.

**01:01:24** Yes. I see what you mean.

**01:01:25** But now it might be like, no, maybe we just move like another 30 minutes further out.

**01:01:31** And buy a home.

**01:01:32** Yeah. Right.

**01:01:33** Rather than an apartment.

**01:01:35** One of the things that's really been on my mind is that we don't have a car.

**01:01:40** I've never cared about that before.

**01:01:42** It's never mattered.

**01:01:43** I'm so annoyed that I didn't learn to drive because I've been talking about it

**01:01:48** for years. Right. Yeah.

**01:01:49** And just was like, whatever.

**01:01:51** Like the studio will make me get the car. Right.

**01:01:55** Yeah. If I would have learned to drive

**01:01:58** before now, my life would have been so much easier.

**01:02:01** Yes. Of course.

**01:02:02** So annoying.

**01:02:04** Yeah. Not having a car in a situation where I mean, especially a month ago,

**01:02:09** where it's where it's more like so is it the apocalypse?

**01:02:13** Right. Like you want a car.

**01:02:15** You want options.

**01:02:17** And this is one time where I'm really aware of like, oh, we don't have options.

**01:02:21** We're in this apartment and, you know, my wife hasn't left the front door of our

**01:02:27** apartment and I haven't gone farther than the garbage cans on the street in two months.

**01:02:34** And I'm very aware of that because my parents are quarantining,

**01:02:38** but they also have a car so they can just go for nice country drives.

**01:02:42** Right. And like the car is a mobile part of the bubble.

**01:02:45** You can drive. Why don't you just get a car?

**01:02:47** I can't drive in the UK because I've lived here too long.

**01:02:50** Right. I would need to drive a license.

**01:02:53** I don't have the driver's license.

**01:02:54** And you can't do the swap because it's been too long.

**01:02:57** Yeah. If you're going to be a resident,

**01:02:59** you have to go through the driver's license process.

**01:03:01** If you're a tourist, you can do the like, oh, I can drive in the UK while I'm a tourist.

**01:03:07** But if you if you live here, you can't just swap it over.

**01:03:09** You have to you have to actually go through the schools.

**01:03:12** Is that because you're American?

**01:03:14** I don't know if it's because you're an American.

**01:03:16** I'm pretty sure it's just a general rule.

**01:03:18** That's so annoying, man, because like you can have I'm sure someone can just deliver a car.

**01:03:23** Right. Like I don't know if you have to go to a showroom.

**01:03:25** I don't think you do.

**01:03:27** Yeah. Who cares about the rules?

**01:03:29** Great. Just drive around.

**01:03:31** Just just go for it, man.

**01:03:33** Yeah. What's the worst that could happen?

**01:03:35** Yeah. Yeah.

**01:03:36** Yeah. There's no rules in this new world.

**01:03:38** But yes, I know it's just something that's been on my mind.

**01:03:41** And the lack of outdoor space, like I said, is the only thing that I would change.

**01:03:46** So it's been on my mind.

**01:03:48** But I also think the reason that you're

**01:03:50** thinking the same thing is this is the like the natural lifecycle of urban areas

**01:03:58** and people's careers.

**01:04:00** Right. And so.

**01:04:02** The younger you are, the more advantage there is to moving to the biggest city you

**01:04:08** possibly can at the start of your career, even if I know nothing about a human being.

**01:04:13** That is generically good advice.

**01:04:16** You know, did you just graduate?

**01:04:19** And you've decided that it's time to look for work.

**01:04:22** Like go to the biggest city that you

**01:04:25** reasonably can and it magnifies your potential in a whole bunch of different ways.

**01:04:31** But then as one's career goes on, the advantage of being in that urban core,

**01:04:39** there's like a decreasing marginal value of that.

**01:04:42** And so I think this is why, like you just generally have this cycle of cities suck

**01:04:48** in younger people and then as people progress in their career,

**01:04:53** they've extracted most of the advantages they're going to have for an urban core

**01:04:57** and start to value different kinds of things like I want more space in my house

**01:05:02** and like I'm willing to trade that against other different resources.

**01:05:05** And so I think for you and me, we're both at that point.

**01:05:09** And maybe this moment has just sharpened that thinking a little bit.

**01:05:14** Yeah, it's like having lived in London has been

**01:05:18** tremendously advantageous to my teaching career and my YouTube career in innumerable

**01:05:25** ways, but is that still the case now?

**01:05:29** Like, yes, it is still valuable,

**01:05:33** but not as valuable and as important.

**01:05:36** And so I find myself more willing to think

**01:05:38** about trading it off against other things that I would want.

**01:05:42** So, yeah, I don't know.

**01:05:42** It's just something that's been on my mind.

**01:05:45** But how are you doing?

**01:05:46** I would say that, like, I'm not doing as well as you.

**01:05:50** Like, I'm not doing badly, but like I'm in the middle,

**01:05:57** but with various fluctuations on that scale, depending on the area that you're

**01:06:01** looking at, what do you mean by that?

**01:06:03** Well, so like, OK, let's talk about exercise, right?

**01:06:07** I'm doing more of it, but I still hate it.

**01:06:11** And.

**01:06:13** Everything I'm doing just hurts me.

**01:06:17** Like, I just I don't know what it is about me, Gray, but like,

**01:06:21** I'm not getting injured, but just like it doesn't matter what it is.

**01:06:25** But my body just hates it.

**01:06:27** What are you doing?

**01:06:28** Well, a mixture of either yoga or bodyweight exercises.

**01:06:35** But like, if I do yoga, I hurt for the rest of the day.

**01:06:38** Like, it's just like, whatever.

**01:06:40** This is the thing I'm going to see some I'm going to go see a specialist after all

**01:06:44** this is taken care of, because like this has always been a problem in my life.

**01:06:48** And I'm not looking for a diagnosis on the podcast, but like there are various

**01:06:53** conditions that can be conducive to this, just like joints and stuff like that.

**01:06:57** Right. Like maybe I'm just not built for this, but whatever.

**01:07:00** Anyway, so exercise is like I'm doing it, but I hate it.

**01:07:04** And I don't feel any benefit from it.

**01:07:07** But like, that's just a part of my life that's always been there anyway.

**01:07:11** But I'm still doing it.

**01:07:12** For some elements me, there isn't that much of a change.

**01:07:15** Like I relax about as much as I did before, sometimes more, sometimes less.

**01:07:19** But it's dictated by my week because the amount of like structured events that I'm

**01:07:24** doing is still the same because I worked from home before I worked from home for

**01:07:29** nearly six years and my life has this structure to it which hasn't changed.

**01:07:33** Yeah. I was going to say, like your podcast

**01:07:35** recording schedule hasn't significantly changed, has it? No, no, it hasn't at all.

**01:07:40** OK, I'm having more meetings than I've ever had before, like appointments,

**01:07:45** like calls, whatever. So I have more in my diary.

**01:07:49** Plus.

**01:07:51** I am working harder right now than I have worked in years because producing content

**01:07:57** and trying to keep everything together is taking more work than it usually does,

**01:08:02** because things are different right now.

**01:08:05** You have the problem that all content trends in one direction right now.

**01:08:12** There's like there's a little bit of Corona flavor in every topic.

**01:08:17** Right. Yeah.

**01:08:19** And so if you want to go down those

**01:08:23** routes, you can and that's one element of hard work or you can try and avoid it.

**01:08:29** And that's also hard work.

**01:08:31** Right. So like doing that and then also just running running

**01:08:35** any business of any size, just inherently more difficult right now.

**01:08:42** Yeah, I would say that's that's a trend I definitely notice among my friends is

**01:08:48** people who run businesses are having significantly more difficult time than

**01:08:53** people who don't. And it's not even if anything's going wrong.

**01:08:57** The fear of is that everything's fine now.

**01:09:00** But what if it isn't in a month?

**01:09:02** Right. And it's just a lot to carry around

**01:09:04** with you, especially when like, unlike most instances, some of this stuff can be

**01:09:10** completely unrelated to your own performance.

**01:09:13** It's just a lot to carry around.

**01:09:15** Right. Like that just makes things difficult.

**01:09:18** We've been talking about this a little bit and we'll have more to share in the future.

**01:09:21** Like Relay FM, my company, we're taking this as a time to change a bit about who we

**01:09:29** are and where our focus as a company is.

**01:09:32** That takes a lot of work to do.

**01:09:35** Right. Like if you've decided that you want

**01:09:37** to adapt your business model to something a bit different, like that's a lot.

**01:09:43** That's hard work. Right.

**01:09:44** So there's been a I've got a lot going on.

**01:09:49** Which is adding a lot to everything.

**01:09:51** Right.

**01:09:52** Like I'm not sleeping as well right now because my brain doesn't stop working.

**01:09:58** I don't really see it as a downside because

**01:10:01** I have a lot of really great ideas when I can't sleep at two thirty.

**01:10:04** Like my brain clarifies on things.

**01:10:08** You know, I'm not trying to stay awake, but like I'm just laying there and my brain

**01:10:12** just go in and go in and go in and then bang.

**01:10:15** There it is. I did it.

**01:10:16** This is not normal for a lot of people.

**01:10:18** A lot of people will tell you that this is a terrible time to have ideas.

**01:10:22** But for me, it works.

**01:10:24** You know, I hear a lot of people say that they're struggling with a problem.

**01:10:28** They wake up the next one and they've solved it.

**01:10:31** That doesn't happen to me.

**01:10:32** What happens to me is before I fall asleep, it's solved.

**01:10:35** Right. So like when I'm trying to get my brain to shut down,

**01:10:39** that's sometimes where things pop out like that's just a way that I am.

**01:10:44** That's where I've been for years.

**01:10:45** That sounds terrible, but I'm glad it works for you.

**01:10:48** Look, it's I would sometimes wish I could go to sleep.

**01:10:51** But if I can't sleep, at least if I get some benefit out of that, I'm happy.

**01:10:55** Right. Yeah.

**01:10:56** I prefer this to just laying there and worrying.

**01:10:59** It's not worry.

**01:11:00** It's like I'm coming up with ideas that are happening to me then.

**01:11:05** So, yeah, it's like every day is a different feeling.

**01:11:10** Yeah. But on the whole, I'm just really busy right now.

**01:11:16** And so that's tiring.

**01:11:17** But I will say I'm a man who loves travel.

**01:11:20** Right.

**01:11:22** I love to travel.

**01:11:24** I get to spend time with people that I care about.

**01:11:26** I get to go to places.

**01:11:28** I get to go to restaurants, which I enjoy and experience new things.

**01:11:33** But in a similar vein to you,

**01:11:35** the amount of quality time that me and my wife, Adina, are getting to spend

**01:11:39** together right now is unlike what we have had over the last few years.

**01:11:45** And I am enjoying that.

**01:11:47** That like we are getting to spend this time together.

**01:11:51** If I can't do that one thing, this is a really great thing to replace it.

**01:11:55** Because I am missing traveling.

**01:11:58** You know, I know that it causes so much stress in our lives.

**01:12:04** Right. Like to go to America and spend a

**01:12:07** week and come back and you've lost three weeks.

**01:12:09** Right. Like it's very disruptive.

**01:12:13** But I love it.

**01:12:14** Right. And so I'm missing that.

**01:12:17** Like that is the the main thing that I'm

**01:12:19** missing in my life right now is getting able to able to do that stuff.

**01:12:23** Everything else I can handle a lot better, but I am missing that.

**01:12:28** I'll sympathize with you on the travel in

**01:12:31** perhaps the weirdest and most unsympathetic way.

**01:12:34** I do find myself thinking sometimes, oh, I'll be glad to travel again so that I can

**01:12:40** do a great cation where I can go somewhere and just be completely alone and lock

**01:12:45** myself in a hotel room for a week.

**01:12:47** No, but that's nice, though.

**01:12:48** Like one of the things that I would like about traveling sometimes is I had time

**01:12:52** to just decompress.

**01:12:55** It became such a part of my life over the last five years.

**01:12:59** It has been the biggest thing that I have noticed.

**01:13:02** Yeah, your travel really has ramped up a lot since we first got to know each other.

**01:13:07** I feel like you hardly did any travel at the beginning.

**01:13:10** It got to the point where I was like in

**01:13:11** America basically every four to five weeks.

**01:13:14** Yeah. Which is which is madness is absolute

**01:13:17** madness. It's been a big shift and I know as time goes on,

**01:13:21** I'm only going to feel it more that I've not been anywhere.

**01:13:25** Like, you know, I like to travel.

**01:13:27** I'm like so happy that we got in one great trip in January,

**01:13:33** right, where we went to L.A., we had a wonderful time and we did a bunch of really

**01:13:39** fun things and I'm very happy we got that trip.

**01:13:42** It was like a trip of a lifetime for me.

**01:13:44** It's something like I ticked off a bunch

**01:13:45** of boxes of things that I always wanted to do.

**01:13:47** And then that was it.

**01:13:48** Can I make an exercise suggestion for you, Mike?

**01:13:50** Yes, I know. I know you won't like it.

**01:13:53** Right. I know you won't like it.

**01:13:54** I've very strongly suggest

**01:13:58** you get a set of adjustable dumbbells so that you can do some actual weight training.

**01:14:06** OK, OK. Don't get me wrong.

**01:14:09** I'm not saying that you'll like it.

**01:14:11** I'm not saying that it won't hurt.

**01:14:15** Like, you know, you'll feel the burn.

**01:14:17** But this is this is for anyone who's trying to exercise at home.

**01:14:24** This is a place to start.

**01:14:27** Even if or especially if you think like, oh, lifting weights, it's it's not for me.

**01:14:35** I'm just going to I'm going to very strongly suggest it because it's an area

**01:14:41** where you can see relatively quick progress.

**01:14:46** And in many ways, you can start off

**01:14:50** on a much easier level than trying to do some of the bodyweight exercises.

**01:14:55** Like bodyweight exercises are totally fine when you don't have other equipment,

**01:15:01** but especially if like your fitness level is not particularly high,

**01:15:07** starting with weights, I think, is actually better because you can do

**01:15:10** some motions with like this is a two and a half pound weight and I'm just lifting it

**01:15:15** and it feels like nothing and you just slowly increase that over time.

**01:15:19** So I'm going to strongly suggest that you give it a try and put it in your rotation

**01:15:24** because I feel like for me, it is the most sanity keeping part of the physical routine.

**01:15:30** And like I just happened to as the very end of the year of order.

**01:15:35** We never got around to it.

**01:15:36** I had it as like this follow up note for weeks and weeks.

**01:15:39** But the very end of the year of order was I did get just like a very small set of

**01:15:43** dumbbells for the home just so that I could like do a little bit of exercise

**01:15:48** if I didn't have time to go to the gym like that by far and away is one of the best

**01:15:54** purchases and one of the most helpful quarantine items that I have.

**01:15:59** You may be resistant to it, but I would give it a try.

**01:16:02** It seems difficult to find adjustable dumbbells right now.

**01:16:06** Like look, here's the thing.

**01:16:07** This is a long term situation here.

**01:16:10** I would put in some orders and see what arrives.

**01:16:12** Do you have any recommendations you can send me or shall I just find something?

**01:16:17** I do have a recommendation.

**01:16:19** Let me just get the name.

**01:16:20** Can you feel how much I hate this like coming through the microphone?

**01:16:24** Oh, yeah, no, I can.

**01:16:25** I can 100 percent feel how much you hate this.

**01:16:28** OK, good. I just want to make sure

**01:16:30** that you know.

**01:16:32** Look, I know.

**01:16:34** I totally know.

**01:16:35** I'm just like trying to cast my mind back in time would be one of the much more

**01:16:41** unexpected things if I were to to have a conversation with a younger self and be

**01:16:46** like, hey, man, you're going to spend the next 10 years trying to figure out how to

**01:16:50** not hate exercise. And the answer is going to end up being weightlifting.

**01:16:56** And you like this is going to be completely unexpected across every front.

**01:17:01** But just save yourself a bunch of time and do this.

**01:17:04** And also it seems to have a much higher hit rate than I would expect

**01:17:11** with other people that I'm trying to like that I've tried to convince to do the same

**01:17:14** thing. It's like if you can do it a little bit,

**01:17:17** it has it seems to have a much higher sticking rate than other kinds of things

**01:17:21** like running or whatever.

**01:17:23** OK, but so look, here's the ones that I like and I think are really nice.

**01:17:28** I'm going to send them to you.

**01:17:29** They're called Power Block and just try to put in your order before the show goes up.

**01:17:34** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**01:17:35** Yeah, my order will be in before the show notes go out to people.

**01:17:39** Right.

**01:17:40** These are the kind where they're like they're super compact and you can change

**01:17:43** the weights really easily.

**01:17:44** There's a bunch of adjustable dumbbells, but if you can't get adjustable ones,

**01:17:48** just get a little length light set of dumbbells.

**01:17:50** Get something. These are the ones that I really like.

**01:17:53** And I strongly suggest you and any of the listeners who are having a hard time

**01:17:58** with exercise. Try this.

**01:18:39** It is easy to see why Hova is the popular choice for people starting businesses.

**01:18:43** One of my favorite things about Hova is I can go from, oh,

**01:18:46** that's a good domain name to having it registered and forwarded to somewhere else

**01:18:50** in like a minute. This is my favorite thing about it.

**01:18:52** I go to hover.com.

**01:18:54** I search what I need and then I can register it.

**01:18:56** I also really like that you can adapt the search really easily so you can get a

**01:18:59** couple of different names for that domain name that you're looking for.

**01:19:02** And I also love that it's super easy that once you've registered that domain name

**01:19:05** to forward it to where you need it to go, super awesome.

**01:19:08** I love how easy it is to also integrate with other services.

**01:19:11** Hova is the best.

**01:19:12** I know that you love great user experiences.

**01:19:15** I think that's the type of thing that's typical to people that listen to this show.

**01:19:18** You want stuff that's going to work straight out of the box.

**01:19:20** That's why I know you're going to love Hova.

**01:19:22** There are over 400 TODs and they're like the dot something names, right?

**01:19:26** That Hova has to offer one that stands out right now is dot art,

**01:19:30** especially if you're an artist, maybe you want to create a website to showcase your

**01:19:33** work. I bet you can get what you're looking for with a dot art domain.

**01:19:37** You can get a custom domain name for each individual piece of art that you create.

**01:19:40** It could act as a sort of catalog that provides descriptions details on each

**01:19:45** piece and makes your work accessible and stand out from the crowd.

**01:19:49** Buy your domain right now and start using it today by going to hover.com slash

**01:19:56** That's hover.com slash cortex to get that 10 percent discount on new purchases.

**01:20:02** Make a name for yourself with hover.

**01:20:04** Thanks to hover for their support of this show and relay FM.

**01:20:08** I mean, the other way that you can exercise is in VR, Mike.

**01:20:10** It's not quite the same as weightlifting, but, you know,

**01:20:12** you can get your part of the way there.

**01:20:14** I have some fun follow up.

**01:20:16** I was able to get an Oculus Quest.

**01:20:18** Oh, wow. OK. Yeah.

**01:20:19** They came into stock and I got one immediately.

**01:20:22** It's a completely different experience.

**01:20:23** If you think you've experienced VR, you haven't until you've experienced

**01:20:27** completely wireless VR. Great.

**01:20:30** You too have heard the good news about no wires.

**01:20:33** This is everyone's response. It's more than no wires as well.

**01:20:37** It's like I don't have to turn the computer on.

**01:20:40** And it really helps you just because it's just on the kitchen table.

**01:20:44** I just pick it up, put it on and I can play a game.

**01:20:47** Yeah, I have been playing four games quite a bit

**01:20:51** that I wanted to talk about.

**01:20:53** One of them is like we spoke about Beat Saber before.

**01:20:57** One thing we didn't talk about is Beat Saber's 360 degree levels.

**01:21:02** Well, we didn't talk about it because I didn't know that this wasn't a thing

**01:21:06** on the other headsets that didn't occur to me to bring it up.

**01:21:08** I don't know if it's on the other headsets.

**01:21:11** But when I played the game a bunch the first time, these levels didn't exist.

**01:21:16** It was just like straight on.

**01:21:18** OK, but this completely changes the game

**01:21:20** in a bunch of really fun ways that the you're not just looking at like a conveyor

**01:21:27** about coming straight at you that could be coming from any direction.

**01:21:30** And you have to keep on top of that.

**01:21:32** That is a very different way to play Beat Saber, which is much more fun.

**01:21:35** I think the optimal experience is the 90 degree one.

**01:21:39** Oh, yeah. But the 360 degree ones are fun.

**01:21:41** But like the 90 degree ones are 90 or 180, I think, is another option.

**01:21:46** Like it's easier to play those.

**01:21:48** Yeah, I feel like they combine enough.

**01:21:51** Oh, you got to look around for where the blocks are coming from.

**01:21:54** You don't know without it being like it's going to hit you from behind.

**01:21:57** All right. Yeah. 360 is like a completely different game.

**01:22:00** I found another game which is kind of similar, but I prefer it's called Pistol Whip.

**01:22:06** Which is a rhythm based shooting game.

**01:22:10** And I think this game is fantastic.

**01:22:13** It's exhilarating and challenging.

**01:22:16** How would you describe Pistol Whip?

**01:22:18** You are moving forward and you're in like these living target ranges basically

**01:22:24** and human shaped figures come at you and you have to shoot them.

**01:22:30** But it has the aesthetic that many VR games have of like this is a simulation,

**01:22:36** which is way more comfortable feeling for a shooting game than this is real.

**01:22:41** Right. Makes you feel different about the things that you shoot.

**01:22:44** And I think I think that works really nicely.

**01:22:46** I like that kind of idea.

**01:22:47** So still haven't tried Arizona Sunshine that.

**01:22:50** Not yet.

**01:22:51** Not yet.

**01:22:52** I will, but just not yet.

**01:22:55** I need all of the moons to align before I try that game.

**01:22:59** I really like Pistol Whip because the songs are really good and the enemies are

**01:23:04** coming at you in a way that you can shoot them in time to a rhythm, which is very fun.

**01:23:10** And some of the levels surprise you in different ways.

**01:23:15** It is a very fun rhythm based shooting game.

**01:23:19** I think it's great.

**01:23:20** Yeah, you recommended it to me.

**01:23:22** So I tried it and I didn't like it the first time, but that's partly because I was

**01:23:27** having some motion sickness issues with it.

**01:23:30** It takes a bit of getting used to because you are moving.

**01:23:33** Not a lot of VR games move you, but this one moves you forward through the levels.

**01:23:38** Yeah, well, it's such an interesting way that the different systems try to handle

**01:23:43** the motion. And as I've been just trying out different games,

**01:23:47** it's interesting to see what different things do.

**01:23:50** But Pistol Whip was one of the very first ones that I had tried.

**01:23:53** And I was like, whoa, I cannot deal with this.

**01:23:56** But I revisited it because you had mentioned it again for some reason.

**01:23:59** I can't remember why.

**01:24:00** I just texted you and told you that it was

**01:24:02** incredible and you had to try it if you haven't.

**01:24:04** Right. Right. OK.

**01:24:05** And so I I gave it a second try and I liked it much better for a couple of reasons.

**01:24:11** One of the reasons is I think it's a similar effect to like when I first started

**01:24:16** watching YouTube videos, I couldn't deal with the vlog style of filming where

**01:24:22** like the way that the camera bounces and is kind of jerky.

**01:24:25** At some point, having just watched a bunch

**01:24:28** of vlog videos, my brain just adapted to this.

**01:24:31** It's like, OK, I can watch this.

**01:24:33** I can watch just a handheld camera in a way that I couldn't before.

**01:24:37** And I just don't even notice it really.

**01:24:39** And I think having done a bunch of the different VR games,

**01:24:44** I came to the Pistol Whip with the same experience of,

**01:24:48** oh, my brain has learned a little bit better how to handle this.

**01:24:51** It's like getting sea legs.

**01:24:53** I genuinely think it's a good analogy.

**01:24:56** You got your VR legs.

**01:24:57** Yeah. It's funny how much the video games,

**01:25:00** like conceptual framing helps your brain.

**01:25:03** So in Pistol Whip, you are standing on a little platform and it's the platform

**01:25:08** that's moving, it's not you just flying forward in space.

**01:25:12** And it's like, but something about just looking down and seeing the platform

**01:25:16** for a second, it's like it lets your brain go, OK, it's fine.

**01:25:19** We're we're we're moving forward on a platform.

**01:25:22** We're not just flying through space and I don't need to freak out about what the

**01:25:26** heck is happening.

**01:25:27** I also if people are going to try Pistol Whip,

**01:25:30** I recommend I didn't realize there are a million settings for changing how stuff

**01:25:36** operates. I think you are about to recommend exactly what I'm about to recommend.

**01:25:40** But carry on. OK, so I'm going to recommend you want to do dual wielding.

**01:25:44** Yes, because it's much more fun, much better.

**01:25:47** And I'm going to recommend the Deadeye setting,

**01:25:49** which takes off like babies first auto aimer for adding targets.

**01:25:54** OK, those are my two suggestions, because the the first time I played it as well,

**01:25:59** they're like aim assist was way too strong for me.

**01:26:02** I felt like it was impossible to not hit the target.

**01:26:04** Not enough of a challenge.

**01:26:06** Yeah, yeah, I just felt like it's not or I should rephrase that.

**01:26:09** It's not that it wasn't enough of a challenge.

**01:26:11** It was more like it's too obvious that the system is really helping me out here.

**01:26:17** Right. So so those are my suggestions,

**01:26:19** like dual wielding because dual wielding is fun.

**01:26:22** And I would say turn on Deadeye, which which removes the aim assist.

**01:26:27** But what was going to be your suggestion?

**01:26:29** I was mostly going to say just dual wield.

**01:26:32** Yeah, because the Deadeye I've turned I turn on and off sometimes.

**01:26:34** It depends on what I'm what I'm looking for in that moment from the game.

**01:26:38** Yeah, what you're in the mood for.

**01:26:39** Yeah. Do I want to be precise or do I just want to move around?

**01:26:43** You know, yeah, I will.

**01:26:45** I will say that the aesthetic in pistol whip is great for people in the know.

**01:26:49** It's very much like the opening scene of lawnmower man, which is right up my alley.

**01:26:54** But it's also it's also something I wish more of the VR

**01:26:59** developers would do is guys like don't try to make it look real.

**01:27:04** I much prefer the games for the most part that lean into the like the vector style

**01:27:10** artwork, super hot, really. Yes, super, super hot.

**01:27:14** Yeah. Pistol whip is like a mixture of super hot and beat saber to me.

**01:27:18** Like that's kind of how it feels.

**01:27:20** Yeah, that's a great way to describe it.

**01:27:21** It's a it's a really good cross between those two.

**01:27:24** But I just like it's it's been interesting

**01:27:26** having tried a ton of games is I'm very aware of like the more abstract stuff

**01:27:33** just works much better and I'm not a big fan of most of the games where they're

**01:27:38** trying to make it look super real. It's like, no, guys, lean into the limitations.

**01:27:42** Except for Arizona Sunshine, right?

**01:27:44** Yeah, I like Arizona Sunshine.

**01:27:46** But for the most part, like, guys, you don't need to make a tree that you're

**01:27:49** trying to make look like a tree.

**01:27:50** I'm perfectly fine with a circular triangular pyramid on on top of a cylinder

**01:27:56** and you just color one green and one brown.

**01:27:58** Like I can go with that.

**01:28:00** I think these are the difference.

**01:28:01** This is like the main difference between VR gaming and non VR gaming.

**01:28:05** Non VR gaming, the more real it looks, the more engaging it is.

**01:28:09** VR gaming, you don't need visuals to make it engaging.

**01:28:14** Yeah, like just make the mechanics work

**01:28:17** because you just accept the world you're in immediately.

**01:28:20** If the physics are good and the mechanics work well, you just accept it.

**01:28:24** So it doesn't need to be photo realistic for me to believe that I'm there.

**01:28:28** Yes, yeah, that's exactly right.

**01:28:31** Like your brain, because they're objects, is just willing to go along with it

**01:28:34** in a way that you don't need to be tricked that it looks real.

**01:28:38** And I wish developers would spend less time trying to make stuff look real

**01:28:42** because it's like it's still not quite there yet.

**01:28:44** And it just doesn't it just doesn't need to be.

**01:28:47** But so that is also partly why I like the aesthetic for pistol whip.

**01:28:50** They're not trying to make it look real and it's totally fine.

**01:28:55** I was glad that you poked me again about

**01:28:57** that one because I did enjoy it much better after I think my brain was a little

**01:29:01** bit more used to the motion, except the only thing I have to be careful about is

**01:29:06** every once in a while, if I take a step backward for some reason,

**01:29:10** that that still throws my brain way off of like, what's what the hell is happening?

**01:29:14** Like if I take a step back, where it's like something about the physics doesn't work.

**01:29:19** So I try to make sure it's like forward only backward.

**01:29:23** No.

**01:29:24** Interesting.

**01:29:25** Have you come across Ordeka? No, I haven't.

**01:29:29** It is a rhythm game made by Harmonics, which is the company that made Rock Band.

**01:29:35** OK, this is the most comprehensive, best made rhythm game I've come across in VR.

**01:29:41** OK.

**01:29:42** Because it's made by like the rhythm game people.

**01:29:45** It is complex.

**01:29:48** Like there is a lot of stuff going on.

**01:29:50** You have like sometimes you shoot in, sometimes you're holding, sometimes you're

**01:29:54** hitting things out of the sky and you kind of have to like Rock Band.

**01:29:59** There are like different shapes and you have to understand what you are

**01:30:04** supposed to do based on the shape and they have real license to music.

**01:30:10** And it's fantastic.

**01:30:11** OK, I'll check it out.

**01:30:12** It's just like mechanically, it's done so well.

**01:30:16** It's like, oh, I feel really good when I'm getting this right.

**01:30:19** Just like when I used to feel really good when I was getting Rock Band, right?

**01:30:23** Like in a way that Beat Saber is satisfying when you are doing a good job.

**01:30:29** But I don't really feel accomplished.

**01:30:32** But in Ordeka, I feel accomplished because I'll play a level and I'll play it again.

**01:30:37** And I'm better at it.

**01:30:38** Play it again and I'm better at it.

**01:30:40** And like it's that repetition of getting better and better that harmonics know how

**01:30:45** to do really well. And it is really, really excellent.

**01:30:50** Like if you have played any type of rhythm

**01:30:52** game on VR and enjoyed it, I really recommend this one.

**01:30:56** And I also found a pottery game.

**01:30:58** I saw the pottery game in the store and I had this moment of I should probably tell

**01:31:02** Mike about that. But then I thought there's no way he doesn't know already.

**01:31:06** I just turned on my Oculus One thing.

**01:31:08** I was like, oh, my God, it's a pottery game.

**01:31:10** And like it's not pottery.

**01:31:13** It isn't right, but it's like close in some ways.

**01:31:15** And it's it's fun and weird.

**01:31:19** It's it's trying to be realistic in some ways.

**01:31:22** Right. Like it's not trying to be like a weird VR game.

**01:31:26** I enjoy it. Like I love it.

**01:31:28** I don't love it anywhere close to the way that I love the other games that I've

**01:31:32** mentioned, but it was just like a really funny thing to happen to me.

**01:31:35** I was like so excited when I saw it and I played it.

**01:31:37** And I was like, you know what?

**01:31:39** Pottery VR game, you're very calming.

**01:31:41** So I appreciate that about you.

**01:31:44** I'm glad you do.

**01:31:46** There's all these interesting VR experiences that can be had.

**01:31:49** And, you know, it's funny because when you mentioned before about how there's no

**01:31:53** there's no substitute for travel, I was thinking a little bit about the VR

**01:31:58** systems because.

**01:32:01** You know, I have I've genuinely found the quest to be a great tool

**01:32:06** for creating the experience of being in another space.

**01:32:12** I really think it has been meaningfully helpful, especially without the ability

**01:32:17** to go outside to be able to use the quest.

**01:32:20** And I do have it kind of slotted into my

**01:32:24** schedule of like exercise rotation, because I think it is useful to do this

**01:32:29** on a regular basis. It's just it's very interesting how your

**01:32:33** brain is willing to go along with it.

**01:32:35** And ever since we did that demo years ago, this is one technology where I feel like

**01:32:40** I'm really excited to see the future of this.

**01:32:44** And speaking of like going back to the start of the show, but speaking of the

**01:32:48** physical distances in places, it's like, man, I am gunning for the day that I can

**01:32:55** do work in a VR environment, like for for when the headsets get light enough

**01:33:00** and comfortable enough and the resolution gets high enough so that text is sharp.

**01:33:05** Even just in the quest, some of those those loading environments where you're

**01:33:10** just picking what game you want to play, but they put you in like, oh, you're in a

**01:33:14** little Japanese house and and the lotus flowers are falling.

**01:33:19** Like it's so beautiful.

**01:33:22** And I really have this strong feeling of if I could,

**01:33:27** I would totally write in this geodesic dome 100 percent.

**01:33:33** I would do that, but the technology just isn't there yet.

**01:33:37** But, you know, like when using these, it's going to get there.

**01:33:40** Right. Like you can feel. Yeah.

**01:33:41** Right. Like it's.

**01:33:42** That's that's what I mean by I'm excited about this because it's like, OK,

**01:33:46** in a couple of generations, if we can cut down the weight of the headset by half

**01:33:53** and if, say, the resolution can increase by double or four times, like we can get

**01:33:59** there and it's going to go there.

**01:34:00** So I find myself really quite excited for that.

**01:34:03** I know and can see like I will use something like this as a working environment

**01:34:11** at some point in the future for sure.

**01:34:14** Like there is no doubt about that in my mind.

**01:34:16** And I just like I look forward to that to that becoming reality at some point.

**01:34:20** What I will say is for me, like it is a replacement for outside.

**01:34:26** It's not a replacement for travel.

**01:34:27** Right. OK, yeah, that's a good way to put it.

**01:34:30** That's a good way to put it.

**01:34:31** I can feel that like, oh, I did a thing today.

**01:34:34** Like that thing could have been going to the park.

**01:34:37** It's not like I've been out of the country for 10 days.

**01:34:40** Like it doesn't. It's not that level.

**01:34:42** So I don't think I could do VR for 10 days.

**01:34:45** Yeah, no, no, no.

**01:34:46** I'm not saying I want to take a great case in VR yet.

**01:34:50** Yeah, yeah, you are. You want to do that.

**01:34:52** Don't say you don't want to do that. You do.

**01:34:53** That's more like 20 years from now.

**01:34:55** But yeah, for sure.

**01:34:57** And look, I know you've played Animal Crossing.

**01:35:00** I watched the stream.

**01:35:02** It went exactly as I expected.

**01:35:04** For some reason, people think that I wanted you to play when I explicitly said

**01:35:08** I didn't want you to play this game.

**01:35:10** I know. I know.

**01:35:11** I asked I asked if I should try it and you said, yes, that's that's the way

**01:35:15** that went. Well, I didn't want you to play it because I knew how you were going to.

**01:35:19** OK, maybe it was like I said you should try it, but I knew how it was going to go.

**01:35:23** I wasn't surprised about the fact that you hated this game.

**01:35:27** Right. I knew you were going to hate it.

**01:35:29** Yeah, no, I mean, we don't we don't need to discuss it in detail.

**01:35:32** But the evidence is the evidence is there for people.

**01:35:35** I didn't expect to like the game and I was correct.

**01:35:39** One could suggest that you went into it negatively.

**01:35:43** One could suggest that you were not in the correct space to play the game when you went at it.

**01:35:49** You know, that is totally fair.

**01:35:52** But the thing is Animal Crossing annoyed me in all sorts of ways that I wasn't expecting.

**01:35:57** Right. So I think even under the most ideal of circumstances,

**01:36:01** there is no way that I would like this game.

**01:36:03** But it's like I had expectations to be annoyed and I was annoyed in ways that I was

**01:36:08** completely blindsided by.

**01:36:09** This is not Animal Crossing specific.

**01:36:11** I think this is a kind of Nintendo disease.

**01:36:14** Nintendo likes to take things slow sometimes like in there and all of the Nintendo first party games.

**01:36:22** They're real chill about dialog boxes and you're selecting a racing track for Mario Kart.

**01:36:30** And, you know, hey, guys, don't you just want to watch this spin or spin for a while?

**01:36:33** No, I don't like I want to pick a course and go.

**01:36:37** I have a way to describe Nintendo Nintendo's development.

**01:36:40** It's painful charm.

**01:36:42** That tends to be the way the Nintendo makes their games.

**01:36:45** They're like they're charming and they do things in the way that they do them.

**01:36:48** But sometimes it's really painful.

**01:36:50** Like with Animal Crossing, it's that everything runs in real time.

**01:36:53** I like that it runs in real time, but sometimes it's like, geez, Tom,

**01:36:57** look, will you just destroy the bridge right now?

**01:36:59** Why is it going to take you a day to destroy the bridge, Tom?

**01:37:02** I don't know. It's going to be tomorrow.

**01:37:07** Yeah, like so that is a Nintendo disease.

**01:37:10** And I think Animal Crossing may be its most pure expression.

**01:37:15** I am glad I at least played it for a little bit.

**01:37:19** So I have had a bit more of a like a firsthand experience of what this was.

**01:37:23** But yeah, I very quickly realized, like, you know what I don't want to do?

**01:37:26** I don't want to press a 20,000 times over the course of many hours to accomplish

**01:37:32** things, so I'm going to bail on this, but I'm glad I tried it.

**01:37:36** I'm glad I tried it.
