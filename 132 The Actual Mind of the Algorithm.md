# Cortex - 132: The Actual Mind of the Algorithm
**00:00:00** I have a microphone question for you, I guess,

**00:00:02** while we're setting up here.

**00:00:03** Perfect time.

**00:00:03** Do you put the microphone angled down towards your face

**00:00:07** or angled up towards your face?

**00:00:09** I have it angled up towards my face.

**00:00:11** Okay, what's the reasoning for that?

**00:00:13** Because then I can see my monitor more clearly.

**00:00:16** Okay, so it's just about your field of view.

**00:00:19** Yeah.

**00:00:20** Right, okay.

**00:00:21** I mean, really, the answer to that question

**00:00:22** is depends on the microphone you have

**00:00:24** if you're thinking of like,

**00:00:25** what is the optimal way to talk into the microphone, right?

**00:00:29** Because some microphones, you talk into them directly.

**00:00:32** Some you talk into the side.

**00:00:33** It depends where the actual microphone

**00:00:36** is within the housing, you know?

**00:00:38** Okay, so let's say you have a Shure SM58.

**00:00:43** Are you supposed to talk into that one directly

**00:00:45** or is that okay to have up or down?

**00:00:47** How would you even know that?

**00:00:48** Well, the Shure SM58,

**00:00:50** that's the one that looks like a vocal microphone, right?

**00:00:52** Yes, yeah.

**00:00:53** So that's easy, you talk into the top of it.

**00:00:56** But then you get plosives, right?

**00:00:57** That's the problem.

**00:00:58** You're supposed to have a windscreen on it,

**00:01:00** which I could hear.

**00:01:00** I heard the little foam.

**00:01:02** Right, you heard me adjusting the foam.

**00:01:04** That's what you said.

**00:01:05** Yeah, so that will reduce the plosives.

**00:01:07** Yeah, but it doesn't.

**00:01:09** Like this is what everyone always says, it doesn't.

**00:01:11** They're like, oh, you get a windscreen

**00:01:13** and a thing to put on top of the microphone

**00:01:15** and then there's no more plosives, but that's a lie.

**00:01:17** No more, no one said, I didn't say no more, did I?

**00:01:21** Very specifically said reduced, right?

**00:01:25** But the thing is, if you don't talk into the top

**00:01:27** of the microphone, then you're not talking

**00:01:28** into the microphone, so then you're off mic.

**00:01:31** Right, I don't know, like.

**00:01:33** Right?

**00:01:36** Right.

**00:01:37** So like, look, I can talk into the side

**00:01:39** of my microphone right now, but that's no good, is it?

**00:01:41** Right, because you can't hear me anymore?

**00:01:42** No, that doesn't sound good at all.

**00:01:44** So you've got to balance it, like, yeah,

**00:01:45** there's gonna be a little bit of plosives,

**00:01:47** but like, we can manage it.

**00:01:48** No, but I don't want any plosives, right?

**00:01:51** Okay.

**00:01:52** So I was thinking for the, well, for the, okay,

**00:01:55** the reason I was asking is because

**00:01:56** when I recorded the audio for the video

**00:01:59** that just went up, I was like, oh my God,

**00:02:01** I have a genius idea.

**00:02:03** Instead of talking into the microphone,

**00:02:06** like I see people on YouTube and they put the microphone

**00:02:08** below them or some of them put them at above,

**00:02:11** and I was like, oh, they must do that

**00:02:13** so that they don't get plosives.

**00:02:15** They don't have plosives when they do that.

**00:02:16** Okay, well, there's a couple of reasons.

**00:02:18** One, because now they're practicing bad microphone technique.

**00:02:21** So like, they have to turn up the game on their audio.

**00:02:27** So they can make sure that they get it all in there probably,

**00:02:30** which is gonna expose more room noise,

**00:02:31** which is not good for an audio only podcast.

**00:02:34** People are more forgiving of this stuff on video.

**00:02:36** And they're not doing it because of the plosives.

**00:02:38** They're doing it so microphones in front of their face

**00:02:41** because they're filming themselves.

**00:02:42** Oh, I didn't consider that, okay.

**00:02:46** That didn't really cross my mind, but yes, okay.

**00:02:50** Everyone's not like, oh, we must eradicate plosives

**00:02:53** from audio.

**00:02:54** Let's put the microphone on the other side of the room.

**00:02:57** Yeah, that's what I thought they were doing.

**00:02:58** I guess not.

**00:02:59** No, it's just so it's not in front of their face.

**00:03:03** There are some microphones where like,

**00:03:05** you kind of talk over them a little bit

**00:03:07** and that can reduce it,

**00:03:09** but you've got to then have the right kind of microphone

**00:03:11** for that, and I'll be honest,

**00:03:12** I'm not sure what the SM58 is like for that.

**00:03:15** Now I know in the microphone that I own,

**00:03:17** which is a microphone I know that you bought,

**00:03:19** but we can never find any evidence of it.

**00:03:21** Because I didn't buy that.

**00:03:22** So I'm in KMS 105,

**00:03:24** you are supposed to talk directly into it.

**00:03:26** So there is a little bit of mic technique

**00:03:29** that you have to do to try and reduce the plosives,

**00:03:31** but I'm not gonna.

**00:03:32** Okay, no, but like-

**00:03:33** By the way, in case people don't know what plosives are,

**00:03:35** it's like, I'm gonna remove my windshield

**00:03:37** so you can hear one.

**00:03:38** Peter Piper picked the best.

**00:03:40** There you go.

**00:03:41** It's all the purse sounds.

**00:03:42** Right, now we're doing this for the show

**00:03:43** because now you're talking to the audience.

**00:03:44** I was just asking you about microphone technique.

**00:03:46** Right, but you see, we're into this conversation,

**00:03:48** which is now we've been talking about it for 17 minutes,

**00:03:51** it feels like surely it's gonna make its way into the show.

**00:03:54** And we're just talking about plosives,

**00:03:56** it's the purse sounds.

**00:03:58** But by the way, I have a windscreen on there.

**00:03:59** You hear how much better it is?

**00:04:00** Peter Piper picked up, right?

**00:04:02** It's not happening because I have a windscreen thing.

**00:04:05** Yeah, I have a windscreen thing too,

**00:04:07** and I've got the cover on the microphone,

**00:04:08** but it never works as advertised.

**00:04:11** I feel like the plosives are always really bad.

**00:04:14** Anyway, I put the microphone above me, pointing down,

**00:04:18** which is now-

**00:04:20** Why?

**00:04:21** To reduce the plosives, that's why, Mike.

**00:04:23** But why did you choose up pointing down?

**00:04:25** I'm just intrigued.

**00:04:28** Okay, so here was my reasoning for this is,

**00:04:31** sometimes you breathe through your nose,

**00:04:33** and so if the microphone is below you, surely,

**00:04:35** then you're just blowing right on top of the microphone,

**00:04:37** and that just would be annoying.

**00:04:39** But if the microphone's above you,

**00:04:41** you shouldn't have that problem.

**00:04:42** Have you ever noticed a time where your breath

**00:04:44** has made its way into a audio recording?

**00:04:47** I have.

**00:04:48** I mean, it's not a major problem,

**00:04:50** but I was just thinking if you pick one way or another,

**00:04:52** why not, they seem symmetrical.

**00:04:54** Right, I have a question for you.

**00:04:55** Will your new microphone technique do anything

**00:04:57** to reduce the amount of rustling that you do,

**00:05:00** or is that-

**00:05:01** Rustling?

**00:05:02** Yeah, I cut so much rustling.

**00:05:04** You never heard someone rustle as much as you do.

**00:05:06** No one else hears it, but there's all this clink clunk,

**00:05:09** there's little rappers of some kind doing over there,

**00:05:12** there's a glass picking up, putting down.

**00:05:14** You're very rustling.

**00:05:16** Rustling?

**00:05:16** Yeah.

**00:05:17** Oh, well, I guess I didn't put on my quiet shirt

**00:05:20** for the podcast recording today.

**00:05:21** Quiet shirt?

**00:05:23** Do you have a loud shirt?

**00:05:24** Yes, some shirts are louder than others, right?

**00:05:26** When you move, the shirt just makes more noise.

**00:05:29** I mean, I will say I've never heard a shirt.

**00:05:31** Okay, all right, well then it doesn't matter, no problem.

**00:05:33** I'm hearing you fiddling with things on the desk

**00:05:35** is what I get more of.

**00:05:37** Oh, okay, all right, well, I don't feel-

**00:05:39** The last episode was a thousand fishermen's friends,

**00:05:41** but that one was understood.

**00:05:44** I heard every fisherman's friend being unwrapped and consumed.

**00:05:49** I saved the cortexes from this, but I heard it.

**00:05:53** A lot crunching.

**00:05:56** I don't know what you're talking about.

**00:05:57** Okay, all right, well, you know what, whatever.

**00:05:59** I shouldn't have brought this up.

**00:06:00** This is a sensitive topic for you.

**00:06:03** No, no, no, no, it's not sensitive.

**00:06:05** What I'll say is, as far as Gray has a microphone question goes,

**00:06:09** this is one of the nicer ones for me.

**00:06:12** Because you're not doing anything wild.

**00:06:14** It's not like, hey, I unplugged my microphone, is that good?

**00:06:19** This is- That's unfair.

**00:06:20** This is fine what you're asking me.

**00:06:21** I go down pointing up just because I find that to be more comfortable

**00:06:25** because also I kind of would then point my face down

**00:06:28** towards the microphone to talk into the microphone

**00:06:31** rather than pointing it up to talk into the microphone.

**00:06:33** Oh, interesting points. That's an interesting point there.

**00:06:36** I find that to be more comfortable.

**00:06:39** I hadn't thought about that.

**00:06:40** The problem for me is I just never really think about the microphones

**00:06:43** until this moment when we start recording the show.

**00:06:47** Suddenly, I actually, my brain starts articulating the actual questions.

**00:06:52** Whereas before, I'm just like-

**00:06:53** Talking about this, I have a piece of follow up for you.

**00:06:57** Okay.

**00:06:57** That I heard in editing the show, it didn't clock for me the first time

**00:07:01** and I had some cortex and mention it.

**00:07:03** That there's a moment in the last episode where you talk about

**00:07:06** how nice it would be to have a fixed audio environment for the videos.

**00:07:10** Mm-hmm.

**00:07:11** Will you ever grace me with the same?

**00:07:15** You're like, oh, it'd be so great.

**00:07:17** It would be so great if the videos, all of the audio sounded the same.

**00:07:21** I have an unchangeable audio setup, right?

**00:07:25** Where like I have tape on the floor so it sounds the same.

**00:07:29** Will I ever get given that treat or no?

**00:07:32** So look, I know how this sounds, right?

**00:07:36** I know how this comes across.

**00:07:39** Okay.

**00:07:39** Let me explain my position here.

**00:07:42** Yeah.

**00:07:43** It is-

**00:07:43** Good luck.

**00:07:44** The problem with Cortex is that it's a podcast.

**00:07:48** Oh, that's a problem.

**00:07:49** So the issue here is that we're recording on a computer over a long period of time.

**00:07:58** Like it's a very different setup.

**00:08:00** When I'm envisioning like, oh, I would like to have a setup where I can have my video

**00:08:04** audio be the same every time.

**00:08:06** You don't have to record into a computer, right?

**00:08:08** Like you can use one of the road things to just do a direct recording on there.

**00:08:12** And then you can have a totally different setup.

**00:08:15** Why does it need to be a different setup?

**00:08:16** Why don't you just have one recording setup?

**00:08:18** No, because just by the fact that we're on the computer.

**00:08:24** Okay.

**00:08:24** So the software changes all of the time.

**00:08:26** Somewhere.

**00:08:27** We sit here for five hours in an afternoon and are talking to each other and recording

**00:08:33** the show.

**00:08:34** So during that time you move around.

**00:08:37** There's the Russell a bunch, right?

**00:08:39** Like you're moving back and forth from the microphone.

**00:08:41** Fisherman's friends.

**00:08:42** Right.

**00:08:42** Eat some Fisherman's friends.

**00:08:44** You crack your seat so it can, you can lay back and relax.

**00:08:48** Turn on and off the dehumidifier or whatever that beeping sound is.

**00:08:52** I was trying to do that so that you wouldn't notice because I had forgotten.

**00:08:55** Yes.

**00:08:55** You turn on and off the various things.

**00:08:58** I don't know if you did it then, but I didn't hear it then.

**00:08:59** I just hear it in general.

**00:09:01** Yeah.

**00:09:01** This is the funny thing of like all of these noises.

**00:09:04** I don't hear them because Skype compress, like Skype does like the audio compression.

**00:09:08** I only hear them later.

**00:09:11** I don't know all the shenanigans you're getting up to when we're talking.

**00:09:14** It's later on.

**00:09:16** Okay.

**00:09:16** Right.

**00:09:17** Yes.

**00:09:17** Skype compresses them away.

**00:09:18** So anyway, it's like, just look recording the podcast is just a more variable environment.

**00:09:25** Why are you doing that?

**00:09:29** But here's the thing, doesn't need to be.

**00:09:33** Like my environment, very static.

**00:09:37** I have a recording desk, microphone, everything stays the same.

**00:09:42** So it can happen.

**00:09:43** Yeah.

**00:09:45** Look, distance from the microphone is the number one factor.

**00:09:47** Like that's the big issue that just simply cannot stay the same when you're recording a podcast for forever.

**00:09:54** So look, here's my pitch to you.

**00:09:57** If I'm ever able to get an office where I work outside of the house, which seems increasingly unlikely with every passing day.

**00:10:02** No, no, we can do this.

**00:10:04** Right.

**00:10:05** And within that office, I'm able to set up just a little corner where I can keep the audio the same every time for when I record the videos.

**00:10:13** Just like don't touch anything.

**00:10:15** That means when I come back and I'm doing the podcasts from my home,

**00:10:21** it's more likely that I'm not going to mess with anything here because I don't need to change any of the settings or the way that I have everything set up for the video versus the podcast.

**00:10:33** Like you just can't keep those settings the same.

**00:10:35** It just doesn't work.

**00:10:36** And so I have to change them back and forth each time.

**00:10:39** And so if I had a dedicated place to record the audio for the video, I would have to change less about the cortex setup.

**00:10:46** This would be in your favor in the long run.

**00:10:49** I'm not stopping you.

**00:10:52** I encourage I feel like Mike, I feel like you make me sound like a crazy person whenever we have these like it seems very reasonable to me.

**00:11:00** But you're somehow framing me as though I'm the lunatic here.

**00:11:03** No, you're right.

**00:11:04** It is me.

**00:11:05** Yeah, I agree.

**00:11:06** Yeah, no, it's definitely me that does that.

**00:11:07** Why if you had an office, do you think you'd record the podcast at home?

**00:11:12** It's more comfy.

**00:11:13** Right.

**00:11:13** This podcast is an all day affair.

**00:11:15** Yes.

**00:11:15** So I feel like this is just a better environment for recording the podcast.

**00:11:19** I don't have opinions one way or another.

**00:11:20** I was just intrigued by that because when you had an office before, you were never there when we recorded.

**00:11:25** We know never I've always recorded the podcast from home.

**00:11:29** I mean, OK, that's not literally true, but it's basically true.

**00:11:31** I mean, you've recorded from hotel rooms all over the planet as of I.

**00:11:35** But like I couldn't remember because I remember when you're in the glass cube, obviously, we'd never do it because that was just like an audio hell.

**00:11:43** Yeah, man.

**00:11:44** I just had a flashback to that guy with the whiteboard.

**00:11:47** The guy with the whiteboard.

**00:11:49** There used to be a guy next to you who had a whiteboard and add a bunch of words on it.

**00:11:54** Oh, right.

**00:11:54** Can we talk about this on the show?

**00:11:55** I'm confident we did.

**00:11:57** Yes, I'm fairly sure that we had like a lot of buzzwords on a whiteboard.

**00:12:00** And you were doing the workout where his deal was.

**00:12:03** Yeah, I know.

**00:12:03** It's always fun in a cube farm to figure out what all the other cubies are up to.

**00:12:08** But you don't want them figuring out what you're up to.

**00:12:11** I can work them out.

**00:12:12** I don't want them to work me out.

**00:12:14** But yes, I know we're recording the podcast at home.

**00:12:16** It's just it's such a long affair.

**00:12:17** It feels like it makes much more sense and it's much more comfortable just to do from home.

**00:12:21** Okay.

**00:12:21** Again, part of the reason I really want the office outside of the home is as a like a dedicated

**00:12:27** production environment and that is lean towards video.

**00:12:31** So it's like it's just so much better if I go here, I work on the videos, I do everything about that.

**00:12:36** And then I leave and do other things elsewhere.

**00:12:39** I understand that.

**00:12:40** In the meantime, I'm going to experiment during this podcast with

**00:12:43** Nope.

**00:12:44** Flipping the microphone from pointing down to pointing up.

**00:12:48** And you let me know if you notice a difference.

**00:12:51** Talking about audio, I just wanted to mention this.

**00:12:54** No one got in touch with me.

**00:12:55** It was like a little secret last episode.

**00:12:59** We were talking about ADR, which is when in TV shows and movies, people add lines in after the fact.

**00:13:05** I ADR the line about ADR into the last episode.

**00:13:09** So when I was editing, I recorded a new line and edit it in.

**00:13:13** And I feel like I did a purposeful job of making it not sound like me then.

**00:13:19** The way that I did that was I wrote out what I said and then read it back using my bad acting skills.

**00:13:24** So I could hear it.

**00:13:25** Not one person wrote in to tell me that they spotted it.

**00:13:30** So I just want to put that out there.

**00:13:32** There was a treasure hunt in the last episode and nobody found the prize.

**00:13:36** Well, I think you're you're underrating your acting and ADR skills.

**00:13:40** Right.

**00:13:41** I think you did a good job of matching.

**00:13:42** See, I purposely didn't match it.

**00:13:44** I have done matching.

**00:13:46** Like I have done that and and consider it like successful.

**00:13:50** But I purposefully made it not sound right.

**00:13:54** I feel like.

**00:13:55** Yeah, I think you have some advantages that film sets really don't like film sets have a lot working

**00:14:01** against them for any ADR stuff.

**00:14:03** I should have recorded it in the bathroom, right?

**00:14:06** You know, put that in there.

**00:14:07** No, because if it's going if you're going to do podcasting ADR, it would have to be

**00:14:11** the reverse, right?

**00:14:12** Because what's happening in movies is they're using on set audio for their dialogue and then

**00:14:19** they have to record in a booth to do the ADR.

**00:14:22** So you should have had to be like performing a stunt while delivering that dialogue and then

**00:14:27** mixed it back in.

**00:14:28** Okay, like putting a car on two wheels.

**00:14:30** Yeah, I think people would have noticed it more if that was the case.

**00:14:33** If if you were, you know, performing stunts or just literally just outside, right?

**00:14:38** One of the other big like ways audio just sounds different as if you're outside.

**00:14:43** But yeah, nobody wrote in and noticed.

**00:14:44** I didn't even notice when I was editing the show.

**00:14:47** And I also had the advantage of knowing that you were going to do that.

**00:14:51** Also, the section of the audio in logic said Mike ADR.

**00:14:57** Right.

**00:14:58** So like you could have seen it.

**00:14:59** I mean, you probably weren't looking at the audio while you're listening to it.

**00:15:03** But you know, you could have been.

**00:15:04** Yes, I 100% was not looking at the audio.

**00:15:06** I was playing Game of Magic, which is what I always do.

**00:15:08** I wished I could do stuff like that, but I can't because I'm hands on.

**00:15:11** Right.

**00:15:11** Yeah.

**00:15:12** And you're doing the first pass, which is yeah, you have to be I have to be I'm cutting and

**00:15:15** cutting and cutting and cutting and cutting and cutting and cutting and cutting forever.

**00:15:19** And I know that like, really, your job is to listen.

**00:15:22** And I know you make tweaks and, you know, every now and then.

**00:15:24** But like, I would assume that you could go 10, 15 minutes about touching it.

**00:15:28** Yeah, ideally, that's what should be happening.

**00:15:30** Yeah.

**00:15:30** If I've done a good job.

**00:15:31** Yeah.

**00:15:31** So I'm not I'm not looking at it.

**00:15:32** And it was only when the show came to the end.

**00:15:34** I was like, Hey, wait a minute.

**00:15:35** Right.

**00:15:36** I know he puts some ADR.

**00:15:37** And so I just I found it by visually looking at the file.

**00:15:40** And I was like, there you are.

**00:15:42** Extra piece of audio.

**00:15:43** Because this is an audio show.

**00:15:45** I will cut that in now so you can hear it so people can see now that you know,

**00:15:49** it's there listeners.

**00:15:50** Can you hear it is the question.

**00:15:55** But like, I don't know what it is.

**00:15:56** I think that maybe it's just something like if you're used to dealing with audio and like

**00:16:02** piecing together the way people speak.

**00:16:04** It truly is incredible how hard it is to try and make something match.

**00:16:08** It takes a lot of work to try and get that right.

**00:16:11** And a lot of skill in controlling your own voice.

**00:16:18** Don't train people to listen for ADR.

**00:16:20** It's nothing but a curse.

**00:16:21** That's true.

**00:16:22** You know, it's like teaching people about typography.

**00:16:25** You're not doing anyone a favor by like, Oh, here's here's how to correctly kern letters.

**00:16:29** Like a fan of the.

**00:16:31** Yeah, like don't don't show people that it's not a font.

**00:16:35** It's a typeface.

**00:16:38** There's so many things like that in life where it's like, Oh, why did you teach me to appreciate

**00:16:43** this difference?

**00:16:45** Now I can just be annoyed at a thing I never cared about before.

**00:18:52** Congratulations on your return to YouTube.

**00:18:54** Oh, thanks. Yes.

**00:18:55** What took the extra time in the end, by the way, because when we spoke on the episode,

**00:19:00** you were like, I'm ready to go, baby, any day now.

**00:19:03** And it was like another week.

**00:19:05** It felt like that.

**00:19:06** I might have ADR'd a bunch of lines.

**00:19:12** I completely rerecorded the entire back third of that video, which is the whole physics section.

**00:19:19** And then there were a bunch of other lines that I did do much more ADR like of,

**00:19:24** okay, I'm going to try to cut this in and hopefully it doesn't sound too terrible.

**00:19:28** So yes, I was hoping not to do that, but as I came closer and closer to releasing it,

**00:19:33** I thought there were just enough of it that I wasn't happy with.

**00:19:37** You only work on these videos for a certain amount of time,

**00:19:40** but then you have to live with them for eternity in the way that they go up.

**00:19:44** And I thought I've spent months on this thing.

**00:19:48** I'm going to take the extra week and do this.

**00:19:52** It's always really hard to make the decisions about when to stop.

**00:19:57** Like it's not obvious when you passed a point of real diminishing returns.

**00:20:01** And so I think I had kind of talked myself into the idea that I was past the point of

**00:20:07** diminishing returns, but I was actually wrong.

**00:20:09** Like this was one case where it's like, no, no, it was the right decision to rerecord a bunch of it

**00:20:14** and also spend all of the effort to fix and tighten up and tweak some of the lines in the first two

**00:20:20** thirds. So I'm very glad I took that time because I'm much happier with the video that went up

**00:20:27** versus where it was at the time that we recorded.

**00:20:30** It would have been fine, but there's something really satisfying about

**00:20:34** tightening things up, tweaking it all together and then be like, aha,

**00:20:37** like now this thing is much better put together than it was previously.

**00:20:41** So that's why it ended up taking an additional week.

**00:20:44** It's like, oh, I'm going to free record this. Okay.

**00:20:48** Yeah, I think that that was the right call, right?

**00:20:50** Because I think something we were talking about was you didn't really want to peg this to be the,

**00:20:55** oh, that's when I had COVID video.

**00:20:58** So like, oh, you're a horse.

**00:21:00** You're a horse.

**00:21:01** You're a horse.

**00:21:02** You know, like you don't want that to come across in the in the video.

**00:21:05** And also like, I mean, you can tell me how I'm wrong, but it seems like it is doing very, very well.

**00:21:12** Yeah, it's doing really well.

**00:21:13** The thing that's interesting about it is it's so just for anyone listening,

**00:21:17** out of time, this is the runway video.

**00:21:19** That's the kind of like three in one video.

**00:21:21** The simple secret of runway digit is what it's currently called.

**00:21:25** So I didn't say the title.

**00:21:26** Who knows what it's going to be called years from now.

**00:21:29** YouTube baby.

**00:21:30** Yeah.

**00:21:31** The topic is runways and it's a three in one video and it has a,

**00:21:35** it has a unique eight letter identifier in the YouTube URL and that has how it's referred to.

**00:21:41** But yeah, it is doing very well.

**00:21:43** I would say the thing that's interesting is it's following the same pattern that the Tiffany two

**00:21:49** video did the sort of follow up to the tale of Tiffany, which is that it is doing very well.

**00:21:56** Asterisk the, the audience is extremely lopsided to pre-existing viewers and subscribers,

**00:22:05** which is not bad.

**00:22:06** Like I'm not complaining about that, but I would prefer to see that there were more

**00:22:11** new people being brought in.

**00:22:13** So it's doing well, but I can see on the back end, it's like, okay, this is almost entirely

**00:22:19** YouTube recommending this to my existing viewers, which I think given the fact that it is a 17

**00:22:27** minute video about runways is not wildly surprising that that might be a hard sell to someone who

**00:22:34** doesn't already know the channel.

**00:22:35** Like, yep, this guy made a 17 minute video about runways.

**00:22:40** Are you interested in watching?

**00:22:41** I think most viewers would go, not really.

**00:22:44** No, it's different to plain boarding video.

**00:22:48** Yeah, exactly.

**00:22:49** But so here's my, I guess what I'd say is how did, how is this one fairing in this regard to

**00:22:54** the interstate highway numbering video?

**00:22:58** Because these feel akin to me.

**00:22:59** What do you mean just in terms of like, how many views is it doing?

**00:23:01** Well, like in that, that breakup that you would like the makeup you're talking about of like

**00:23:05** existing subscribers and like, how is it performing against that video?

**00:23:09** Yeah, yeah.

**00:23:10** So basically like, as far as I can tell, pretty much day one, YouTube is almost exclusively

**00:23:15** showing it to your own viewers.

**00:23:17** And I think YouTube is just using that as a test to see, oh, like how well is this video doing

**00:23:22** with people who already like this content?

**00:23:24** And then only from day two, do you start to see, okay, is YouTube pushing this to new people or not?

**00:23:30** And I think with, with videos, what I want to see and what the interstate video had

**00:23:36** is that the ratio of existing viewers to new viewers is approaching, but never quite reaching

**00:23:43** 50 50.

**00:23:45** So it's maybe like 60% of the views are your subscribers and 40% are new viewers, but videos

**00:23:52** like Tiffany two and this one, the ratio is a lot closer to something like 90 10, right?

**00:23:58** Where 90% of the views are coming from existing viewers and 10% is new viewers.

**00:24:04** So that's, I didn't check this morning, what the video was doing, but last time I looked,

**00:24:08** it was a lot closer to the 90 10 end of the spectrum than the 50 50 end of the spectrum.

**00:24:13** Which the interstate video had more was closer to the 50.

**00:24:16** Yeah, I feel like interstate video, again, I'd have to double check, but I feel like that was

**00:24:20** doing 60 40 a few days afterward, which also I feel like it's not surprising topic wise.

**00:24:26** It's in the same way that like when that Tiffany followup video came out, I was very like, Oh,

**00:24:31** you know, I don't think this is going to do very well because it's a followup.

**00:24:35** And then like, there's a funny thing if people are just looking at the view numbers,

**00:24:39** which is that the followup video has more views than the original.

**00:24:42** It's crushed it, not just more. It's like, it's, you know, one at some point will be double,

**00:24:47** right? Like it's a big surprise.

**00:24:49** Yeah, at some point it's going to be double. But on the back end, there is a funny way in which

**00:24:56** the first video is much more successful at bringing in people who didn't know about the

**00:25:01** channel. But that makes sense to me though. That's that followup video is referential like,

**00:25:07** and it's very personal. I think in a way that it doesn't necessarily make sense. It's like,

**00:25:15** this is how it's a behind the scenes. Like this is how I made that video. Yeah.

**00:25:18** But then you get into the more, then more people have seen the video with the behind the scenes

**00:25:23** in the actual video. Like I still don't understand how it's possible. Like, I don't know how someone

**00:25:28** could come to that video and then not watch the, like be like, Oh, I should watch the original

**00:25:33** first. Like I should watch the video. This is referencing. Like it's such a funny thing to me,

**00:25:38** but it is what it is.

**00:25:40** I think it makes a lot more sense when you realize that the vast majority of people are

**00:25:44** just watching whatever YouTube happens to recommend to them. And so like, if you really internalize,

**00:25:49** what does that mean? That then I think this scenario makes way more sense because if you

**00:25:55** think about it, the Tiffany video might be less interesting to the average subscriber,

**00:26:01** but the followup video might be way more interesting to the average subscriber.

**00:26:05** Okay.

**00:26:06** And so then if you think about if YouTube is just recommending stuff to people and most people are

**00:26:11** just following YouTube's recommendations, that pattern actually makes sense. If the Tiffany

**00:26:17** video is less interesting to people who are already subscribed. So it is not likely to be

**00:26:23** recommended compared to something else after someone has finished watching Tiffany too.

**00:26:28** So, so that's why like, I find that that pattern less surprising than it initially seems.

**00:26:33** And the breakdown of like new subscribers versus existing ones lines up with exactly what I would

**00:26:39** expect with that one. So as of right now, I would just say that the runway video is

**00:26:46** doing great. I am both extremely happy and extremely relieved that it is doing as well

**00:26:54** as it is doing. I just think I didn't necessarily think that it might break in this way of like

**00:27:02** four existing viewers only in the same way that Tiffany too did. So that's just something

**00:27:07** interesting I didn't think about at the time, but in retrospect makes a lot of sense.

**00:27:11** Do you think that there exists like a pent up demand kind of feeling?

**00:27:14** Do you existing viewership? They're like, Oh my God, there's a new gray video.

**00:27:18** Yes, for sure. There's definitely got to be a pent up demand effect. The thing that is good

**00:27:23** though, is that I can see that the retention is still pretty high on video like this. Yeah. So

**00:27:28** that's, that's the main thing is like, Ooh, is the retention worse on something like this compared

**00:27:34** to other things? That would be an indicator. It's like, Ooh, pent up demand, but also not being

**00:27:40** satisfied pent up demand. It would be if the watch time was not as good, but this is the whole

**00:27:45** reason why I think YouTube is actually recommending it to a bunch of my subscribers is because there

**00:27:50** is a pent up demand. People are clicking on it probably because of that. And then they are

**00:27:55** staying a long time and they're interested. And so YouTube is then amplifying that effect of like,

**00:28:01** okay, this actually is something that his existing subscribers want to watch and they want to watch

**00:28:07** it to the end. So that that's where it's kind of hitting all those points. I've become much more

**00:28:13** or I've paid more attention to a lot of this stuff in the past year, looking at how videos are doing

**00:28:19** in a bunch of different ways. And part of that is kind of related to my theme of like new decades

**00:28:26** dawn of if I want to be doing this for a long period of time, I have to like think about it

**00:28:30** in a different way than I have previously. And so yeah, I feel like I've just been digging into

**00:28:35** the details more with statistics on videos and seeing what's happening. How does this compare to

**00:28:41** other stuff? What's different? What's working? What's not? You can, you know, one can never know

**00:28:46** the actual mind of the algorithm, but you can try to see some patterns and try to bin different

**00:28:53** videos in different places in your mind. And this then gets put into the category of like,

**00:29:00** oh, this is a video that's really solid for existing viewers. There's a funny counter

**00:29:06** example, which we talked about maybe it was half a year ago when it came out where I did that Tesla

**00:29:11** video about the most deadly road in America. That one is the flip case where that video was my

**00:29:18** worst video on release by a lot. Like it was just tanking. And the reason there was is like, oh,

**00:29:24** YouTube showing it to existing viewers. It's different for a bunch of reasons that I totally

**00:29:29** can see in retrospect and like existing subscribers did not love that video. So YouTube was really

**00:29:34** hesitant to recommend it to anyone, but it's been slowly creeping up over time. And it's like, oh,

**00:29:41** I can see that YouTube is actually slowly finding the new viewers who are interested in that. So

**00:29:49** like that one has flip statistics. It's like almost all of the views come from people who have

**00:29:53** never seen the channel before. And it's been ever so slowly picking up steam, but it's just,

**00:29:59** it's interesting to see as a counter example of like, oh, okay, that's the opposite effect. And

**00:30:04** it's also a little bit heartening just to know that if you try something that's different,

**00:30:08** but some people like it, YouTube may be able to eventually find the people who are interested in

**00:30:14** that thing. So, uh, you know, for like a, basically like a vlog style video, I'm pretty happy with

**00:30:20** where that is now, even though it was real depressing the first week that that one came

**00:30:25** out. That was awful. Cause that was also a gap, right? There was a big gap, not like as big,

**00:30:31** but there was quite a gap between that and the prior video. Again, there's many things about

**00:30:36** this job that are weird that people might not think about, but the having gaps in your upload

**00:30:45** schedule is a, is a kind of pressure that I think a lot of people would deal very poorly with. And

**00:30:54** you know, I've been on both sides of that, like with the Tesla video, that was real bad when it

**00:30:59** wasn't doing well. And there had been a gap and this is the flip side where it's like, okay,

**00:31:04** there's been a, the longest gap ever. I am really happy that it is being very well received among

**00:31:11** my subscribers. There's just such a deep unpleasantness in that feeling as an upload

**00:31:17** gap grows longer and longer. You know that there's this implicit audience expectation

**00:31:24** that you're going to come back with something bigger and bigger. That's not always the case,

**00:31:29** guys. It doesn't work like that. It's like next one's going to be a banger. Yes, exactly. I always

**00:31:34** feel like obviously I feel for you in these moments, but I really feel for the YouTubers who

**00:31:40** they have huge gaps and their videos are like three hours long. Oh, I know. Yeah. Right. And

**00:31:45** that just, that feels so horrible to me to imagine like how something like that to put something

**00:31:53** together must be so immense. I mean, I assume I was like, I'm not just saying cause you're here,

**00:32:00** I assume that you have a somewhat similar cause it's the animation, right? Animation takes a really

**00:32:04** long time. Um, so there is definitely someone out there for you too. But like you see the people

**00:32:09** come and they're like, they got these really nicely well-produced, well-written, well-researched

**00:32:14** videos that are like three hours long and they release a few of them a year. I mean,

**00:32:19** if you just chose the wrong topic, man, that feels. I just want to clarify here. The holdup is always

**00:32:27** on the writing end. Yes, we spend a ton of time on the animation, but if, but if you're looking at

**00:32:32** like what causes the delay, it's like a 95% of it is me writing. Like that's what causes the delay

**00:32:39** on this end. But yeah, what you mentioned there is I found it like, it's an interesting phenomenon

**00:32:44** that over the years there's in a way that I think could never have existed before. There are an

**00:32:51** increasingly large number of channels that do that thing that you've just mentioned. Okay. I'm

**00:32:56** pleased you said this because I feel like I'm seeing more of it, but I just thought that that

**00:33:00** might just be like a, no, it's, it is not you I'm seeing. No way. Like it's, it's not a, it's not

**00:33:05** just you. It's totally a thing that exists. The reason I've really tuned into it is I think that

**00:33:11** I used to be a real statistical outlier in terms of the rarity of upload, but now there are a lot

**00:33:19** of channels that upload way less frequently than I do. Yeah. And like it, it makes me stressed out,

**00:33:27** even just to think about that. It's, it's the pressure of that is unbelievable. Like you said,

**00:33:34** if you pick wrong two out of three times, which is very easy to do, like it's un unbearable,

**00:33:42** the amount of pressure that's there. I don't know the exact reason for this phenomenon, but I

**00:33:46** think of this a lot like there are channels that are realizing you can basically be a small team

**00:33:58** who makes an episode of TV or a movie all on your own in the course of many months. Like that's

**00:34:06** basically what they're doing. I actually have a theory for why I think this is changing membership

**00:34:11** Patreon, that kind of support that Eric support, because, you know, these are creators that would

**00:34:17** like to make long documentary style pieces, but the YouTube payment system doesn't really want

**00:34:24** you to do that. Right? Like the way that money works on YouTube benefits someone who produces

**00:34:30** lots of small videos on a frequent scale, because then the more inventory you have for people to

**00:34:36** watch the more money you can make, the more likely you are to be able to turn this into a living.

**00:34:40** Right? Because just all of the numbers just keep going up over time. And the more videos you make,

**00:34:45** the more incremental views you get on all of them. Right? And it can and then YouTube, that sense can

**00:34:50** start to make sense for you. But if you do if you have like a Patreon model, which like the one that

**00:34:58** you switch to of like, there will be a monthly support, whether or not there's a video and like

**00:35:05** you're asking people to come along on that journey with you, right? And there's like a bunch of

**00:35:09** YouTube is that I support that way. It allows you to take the time where if you to work on larger

**00:35:18** projects, because you couldn't do that every month. Like no one could make like two hour videos every

**00:35:24** month to either a support the pay me when uploads go or be the YouTube system of just like keep

**00:35:31** feeding this content. So I think as I feel like I'm seeing more and more creators now doing the

**00:35:36** monthly support thing and saying kind of like, if you really like what I'm doing here, you know,

**00:35:43** there's going to be more like will you support this? And then it allows them to go ahead and

**00:35:49** make these videos. And it doesn't matter what YouTube think of them. Yeah, I think I think you

**00:35:53** have a point there about just the financial structure that needs to exist in order for that

**00:35:59** to happen. I do think embedded sponsorships are a big part of that, because I can also think of very

**00:36:05** few channels can really only think of one that has this model and also still doesn't have embedded

**00:36:12** sponsorships. But even that though, if you're only doing one video a year, or like three videos a

**00:36:18** year, four videos a year, and you're selling the sponsorships upfront, admittedly, I don't know how

**00:36:23** this works on YouTube, like it doesn't matter how big the video like you could tell me the answer

**00:36:28** to this question maybe for embedded ads on YouTube, by and large is the practice that you set the price

**00:36:34** beforehand. Yeah, and it's a fixed price. Yeah, that's how that's usually how it works. Right. So

**00:36:38** then it's like, if the video blows up, it doesn't make a difference to you, because you have to have

**00:36:43** given a number that you're confident you're going to hit. So like, yes, it helps. But if you're, if

**00:36:48** you're doing this, like three videos a year, and they're mammoth in length, I still think that the

**00:36:53** monthly support is going to make the actual difference. This is to me, what is the unbelievable

**00:36:59** pressure of those kinds of things is because subscribers are not really your own on YouTube,

**00:37:05** and it's entirely about what YouTube recommends, you can just whiff on a video in a major way at

**00:37:13** any moment, right? And like, that is the horrifying thing about doing this and having a big gap,

**00:37:21** where you then upload a really long video. I just think like, there is just a fundamental

**00:37:28** rule that are not a fundamental rule, but I think it's a very good guideline that advertisers in

**00:37:37** general outbid direct support through things like Patreon, like they just pay more. So that's why I

**00:37:44** think it really is a critical factor that these channels that do really long things really far

**00:37:49** apart, they have to have the embedded sponsorship almost like near universally. I'm gonna challenge

**00:37:55** one point on that. And you can, I mean, again, you know more than me about this specific world,

**00:38:00** right? If you have a creator who has a Patreon, and that Patreon gives them money every month,

**00:38:06** whether or not there's a video and they release four videos in a calendar year,

**00:38:10** would the sponsorship outweigh the full total of the Patreon if their Patreon is really successful?

**00:38:16** Mike, I'm gonna say yes. Like, yeah.

**00:38:20** Here's the thing, right? If the video is going to hit a million, and if they're confident they're

**00:38:25** gonna hit a million, then yes, of course. But you have to be very confident in that, right?

**00:38:30** Yeah. And that's what the pressure is.

**00:38:31** Because if you don't, you're not going to get the money.

**00:38:34** Yeah, that's going to cause a lot of problems.

**00:38:37** This is kind of, so my assumption would be, if you're a YouTuber, and you're a smart one,

**00:38:43** you're leaving a lot of money on the table when it comes to sponsorship. Because if your video

**00:38:48** blows up, you don't get more money for it, right? So you have to like, bet it at a level which

**00:38:54** you're confident you're going to hit. And for most YouTubers, that I'm confident I'm going to

**00:38:58** hit number, will a lot of the time for popular ones be significantly less? Do you have a I'm

**00:39:05** confident I'm going to hit number? No, like I don't.

**00:39:08** Because you don't need to think about it anymore.

**00:39:10** But what we're talking about right here, like this is a big part of the reason why I stopped doing

**00:39:15** the embedded sponsorships, is because I just found it so incredibly stressful.

**00:39:20** Right.

**00:39:20** It's like, I hated it. It made me so miserable. It really did.

**00:39:25** And this is why I'm assuming that for a lot of people, I would expect that the Patreon

**00:39:31** is making a huge difference in that. Because you actually can feel like you've got some some kind

**00:39:37** of level of bankable income to support you through that process. And like, yeah, you can make a lot of

**00:39:43** money on the ad side. But that comes with a lot of increased pressure. If you want to try and

**00:39:51** make the money you quote unquote, should make membership and Patreon that supplies reliability.

**00:40:00** Yeah.

**00:40:01** Right. Embedded sponsorships provide more income, but at like a cost of greater variability,

**00:40:10** and wildly increased stress. Like I think that that's basically what the situation is there.

**00:40:15** And like people might say, like, Mike, isn't this just what you do? Right. And the answer is yes,

**00:40:19** but no. Yeah. Yes, but no, not at all. Yeah. Because yes, we sell sponsorships. And at the

**00:40:27** moment, our sponsorships are more lucrative than our membership. However, I don't know how that's

**00:40:33** going to change in the future, because membership continues to creep up, say for this show, in a way

**00:40:39** that our ad rates don't. And part of that is because like we set an ad rate, an amount of

**00:40:45** money that we go down to sponsors. And like, say this is how much it's going to cost. And this is

**00:40:50** how many people listen. And that how many people listen number is set a significantly lower number

**00:40:56** than we actually tend to hit because there is variability, right? But it's not a massive

**00:41:01** difference. But there is variability. But the one of the differences between podcasts and YouTube is

**00:41:06** like, if you subscribe, you probably listen. And the numbers show. But all we get is like,

**00:41:12** we don't know how many subscribers we have, right? We know how many people by some kind of level of

**00:41:18** approximation have pressed play. Yes. And that's all you get. And that's very different to YouTube,

**00:41:24** right? Where like, you get that in the how many people have viewed, but you also have a subscriber

**00:41:29** number. And so like, you've got these two numbers, you can't really work out what to sell on, maybe,

**00:41:34** I don't know, but we don't have that part. But the variability is way lower. Like,

**00:41:39** podcast episodes don't blow up. They don't go viral by and large. Yeah. And the variance is just lower,

**00:41:48** which makes the job of selling a sponsorship so much easier. But it's much more comforting. And

**00:41:53** also, if an episode does like, have a big difference, the amount of big difference it has

**00:42:00** is not so large that you feel like, Oh, man, I left so much money on the table here.

**00:42:05** Right. I think I would summarize it this way. If you took an average podcast episode, and then

**00:42:10** you say, Oh, what's the best episode we did in the year? And what's the worst episode we did in a

**00:42:14** year? The best episode might be 20% more than the average episode. And the worst episode might be

**00:42:20** 20% less than the average episode. On YouTube, that number is 20 times, right? So like, you take the

**00:42:26** average one and like the best one can be 20 times as much. And the worst one can be a 20th of the

**00:42:34** average number. Like, there is a funny thing where like me and you we had like, we actually did have

**00:42:39** a funny thing like this today, where we were looking through some stats of the show and realized

**00:42:44** there was an episode that significantly outpaced other episodes. And we were surprised by it. But

**00:42:49** the difference, as you say, it was a little bit larger than normal, it was about 30%. But like,

**00:42:54** it wasn't like, Oh, my God, we've made a terrible mistake kind of thing. Right. So it is true, right?

**00:42:59** But like, if we were looking at that, like, Oh, my God, this is a huge difference level on YouTube,

**00:43:06** it would be just by the nature of the platform for us to say like, this is a huge difference,

**00:43:10** most likely it's going to be a very big number. As an actual viewer, I really like that there's

**00:43:17** this kind of outlier content of someone's going to go away, and then they're going to come back with

**00:43:21** a three hour long video about a thing or they're going to come back with just like a crazy in depth

**00:43:27** video about a particular topic. I really like that that stuff exists. But the content creator in me

**00:43:35** can never not look at that and just be absolutely horrified. I mean, I respect the game, right?

**00:43:42** Yeah, because I know I couldn't play it. Also, from my perspective, it's kind of more

**00:43:46** relieving to see people playing in some ways like a higher stakes. Yeah, right. Yeah, yeah.

**00:43:53** Like, I'm gonna pop him in my 18 minute animation and I'm rolling the dice on it. Like, you good

**00:43:57** luck on your like four hour video. Exactly. It's it's interesting to see that kind of thing happen.

**00:44:02** And also just because I think people always get weird ideas in their head about how YouTube works.

**00:44:08** And like the meme of watch time is really in some people's minds. It's like, guys, I guarantee you,

**00:44:14** even these channels, they're doing really long things. They're not like on the YouTube side,

**00:44:19** coming out like bandits, because what YouTube still wants is lots of videos frequently. I even saw

**00:44:26** this on my own recent video where people were leaving comments. They're like, Oh, yeah, it's

**00:44:31** grays playing the watch time game. It totally makes sense to upload like a really long video

**00:44:35** every once in a while. It's like, no, it doesn't trust me. It does. Yeah, it's like, I guess on

**00:44:41** that. Right. Like, and this is a terrible example. But like, how much better are animated videos and

**00:44:46** the Cortex channel do it in the podcast videos? Oh, yeah. Right. Hugely better. Because people

**00:44:52** want short videos. Yes. And I know that there's like a million reasons, right? That like, of course,

**00:44:57** the animations are more engaging than just like the static screen of the audio of the show playing

**00:45:01** like a year there. But like, YouTube also serves them and like, yeah, short videos. That's what

**00:45:08** the system wants now. Right. But as you say, there was a time where watch time was the thing,

**00:45:16** but it's kind of grabbed its hold on people and they haven't let go of it. Like people think it's

**00:45:21** that's what the algorithm wants. Yeah, it exists in people's minds. Again, watch time is very

**00:45:26** important, but I think this meme got in people's heads when YouTube first rolled this out and

**00:45:32** clearly had overtuned the system to recommend stuff purely based on watch time. And like,

**00:45:38** they've pulled that back. And I think people can complain about the algorithm a lot. I certainly

**00:45:44** do. I still think watch time is actually quite a good metric. All things considered. It's just

**00:45:48** funny how people have it in their head whenever you release a long video, it's like, Oh, he's doing

**00:45:52** that to play the algorithm game. It's like, I guarantee to you, whoever you're watching,

**00:45:57** who just released a 90 minute video, they're not playing the algorithm. No, they are rolling the

**00:46:04** dice. Yeah. The only game they're playing with the algorithm is Russian roulette. Like that is the

**00:46:11** game they're playing because the longer your video, right? The higher the risk you're playing for

**00:46:16** retention, which is another very important statistic because if people stick through for

**00:46:22** the entire video, well, that shows that the videos engage in the entire time. Like that's

**00:46:27** going to be an indication to the algorithm of like, Hey, yeah, this is a good one. If you've got a

**00:46:32** video that's like three hours long, you're way increasing the ability for people to bail on it.

**00:46:38** Every second the viewer is watching is an opportunity for them to bail because they've

**00:46:43** lost interest. Every single second. It's very interesting because Mr. Beast has a lot of stuff

**00:46:50** where he's talked publicly about this, you know, the, at the time of recording, I mean, you can

**00:46:54** basically say he's the most popular YouTuber. He doesn't have the most subscribers, but he gets,

**00:46:58** he's got to be pulling in the most views. I think it doesn't matter the numbers. I don't think matter.

**00:47:03** I think that's obvious, right? In subscribers, subscribers is a nothing number because we spoke

**00:47:08** about this, right? Like it doesn't matter how many subscribers you have, just the views you have,

**00:47:12** but Mr. Beast is like the YouTuber, right? Yeah. Like this person changes every now and again.

**00:47:18** Right now is Mr. Beast. Yeah. But I think one of the things that's key about his success,

**00:47:24** if you watch his videos, like, and I will admit it took me a little while to kind of get what he was

**00:47:28** doing. Like I've watched some of his videos and I thought like, I'm totally not interested in this,

**00:47:33** but I kind of forced myself to keep watching them. I thought, oh, okay. At some point it clicked. I'm

**00:47:37** like, ah, I get it. But he is the king of maximizing watch time while giving the viewer the,

**00:47:45** the fewest possible reasons to click away. And his stuff tends to be in the like 10 to 20 minute

**00:47:55** range. A lot of, a lot of his videos. And I feel like intentionally or unintentionally,

**00:48:01** he's really min maxed. What is possible here? And I feel like that gets unintentionally everything

**00:48:08** I've heard and seen about him. I don't think anything he does in it is unintentional.

**00:48:12** Yeah. So I meant on it. I meant unintentionally in the way of like, he's the right person at the

**00:48:19** right time. Not like that, that he is being undeliberate in the, in the video.

**00:48:23** Because it seems like he is really turned maximizing for the algorithm into an art form.

**00:48:28** Yes. Yeah. But like, so what I mean by unintentional, it's just like, there existed an ecological niche

**00:48:34** that was waiting to be filled. We just didn't know that. Right. And he came along and he's,

**00:48:39** he's completely filled it. But if you watch his stuff, if you listen to him talk about the editing,

**00:48:43** yeah, he's, he's just being really good at like, give them a reason to get to the end.

**00:48:49** Don't give them any reason to click away. And he accomplishes that very well in his videos. But

**00:48:55** again, like I think the fact that they rarely go over 20 minutes, I mean, I feel like he's got some

**00:49:00** in the 30 minute range, but again, we're getting to like very few. That is also why I really respect

**00:49:06** the channels that try to do something for like an hour or two hours on a topic. Because again,

**00:49:12** you're fighting against the natural thing. Like the guy who's the best at this takes a topic and

**00:49:19** spends 20 minutes on it. And you're playing the super high wire game of I'm going to spend two

**00:49:26** hours on this thing. And that's, that's a lot of seconds for someone to potentially click away on

**00:49:32** to something else. And then YouTube looks at that and says, Oh, people only watched a third of the

**00:49:37** way into the video. So like, why would you recommend this to people if they don't get to the end? Like,

**00:49:42** uh, now your video is going to have a bad time and you've only done four in a year.

**00:51:51** of this show and Relay FM. One of the things that I latched on to this video, and I think many other

**00:51:56** people did because I think it's the real beauty of this video is the three in one kind of idea

**00:52:03** where you've got three kind of distinct videos going on inside of this video to the point where

**00:52:10** you, I think quite masterfully, I will say, my hat is off to you. The secret gray video inside with

**00:52:18** like the set being built when that set started building itself, I was like, God damn it. That's

**00:52:23** smart. So Bravo to you there. But what was going on with this? Like why this? Why this three in

**00:52:30** one? This why not three videos? Like why did you do it this way? So after a video has been out for

**00:52:35** a while, even though I've been looking at statistics more now, one of the things that YouTube's had

**00:52:39** around for a really long time that I have always looked at is the graph of audience retention.

**00:52:46** They have a much more useful version of it, which is called like relative audience attention,

**00:52:51** which is basically a line. And it says, compared to every other video on YouTube, which is this

**00:52:58** same length, how many people are still watching at a particular moment, which I think is way more

**00:53:04** useful than the curve that everyone seems to want to talk about, which is just a percent of viewers

**00:53:08** still watching at moments. I didn't even know that that existed that graph. That sounds better. Yeah.

**00:53:12** It's like a much better indicator of like, I want to know where people are interested and where are

**00:53:20** they not. And that graph in my experience really matches up with, I don't know, is scenes the right

**00:53:27** word, but like in a video you have little sections where you're talking, like we're talking about

**00:53:30** this and now we're talking about this. And I feel like the relative audience retention graph

**00:53:35** matches up really well with where the scenes are. Like you can kind of see when a scene starts and

**00:53:40** when a scene ends. And so I think one thing I've gotten better at over the years in making videos

**00:53:46** by looking at that little graph is in some of my older videos, I would have a really big drop off

**00:53:53** when people would stop watching. And it was only after the video had gone up, I could look at it

**00:54:00** and say, Oh, I didn't realize, but at this moment I was changing topics. Like we started talking

**00:54:08** about a thing and then I lose a bunch of people here because suddenly we're talking about something

**00:54:15** that's related or it's not quite the main thing. We're going to get back to the main thing, but

**00:54:20** we're on a little bit of a diversion over here. My expectation is that's just when it gets too

**00:54:27** complicated for people and they leave. Yeah, sometimes that can be the case. I think there

**00:54:32** are other ones, I can't think of a video off the top of my head, but it's where it's just like,

**00:54:36** Oh, now we're talking about something that's related, but not the same, which is just different

**00:54:40** from complicated. It's just like, Oh, this video is now moving in a different direction. I feel like

**00:54:45** I'm just talking for myself here. You know what I mean? And I'm like, Oh, I don't understand anymore.

**00:54:51** I don't think that's the case, Mike. But as a viewer as well, when you're watching something,

**00:54:55** you can sometimes feel those moments of like, Oh wait, what are we doing now? Like, why are we

**00:54:58** talking about this? So I think over many years, I've gotten better at doing that less of narrowing

**00:55:06** the focus and keeping the video like on point, right? What is this about? This is about which

**00:55:12** planet is the most is closest and like, boom, we're going to, we're going to stick on this.

**00:55:17** And like, I think my graphs have gotten smoother about not losing people during particular sections.

**00:55:23** But so with this video, it kind of started when I was talking to my parents back when I was

**00:55:28** visiting them. And we were talking about runways and airplanes. My mom's a former flight attendant,

**00:55:34** so this stuff comes up all the time. Somehow it came up about like, Oh, the runway numbers,

**00:55:39** like how do they come up? And so we started looking into it. What are you laughing at there, Mike?

**00:55:44** Your time of your family is very different to my time with my family.

**00:55:48** I get the impression that whenever I tell people stuff like this,

**00:55:51** I don't think this is what normal families do. I don't think people are sitting around and they're

**00:55:56** like, let's look into what to why there are numbers on runways. Is that not how that goes?

**00:56:04** I don't think that that is in the wall. Do you not have the thing where someone is going to be

**00:56:08** googling and then they airplay to the TV in front of everyone so everyone can watch the googling as

**00:56:13** we as we're trying to create a PowerPoint presentation. That's how it works in my family.

**00:56:18** Hey, look, I'm not surprised, but I don't think I'm not sure. I mean, I would like to know if

**00:56:23** people's family lives are like this, but I know mine isn't. So anyway, as families do,

**00:56:29** they're collectively googling to try to find the answer to a thing. And so we like we found

**00:56:33** obviously a bunch of it's like, it's not like actually some kind of crazy secret, right? It's

**00:56:37** a well-known piece of information. But what I found really interesting and one of the reasons why

**00:56:41** the topic stuck with me is that they all stopped after explaining like, Oh, this is the magnetic

**00:56:47** heading. But surely the most interesting thing about this is that the magnetic pull moves.

**00:56:54** They all stopped in their explanations before they got to that point.

**00:56:58** And so when I was working on the video, I kept thinking about, okay, I want to do this,

**00:57:06** but if I'm going to do it, this is a time where they're 100% has to be a topic change in the

**00:57:14** middle of the video. Originally, I didn't want to have anything to do with physics. There was only

**00:57:19** supposed to be one topic change. But you know, so this, this, but this was like the dawn of this

**00:57:24** video is there has to be a topic change. And so I thought, okay, the moment I realized like this can

**00:57:30** really work as a video is if you do the reverse, instead of trying to get rid of topic changes,

**00:57:36** acknowledge the fact that there is a topic change and just really lean into it. And that's when it

**00:57:42** was like, here's the idea of the video within a video. And so over the scripts, we kind of built

**00:57:48** on that and like made it bigger and bigger each time. But that was actually the whole reason for

**00:57:53** it was, was kind of like an audience retention thing of it's much more interesting if I very

**00:57:59** explicitly acknowledge we're like starting over with another topic. This is part of the reason why

**00:58:08** before publication, I was extremely concerned that this video could just totally bomb. Because

**00:58:13** I thought like, if it doesn't work, I've introduced two moments that basically guarantee the audience

**00:58:20** can leave now where they go like, I don't care at all about this, if you work backwards from what

**00:58:25** you're doing back to your insight, like, like you can take you can draw a different path, right?

**00:58:31** You're like, I know that topic changes, like, accidental topic changes can result in people

**00:58:36** leaving. At this point, you have nothing to tell you that purposeful topic changes will produce a

**00:58:42** different result. Yeah. In fact, if anything, it may make it worse. Oh, yeah, yeah, it may make it

**00:58:49** way worse. Yeah. Now, again, obviously, I made the video because I thought, I think we can do this in

**00:58:55** a way where it does work. I think it can, it can be better this way. But I could have been wrong.

**00:59:02** You go back to the insight and like, yes, you've drawn a conclusion, but there's nothing to

**00:59:06** say that that was the right move. And also, like, there's nothing to say that this would work again.

**00:59:11** Yeah, yeah. Right. Like, yeah. Yeah. I mean, look, there's a reason why in 10 years I've done this

**00:59:18** once, because it happens to work well in this way. It's also why like the script is funny to me,

**00:59:24** where like, Greg keeps saying like, Oh, this isn't a physics video is because that was also my personal

**00:59:30** experience. It's like, God damn it, I really don't want to talk about the like, I think this magic

**00:59:34** trick can work once of there's a video in the video. But I ended up making it like, Oh God,

**00:59:40** we do it twice. And I was really concerned because I think like that last third part of the reason I

**00:59:46** rerecord it, like it's better now. But it's still, it's still like the slowest part of the video.

**00:59:52** And even just like it everyday life, when people find out that you've done physics, they're often

**00:59:58** kind of repelled, right? And they let you know, right? Like, people will just straight up tell you

**01:00:04** like, Oh, I hated physics, right? Like, you know, I still will always remember one of my doctors while

**01:00:11** he was giving me an injection and it came about me having physics, he's like, I did really bad in my

**01:00:15** physics classes. And it's like, dude, that is not what I want to hear right now. You don't tell me you

**01:00:20** did anything other than perfect in every science. Yeah. Especially when you have a needle in my arm.

**01:00:26** While you're performing like some kind of injection, right? Yeah, you're performing some kind of medical

**01:00:31** thing on me. I just want you to tell me you were aced everything. It's like, you know, you don't

**01:00:36** want your anesthesiologist to be telling you he didn't do great on his kinematics test. And it's

**01:00:40** like, Nope, dude, that's not what I want to hear. So people are like real vocal about I did bad in

**01:00:46** physics and I hate it, right? Which is one of these things that you just find out if you have a degree

**01:00:51** in physics that ever comes up. So that's why I was really worried about the last third of it.

**01:00:55** The payoff was good though. You set it up well, right? Like I was excited when the physics part

**01:01:01** started because you told me how much you didn't want to do it. Like the writing of it was good,

**01:01:07** even though, as I said to you beforehand, that was the part that I just did not understand. Right.

**01:01:12** And like I, I, I enjoyed the watching of it, but that part I didn't get it. It just went over my

**01:01:19** head. That happens to me with those kinds of topics anyway. And, you know, I just want to be clear

**01:01:24** for you and for the viewers. There's a reason that I often haven't done physics stuff. And

**01:01:32** this moment here where you're like, Oh, I don't understand that section. That is not your fault,

**01:01:37** because the actual explanation that I have given is not an adequate explanation of why is this

**01:01:44** occurring. So I think like this is just a problem, especially in a lot of science communication

**01:01:52** where you can explain something in the simplest way that's possible. But I think you can often

**01:02:01** end up being more confused by the simple explanation than you would be by the raw explanation.

**01:02:08** It's just that the raw explanation takes more time. Because I guess with the simple explanation,

**01:02:12** you're just being told, right? Yeah, you're being told you don't have the opportunity to

**01:02:17** come to it on your own or like, you're not given the tools to be able to work it out, right? You

**01:02:22** just, this is true. Believe it. So like there's a thing in the video where I talk about like, okay,

**01:02:27** because the world is spinning, it makes these coils of current rotate their position. The way I say

**01:02:35** it in the video, I'm kind of expecting that for some viewers, they have a little bit of an intuitive

**01:02:42** sense that that's what happens. Like, oh, if you spin something this way, like a thing moves in an

**01:02:48** opposite direction, but tons of people won't have that intuitive sense. And there's no reason that

**01:02:51** they would. And I'm just saying twice that this is a thing that happens. So when you hear it the

**01:02:58** second time, it's not like it's a trick, but I'm partly relying on the fact of we've been through

**01:03:05** this before, right? We talked about this earlier that when the earth spins, it causes these trade

**01:03:11** winds to happen. And so now later in the video, when the earth spins, it causes these coils to

**01:03:17** rotate into the position that they're supposed to be just like what happens with the wind before.

**01:03:21** But if you pause for a second and you go, Hey, yeah, wait a minute. But like, why, right? Why

**01:03:26** does it rotate in this different direction? The answer there is like, well, we would have to talk

**01:03:30** about rotational inertia. Like we could explain this, but now the video needs to be an hour long.

**01:03:37** This is how you get to four hour YouTube videos.

**01:03:40** Right. This is how you get to a four hour YouTube video. I don't know. I feel quite

**01:03:42** passionate about this because this is going back to my time as a physics teacher. There was a thing

**01:03:48** that I always found really frustrating with GCSE physics in the UK, where there's a lot of times

**01:03:54** where they were like the curriculum as, as mandated was trying to make some physics things

**01:04:01** simple. But by making them simple, I could see that it routinely tripped up the smarter kids in

**01:04:08** the class, right? Because they could tell that like something's not right here or something

**01:04:14** hasn't been fully explained here. And like, it was a very frequent pattern. That's like, okay,

**01:04:20** by making this simple, you've actually made it harder for the kids who you most want to get

**01:04:27** into this topic because they can feel like, wait, but you haven't actually explained something.

**01:04:33** I feel like in school, I was always repelled by the, it just is topics. So I got to a point

**01:04:39** in, in mass and I was like, I can't, like when we get to like algebra and stuff like that,

**01:04:45** it was just like, I can't, I can't conceive of this. Like I don't, it doesn't make any sense to

**01:04:49** me that I couldn't see the logic in it. And I have no doubt that it's there, but it just

**01:04:55** wasn't taught to me. Math is a horrifying special case because that actually is at the very bottom

**01:05:03** of math is like, well, it just is. We actually just defined the system this way and you can

**01:05:06** define math to be any way that you wanted it to be. Right. Is the, is the ultimate answer.

**01:05:09** Yeah. It is like, oh, we only happen to use this subset of math that works out for the real world.

**01:05:14** But yes, at the bottom of math is like, this isn't actually connected to anything real in any

**01:05:20** actual way is the true horrifying answer. So yeah, math is particularly weird with that. But yeah,

**01:05:25** so, so all of this is to say, like, if you watch that section, that's the physics section and you

**01:05:30** say like, Oh, I don't get this part. I think you're correct. Ultimately, I have not adequately

**01:05:37** explained what is really occurring in that section. But that's by design. It's not by design. It's

**01:05:44** just by, by practicality of it. Right. But that's what I mean. Like you, you have, you've made a

**01:05:48** decision, right? That like, this is not going to be a 37 minute video. Yeah. This is, this is also

**01:05:54** why I avoided that section because I know I'm ultimately going to have to push up against these

**01:05:58** little parts where you say like, okay, look, we're not, we're not going to explain rotational

**01:06:03** inertia. There's all sorts of things in there where it's like, we're just not going to explain

**01:06:06** them and we're going to have to move on. Now, like part of the reason that I think

**01:06:12** that that section does work and I, and I was happy to leave it in is because this, this idea in some

**01:06:18** ways is I think something that you can take from that section, even if the mechanics of like, wait,

**01:06:24** how does the earth have a magnetic field? Does it quite make sense? You can still take from it.

**01:06:30** Like, Hey, if you keep asking why questions, you're going to get to the bottom of the universe

**01:06:35** and why means nothing here. That's actually the answer to all of your questions.

**01:06:40** So I'm happy to have that section in there. Cause I think that there still is something else to,

**01:06:45** to get out of it, but it is the section that I was worried the most about for a lot of different

**01:06:50** reasons. And, and one of them is like, Oh, it's just not possible to adequately explain this.

**01:06:55** And even the simple explanation, which is blowing past a lot of stuff, it's still long. Like there's

**01:07:03** still a lot to get through in that whole part. So yeah, I didn't want to have it put in there.

**01:07:08** Right up until the 11th hour. I kept thinking it was a mistake to have that section in there. And

**01:07:12** it was really only in the last couple of days before upload where I finally got happy with it

**01:07:16** and thought, okay, even if this video bombs, I will be content with feeling like it wasn't because

**01:07:24** the last section was terrible. Like I got it to a place where I was happy with it and thought,

**01:07:28** I will put this up and we'll see how it goes. Many opportunities for a viewer to

**01:07:34** click away in a three in one structure. I feel like it was a, that was a high risk move. And

**01:07:41** there is a alternate universe gray who is like crying into his microphone right now because the

**01:07:47** video is just watched by no one because they were clicking away and it didn't work. Like it could

**01:07:52** have easily gone in a different direction. If you point the microphone down towards you,

**01:07:57** less likelihood of the crying into right the tears don't fall into the microphone. So once again,

**01:08:02** above. If you're a sad podcast, you want to go up pointing down. It's good advice. Listen to Mike

**01:08:08** for his microphone advice. This episode of Cortex is brought to you by Sourcegraph. So you've hired

**01:08:13** a brilliant developer. That's great, but now you have to get them on boarded. If your company is

**01:08:17** growing on boarding, new developers will be a common occurrence, but it's a big undertaking

**01:08:22** each time. One of the biggest challenges for new hires to get up to speed with the project that

**01:08:26** their new teams working on. This can be tricky if the code base is not working. If you're

**01:08:30** working on boarding, this can be tricky if the code base is that your developers are working in

**01:08:34** already large. Thankfully, Sourcegraph makes it easy to move fast even in those big code bases.

**01:08:40** Developers know that knowledge is most useful when it's findable. Centralization is helpful,

**01:08:45** but given the fact that most companies store knowledge in at least two different locations,

**01:08:49** how do you make knowledge accessible to those that need it? As a code intelligence platform,

**01:08:54** Sourcegraph gives developers what they need to drive their own learning over time in different

**01:08:58** teams. Teams of Sourcegraph need to rely on asking colleagues or reviewing out-of-date

**01:09:02** documentation, which is cumbersome and time-consuming. But with Sourcegraph, every

**01:09:06** developer can search across millions of repositories to find specific code,

**01:09:10** saving time for themselves and everyone else. So when questions do come up, you know it's the big

**01:09:15** stuff worthy of the extra time. Sourcegraph was created to make developers' lives easier,

**01:09:20** and today they work with leading companies across every industry, including three out of the five top

**01:09:25** tech companies, plus PayPal, Uber, Plaid, GE, Reddit and Atlassian. Visit about.sourcegraph.com

**01:09:37** in the world use Sourcegraph and to see what it can do for yours. Or you could just click the

**01:09:42** link in our show notes to let them know that you heard about them from us. Our thanks to Sourcegraph

**01:09:46** for the support of this show and Relay FM. Let's do some Ask Cortex questions. Okay.

**01:09:52** What tickles your fancy? Not because I have a good answer, but just because I think it's funny.

**01:09:56** Tony here wants to know how many secret projects do you have at this moment? Oh,

**01:10:00** that's a good question. This is like a perpetually differing thing depending on time of the year.

**01:10:08** And so here's the second subset questions I have here so we can try and define this. Personal

**01:10:13** projects, primary business projects, secondary business projects, right? So like primary being

**01:10:22** YouTube for you, Relay for me, secondary being for both of us, Cortex brand. Just the way that

**01:10:30** you feel like, Oh man, I've got to really start getting on all these categories for all my secret

**01:10:34** projects tells me you have a lot of secret projects going on. No, I'm just like seeing like,

**01:10:39** these are the areas we're going to talk about, right? Cause I have two secret personal projects

**01:10:44** and I'm working on. So I just was wondering if personal was going to be in the top secret

**01:10:49** project categories. I'm wondering what your secret personal projects are. I'm trying to think about

**01:10:54** what we were talking about. One of them today, the other one we have spoken about, but it's

**01:10:58** probably not coming into your mind. Right. So we've got two personal secret projects, like pottery

**01:11:04** lessons. You know, I did that wasn't it, but like, did I tell you we went and did another one in

**01:11:09** London? Like the final studio and we did, it was awesome. It was so good. And I, once I actually get

**01:11:16** secret project one out of the way, that is, I need to get back to that. It was so good. Oh my God.

**01:11:23** I love it so much. I would say I have one Relay secret project, which is way fewer than normal

**01:11:31** because I'm trying to structure it. Right. Just calm all of that down. Cortex brand.

**01:11:39** Like there's two in cortex. Well, I was going to say four. Okay. Right. But they're like,

**01:11:44** you've got from a case of like secret project one currently in manufacturing,

**01:11:50** secret project two is like the next one. And then three, you know what I mean? Like they're just like

**01:11:57** things that we haven't started, but we know we want to do. Yeah. That's what I was thinking

**01:12:02** of is secret project in manufacturing and then there's secret project next up. That's what I was

**01:12:06** thinking of for two, but I know of like our next three things that I want to work on. I don't know

**01:12:11** if they're going to be the next three things that we do. So yeah, that's me. What about you? I mean,

**01:12:16** yeah. So I've got the cortex secret projects, obviously. Yeah, we share. It's funny because

**01:12:20** I really just wanted to quickly say that Tony is like, nice try Tony, or I try to find out the

**01:12:25** secrets. But I think the actuality of it is that today, personally, right now, in terms of what I'm

**01:12:31** up to, aside from the cortex stuff, I don't have any secret projects. And that is solely because

**01:12:37** I'm in that weird transition window where the video has gone up, but I have not decided what

**01:12:44** the next project is going to be. I was playing around with some possibilities this morning of

**01:12:49** like trying to scry around and feel like what's, what's soon, what should be later? Like what should

**01:12:53** I work on? This is actually part of new decades dawn is trying to be much more deliberate before I

**01:13:00** switch to the next thing. So I technically currently have no secret projects because

**01:13:07** I haven't settled on like, okay, this is the next video and I'm going to going to work on that. So

**01:13:13** currently none. I'm giving you full control today over the question pecking. No, I don't want that

**01:13:19** kind of pressure. Um, okay. So here's an interesting one. This is from Lewis. What was

**01:13:24** the last thing you have learned from zero? So like an example, learning to play an instrument

**01:13:30** without knowing anything about music. Is this something you do often? No, what I will say

**01:13:38** for this one is soldering. Oh, that's actually, that's a good one. I would say in the time of

**01:13:45** my life right now, I have the feeling more of wanting to learn things for the sake and

**01:13:53** fun of learning them. What do you mean? Not to do anything with it. Oh, okay. Like there's just

**01:13:57** stuff I want to learn. Like right now I've just been learning more about coffee, even though I

**01:14:01** haven't actually actioned it or not necessarily want to action it. I just want, I'm just interested

**01:14:06** in the information. But soldering is the thing that I feel like I have learned from zero, uh,

**01:14:13** most recently to the point where like I now consider it a skill that I have and I've done

**01:14:20** enough variants of it and like weird things like drag soldering, which is like a whole other subset

**01:14:27** of it. And I've done this a couple of times at a point where I feel confident that like, if you sit

**01:14:31** me down and be like, can you sort of this? I know what to do. What is drag soldering? I've never

**01:14:36** heard of that before. It's you have to use a different compound where you use it. Sordering

**01:14:42** sort of has something called flux in it, which is like kind of like a wax. And I don't, I'll be

**01:14:47** honest. I don't know what it actually does. I think it like helps the spread of the sorta. And it's

**01:14:52** like to contain it. It's where like, if you have pins like flat pins where you have to sort of a

**01:14:59** bunch of them at once, like imagine like on a USB connector or something. So like if to sort of a USB

**01:15:05** connector to a board rather than it being like a one to one point that you're soldering together

**01:15:09** with wire, they're like all these little points that you have to contact pads after touch each

**01:15:14** other. So this is where you apply a bunch of the flux stuff that when you then actually apply the

**01:15:20** sorta wire, it pulls around the contact areas as opposed to around the surrounding area. So if

**01:15:28** you're, if you're soldering something that's really tiny, it gives you kind of like a freedom. Oh,

**01:15:34** okay. I know I'm doing a very bad job explaining this. So I will find a YouTube video to put in

**01:15:40** the show notes. So if you're listening to me, you'd be like, Mike, you don't know how to explain this.

**01:15:44** Yes, I don't know how to explain this, but I'm just trying my best. So it gives you a lot of,

**01:15:48** it gives you some leeway basically to apply sorta to things that are very tiny that would otherwise

**01:15:54** be really, really hard to do. This was very intimidating to me because it was nothing like

**01:15:59** what I'd learned, but I did it and it worked. Yeah. And I've done sorting of very tiny components

**01:16:05** and larger components. So like, I feel like especially around keyboard stuff now, if it's

**01:16:10** just like, you've got to sort of this, like, it's like, yeah, I can work this out. And I've gotten

**01:16:13** to the point with it where I understand that even though this seems like very complex and daunting

**01:16:19** technology, it's actually like one of the more basic kind of brutal kind of ways of dealing with

**01:16:25** technology where like you do not have to be perfect to get this to work. You can be very

**01:16:31** clumsy and get it to work. Yeah. And I kind of like that about it. Yeah. So soldering is pretty

**01:16:37** forgiving as far as these things go. Yeah. It's genuinely one of the things I love about it. You

**01:16:41** can be really messy and really bad, but you can still work because that you can, it's very forgiving.

**01:16:48** I find that you must have this all the time though, right? Learning things from zero. Well,

**01:16:52** so no, like I would just assume that you'd consider this part of your job. I feel like you

**01:16:56** have an answer there, which is what this question is trying to get out, which is like a skill.

**01:17:00** Right. On your character sheet, like what skills do you have listed? So sold soldering, I always

**01:17:06** have a hard time saying ice terrible is soldering soldering soldering. I've always, I've always had

**01:17:12** this because it's also like the way it is in my head is not the way that it's written on the page.

**01:17:15** Also, I believe in the UK, it is soldering. Is that okay? Right. So, but I only ever really

**01:17:23** hear Americans say it from when I was learning. And so I say soldering. Yeah. And that is one

**01:17:29** of these things that I say to British people and they're like, what are you saying? What's wrong

**01:17:32** with you? You know? Yeah. So soldering is a skill that you have on a sheet. Like it's a thing that

**01:17:38** you can do. Hey, my keyboard's broken. You can fix it. Yeah. I feel like that's what this question

**01:17:44** is kind of getting at. So I draw a very strong distinction between learning how to and learning

**01:17:52** about. And I think what most people do most of the time is that they learn about a thing and learning

**01:18:00** how to is a way smaller section of what people spend time learning. So I feel like the spirit

**01:18:07** of this question is a how to question. It's not about, so I don't regard anything that I've done

**01:18:11** in terms of the videos like that, right? This is learning about, it's not learning how to.

**01:18:17** Honestly, probably the closest thing I would have as an answer to this question is streaming. I

**01:18:24** learned how to stream. Did you? I know Mike's going to give me a really hard time. Okay. I try

**01:18:33** to bring it up, but I genuinely think that's like the closest how to in a long time. Now,

**01:18:40** you know how to do it most of the time. It's the technology that you use is creating a bad

**01:18:46** environment for you. Yeah. I was trying to think about like the closest thing earlier to that that

**01:18:50** I could think of is, I mean, this is years ago now, but I was teaching myself how to edit videos

**01:18:56** with Adobe Premiere instead of using Final Cut when I was a little bit worried that Final Cut

**01:19:00** was just abandonware. Yeah. And Apple has totally turned that around in the best of all possible

**01:19:05** ways. So, but prior to streaming, I think like that's the closest and that does not count as

**01:19:10** from zero because I've already had a ton of concepts in my head about video editing.

**01:19:14** I would say streaming is a good one though, because it's not just a technical thing. It's

**01:19:19** not just a practical thing. There's like a mentality to it. Yeah. That like you really

**01:19:24** displayed in the Minecraft streams those days of your that felt like that feels like forever ago.

**01:19:30** Yeah. You were streaming Minecraft and like calling out your subs and stuff, you know?

**01:19:34** Yeah. There is a whole mindset of it, which I do still feel like I haven't quite gotten fully,

**01:19:39** but it is a kind of skill. There's ways to obviously do it badly and there's ways to do

**01:19:44** it better. But I just want to mention here, it's worth thinking about that. It should be true in

**01:19:50** the arc of your life that you do way more of learning how to at the beginning and way less

**01:19:57** at toward the end. Basically, this is called like an explore exploit algorithm where you have a

**01:20:04** computer program and you're trying to figure out like, oh, you want to get a bunch of resources

**01:20:07** out of a particular area. How much time do you spend exploring versus how much time do you spend

**01:20:13** exploiting a known resource? I feel like the example that's usually used is like squirrels

**01:20:18** finding trees that have lots of nuts in them. Like how much time do you spend exploring new trees?

**01:20:23** How much time do you spend exploiting trees where you found nuts? And this is like the course of a

**01:20:28** human career, right? You spend time exploring at the beginning, but you should spend the vast

**01:20:35** majority of your time exploiting the tools and abilities that you have found and developed.

**01:20:41** I think that that's useful to keep in mind because it can kind of be a weird transition

**01:20:46** when you leave school or a couple of years into your career. Like I think a lot of people do get

**01:20:51** that feeling of like, oh, I haven't learned anything new or I haven't learned any brand new

**01:20:57** skills from zero. And I'm not saying that like the number of skills you should pick up should

**01:21:03** be zero, but you should spend the vast majority of your time, like exploiting the pre-existing skills

**01:21:12** that you have. And you shouldn't necessarily feel guilty for like not picking up a bunch of new ones,

**01:21:18** which is why I can say like very comfortably, like streaming barely counts as a new skill.

**01:21:24** And if we skip past that one, it's like my list of new how to's in a real meaningful way is like

**01:21:32** very thin for a long time. And I'm perfectly fine with that because I feel like I'm exploiting a

**01:21:38** bunch of skills that I have already developed and have. And I just think that's useful to think

**01:21:43** about in terms of how careers and how life goes. And picking a little? No, you have to pick one now.

**01:21:49** I picked two. I picked two in a row. I didn't ask for why do I look, I've never had full control

**01:21:55** in a Q and A before. Like this is ridiculous. What do you mean you don't have full control in

**01:21:59** a Q and A? If I ask you a question, you don't want to answer. You say I'm not going to answer that.

**01:22:02** That's full control. No, that's veto power. Isn't veto power technically full control?

**01:22:10** I feel like there's some subtle differences here. But isn't the end result the same?

**01:22:14** Yes, the end result is the same. That's true. It's full control while like leaning back in a chair.

**01:22:21** That's what veto power is. No, no, no. Come on, pick another one. Okay. Oh, I can actually just

**01:22:26** answer this one really quickly. Adam wants to know, have either of you heard of or used the

**01:22:31** remarkable tablet? Have you come across that one, Mike? I mean, I'm on Instagram, so I get the ads

**01:22:36** every day. Oh, is this like a big Instagram? I don't know if it's like they advertise to me

**01:22:41** personally, very aggressively. Like I get served ads for the remarkable a lot. The remarkable is a

**01:22:49** E Ink tablet. There's a pen. You can take notes on it. You can read on it, that kind of stuff.

**01:22:56** Are you tempted at all? I'm intrigued. You're intrigued. Yes. But I'm not three, 400 pounds

**01:23:01** intrigued. Yeah, that's fair. I went to a conference and I sat next to a guy who was using one. I'd

**01:23:09** never seen or heard of it before. Apparently I don't spend enough time on Instagram. And of course,

**01:23:15** this poor person sitting next to me, I was like, what is that? And explain everything about it to

**01:23:20** me. Because it looks really cool. Like it's very interesting to see. Oh, it's a Kindle you can write

**01:23:26** on. That's amazing. I was really impressed with the latency. It did way better than I would have

**01:23:30** expected an E Ink screen to do. There was a lot of things that were really cool about it.

**01:23:35** I was extremely intrigued, but for me, the falling down part is just sinking back out. Like,

**01:23:43** how do you get things out of here that you have worked on? Okay. And it's not that they didn't

**01:23:48** have a bunch of options, but none of them would line up with the way that I would need or want

**01:23:52** them to work. So what do you want? That's a very complicated question. We're not going to get into

**01:23:57** right now. I mean, like, cause they say they've added support for like Dropbox and Google Drive

**01:24:03** and stuff. Yes. Yes. I understand that this is why I think for anyone who's intrigued by it,

**01:24:09** it probably would be a good idea, but I'm looking for very particular things with the way that I'm

**01:24:14** working with my scripts and how those scripts are sinking and also with multiple people.

**01:24:18** So like I just have a much more complicated problem that this can't solve in its current form.

**01:24:24** Somebody's built obsidian integration. Okay. This is getting closer, but still like, again,

**01:24:31** look, Mike, this is just like, we don't need to talk about rotational inertia in a video. Like,

**01:24:35** we don't need to talk about the exact details of what it is that I'm trying to do.

**01:24:38** Okay. This is one of those things where Mike is personally intrigued, right? Not about like,

**01:24:43** do I think this is interesting content? Because look, I am very interested by this thing and like,

**01:24:48** I don't know. But for me, it's like, I don't know what I would use it for. This is the reason that

**01:24:53** I've never progressed, right? Yeah. Because I don't use my Apple pencil on my iPad enough. I feel

**01:24:59** like, right? So the reason I put this in a document is I was interested if you have ever considered it

**01:25:04** for like script annotation stuff. Oh yeah. That is 100% what I would want to use it for.

**01:25:10** The problem is, I don't know, this is more like state of the apps later in the year.

**01:25:15** Okay. So here's the workflow that I want is I want to export a PDF of the document that I'm

**01:25:24** working on in Obsidian, the current script. And then I want to take that PDF and mark it up. So

**01:25:29** even just like with my iPad, right? I just want to mark it up with the iPad. I then want to send

**01:25:34** that PDF to my assistant who will make all of the changes on the text file the PDF was generated

**01:25:43** from. And that's the part where it fails. There's no good way to give her access to the Obsidian

**01:25:52** files that I'm working on that also allows Obsidian to sync between all of my devices

**01:26:00** without also giving her what is the current state of it? I think I would need to give her the entire

**01:26:07** Obsidian database, which I just don't want to do for many reasons, because it's just like

**01:26:12** this horrific spider web of thousands of documents that can go wrong.

**01:26:17** Yeah, because Obsidian is an app for hoarders. Well, Mike, I think that's a little bit unfair.

**01:26:21** No, I don't think it's unfair at all. It's just like it's way too high stakes for something to

**01:26:30** go wrong at this point. I'm lost as why is this a problem with the Remarkable? Well, because the

**01:26:35** Remarkable has the same issue of ultimately, it's not the issue of marking it up. The thing that's

**01:26:40** actually the problem is getting the corrections back into my system. So it doesn't have anything

**01:26:46** to do with how am I marking the thing up? It's right now, it's extremely clunky to get changes

**01:26:52** back into Obsidian. That's where the issue is. But isn't that a problem no matter what you use?

**01:26:57** Yes, exactly. But that's why I'm saying like, I don't do this enough, because there's a different

**01:27:02** problem. If I was able to solve this different problem, the Remarkable might totally work for

**01:27:07** me and I would use it. Okay. But I can't get that last like, how does she make changes on a text

**01:27:14** document in my Obsidian without also having access to the entire Obsidian? Like I just want her to

**01:27:21** have access to a subsection of the files. I feel stupid here. Yeah. Because I feel like I'm getting

**01:27:26** lost or something. How are you currently doing it then? Currently, this is the whole thing. I would

**01:27:32** like to do this way more, but I've only done it a handful of times in the last two years because

**01:27:38** it's so much of a pain in the butt. And when we do it, it's by manually copying the text file for

**01:27:45** her to edit. And then I'm like copy pasting back the text file into my own system, which is just,

**01:27:51** it's not good. We also run into, because often the text editing is being done in a Windows system,

**01:27:57** there's slightly different encoding systems for text files between Windows and here. So it's like,

**01:28:02** it's almost exactly formatted the way I like everything formatted, but not quite, which is

**01:28:07** an annoying distraction when I'm then going to re-edit the file itself. There's just like a

**01:28:12** thousand little tiny things. You should use craft. This is not state of the apps, Mike.

**01:28:19** I know, but we've got months before we do that. Because if you used craft, they could edit it on

**01:28:23** the web or even Google docs. Like why don't you use Google docs? Because I want, I want the script.

**01:28:31** Okay. Look, I have been thinking about maybe breaking this for this part.

**01:28:35** The question is, do I separate out the scripts from all of the other documents in Obsidian?

**01:28:42** I think once you've gotten to a script, to a point where like this script is ready for others to see,

**01:28:48** it has to leave the siloed application. No, it doesn't have to leave the siloed application.

**01:28:52** No, I haven't had it been leaving the siloed application.

**01:28:54** No one's looking at it, are they? It can stay right in there, right? It's perfectly fine.

**01:28:58** Right. But then it's just you, right? You can keep it in there, but then no one can look at it.

**01:29:03** Right. Exactly.

**01:29:05** This is a choice you need to make. Do you want other people to look at them?

**01:29:08** No, I know. But this is the whole, this is the whole reason that I moved to Obsidian in the first

**01:29:14** place. Is there are big advantages from my perspective while working on projects to have

**01:29:20** scripts and notes in the same place. And like this.

**01:29:27** But why does it need to, like, okay, at the moment where you've decided

**01:29:32** somebody else needs to see this, can't you just like off board it to a thing and then when it's

**01:29:36** done, bring it back. That is what we are currently doing. Right. But it is a real pain. It's just,

**01:29:45** it's very annoying to do. It slows down things. It introduces weird text encoding problems as well.

**01:29:51** Maybe Obsidian is the wrong app. You know what I mean? No, but you still listen.

**01:29:56** Damn it.

**01:29:59** This is, look, this is my, this is my one problem with my current system is, and also like, I know

**01:30:07** full well, my use case here is crazy niche. So like, I'm not expecting anything.

**01:30:11** I don't think so at all.

**01:30:12** You don't think this is what collaboration on a document. That's not, that's like,

**01:30:18** no, no, the way, no, the way you're framing that there is getting, is blowing past all of

**01:30:22** the important things is collaboration on a document in Obsidian, but only a small section

**01:30:28** of the Obsidian vault. Not the whole thing. I don't think this is wild at all. This seems

**01:30:33** like a very valid use case for me that somebody has a document in their Obsidian. You call it a vault.

**01:30:39** I assume that's what they're called then. It just means the folder with all the stuff.

**01:30:43** So that they want to share with someone to work on, but doesn't want to give them full access to

**01:30:48** their Obsidian. So all of the links are removed from the, what the person views. I don't know.

**01:30:53** This seems pretty obvious to me. I mean, I don't imagine it's easy to build, but considering this

**01:30:58** thing is mostly web technologies, like seems possible that, cause these, these, all of these

**01:31:04** things exist on the web. It seems good, but it's on the web.

**01:31:09** Yeah. I mean, again, part of the issue here is that Obsidian's big selling feature is that it

**01:31:14** is your files on your computer. It's not like a Google docs, right? It's not where everything is

**01:31:19** in the web. It's very specifically local syncing of all of your files. This is why I guess we're

**01:31:25** going to talk about it. Or is it just syncing changes? Cause they Obsidian sync, right? What

**01:31:31** is that doing then? They do have Obsidian sync. I'm under the impression that they're just syncing

**01:31:35** changes there. I could be wrong. Right. But you could in theory though, share, but you don't want

**01:31:41** to share the Dropbox thing with someone. Well, okay. So Obsidian, when they moved,

**01:31:46** when they rolled out the Obsidian sync, they deprecated Dropbox as a syncing option.

**01:31:51** So the two options for syncing are iCloud or the Obsidian sync system. And iCloud doesn't let you

**01:31:58** go like, Hey, I want to let someone have access to this one subfolder inside this whole thing.

**01:32:02** I mean, honestly, if that's the case, then I feel like we've Obsidian sync, there should be a way

**01:32:06** for somebody to be able to collaborate. Like that should be a thing that they should work on.

**01:32:10** Okay. I'll add it to the feature request then I'll put that on there. But I just, I just feel

**01:32:14** like it's going to be something that they've heard a billion times, like that people want

**01:32:18** collaboration. I'm not convinced because you know why Mike Obsidian is an application for

**01:32:23** individual weirdo hoarders who all have their own crazy system. And it's just like, everything about

**01:32:28** the app seems anti a bunch of people. I mean, I just searched collaboration on the forum and

**01:32:34** there's lots of posts about people wanting collaboration. It has been labeled as a valuable

**01:32:39** feature request. Apparently, whatever that means. It's like, that sounds like a no thanks,

**01:32:45** a kind of comment, right? We'll consider your feature request, but yeah, I don't know. Like

**01:32:49** I feel like if a text editing thing these days collaboration is important as well. Like I thought

**01:32:55** of craft, right? Like I know craft is different, but I know it also has some overlaps with what

**01:33:00** Obsidian does like the linking between notes and stuff. And craft is very good at the collaboration

**01:33:07** to the point of like, you can share an entire database or somebody or every note you can create

**01:33:16** a collaborative version for on the web. And it's awesome. Because I mean, I use it and I've used

**01:33:24** it with you, right? Like I keep all of the cortex brand stuff in craft and I've shared with you.

**01:33:30** And with your assistant some notes and their secret note links only available like in a kind

**01:33:36** of a Google Docs way to people that have the URL. And then I can choose if they can update it or

**01:33:41** not. That stuff they're like pushing further into it. I feel like Obsidian has got to get on that

**01:33:46** train because if they don't, I don't know, I feel like someone's going to come along and take it

**01:33:50** from them because it seems I don't know, it's just if you're making if people writing their

**01:33:58** magnum opuses inside of this application, I just feel like the ability to share a document with

**01:34:02** somebody else. I don't know, it seems pretty important. But this has got nothing to do with

**01:34:08** the remarkable. All of this has got nothing to do with the remarkable. Right. But that's why I'm

**01:34:13** saying it's like I'm intrigued by the remarkable, but I have a different problem that like precedes

**01:34:20** even getting it right. Otherwise, you must be doing something like the script markup is not

**01:34:28** happening because of this. It is happening way less frequently than it should be happening.

**01:34:33** Like the friction of this has made it like, okay, I'll do this once on each of the scripts now.

**01:34:39** Yeah, I feel like you should be taking the completed draft out of Obsidian,

**01:34:45** putting it somewhere that share a port and then having a better flow.

**01:34:49** Yes, I understand. I understand. I like, look, I just want to get all the, I will just argue that the

**01:34:56** the advantage of having it all in one place is that it is not always as clear as you might imagine

**01:35:03** when something is a script and when something is not a script. And so being able to jump around

**01:35:08** between different things in the same application is really useful. Yeah, sure. I would say at the

**01:35:14** point that you feel like you want to share it with someone, that's the point that needs to leave

**01:35:18** because the application that you've gone all in on that's now failing you doesn't allow for

**01:35:23** collaboration. So I feel like at the point where you're like, Oh, assistant or fact checker would

**01:35:28** be good to see this document. Well, then it should leave Obsidian because Obsidian can't do that. It's

**01:35:35** like sesame knife, but it's lost the corkscrew or something, you know, I know that you're right.

**01:35:41** And I don't want you to be right. I wasn't expecting this to be the conversation that

**01:35:48** came out of have you tried the ink tablet? I just wanted to say, Oh, I've seen it. It looks cool,

**01:35:54** but it's not for me. I've seen it and I think it looks cool, but I don't have a use for it. For me,

**01:35:59** where this would be incredibly useful is if they could do something that is no way they could

**01:36:03** possibly do it, which is let me mark up Kindle books. Like they have E-POPs, right? But not

**01:36:09** Kindle books. If Amazon made this thing, I would be more interested. Right? Yeah. Because if I'm

**01:36:15** buying an ebook, I'm getting a Kindle book. Like that's just because I'm just in on that. Right?

**01:36:21** Like, of course, this is what I'm, this is Amazon's whole thing. I'm intrigued by it. You know, like

**01:36:26** the things that I will, it's not going to feel like paper and pen, right? Like everyone tries to show

**01:36:30** you these things feel like paper and pen. They don't feel like paper and pen. It might feel better.

**01:36:34** I'm sure it feel more like it, but it's not going to feel like it. Right. Like it's not going to feel

**01:36:38** like writing on a glass screen because it isn't a glass screen. So that might feel nicer. But you

**01:36:44** know, they call it a paper like surface. It definitely doesn't have a paper like surface.

**01:36:48** It will have just like a matte surface, which would be different to a glass surface. And I believe

**01:36:53** them that I bet it's much, much easier to read in sunlight because there's no backlight. So that's

**01:36:57** funny. They say no glare or backlight as like a pro. It's also a con. It means you can't see it if

**01:37:04** it's dark. Right. Like, like, I'm sure that it's nice for you if you are sitting by the pool and

**01:37:10** reading, but if you're in a dimly lit room, well, I'm sorry, this isn't going to work for you anymore.

**01:37:15** I think you should get one of these and solve your sinking problem.

**01:37:18** Yes, these are two separate things, by the way, getting one of these to solve a sinking problem.

**01:37:22** I'll look into that.
