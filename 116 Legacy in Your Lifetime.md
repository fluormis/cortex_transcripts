# Cortex - 116: Legacy in Your Lifetime
**00:00:00** I'm ready to go.

**00:00:01** Okay.

**00:00:02** Welcome to Cortex.

**00:00:03** What is that?

**00:00:04** Is that the-

**00:00:05** Mike, isn't that how we start the show every episode?

**00:00:06** One of us says welcome to Cortex.

**00:00:07** Isn't that what we do every time?

**00:00:09** I think we can only really start the show this way if this was the last episode of Cortex

**00:00:13** because it would dovetail with the very first episode.

**00:00:17** So the kind of cold open, as we would call it, the introduction to the very first episode

**00:00:23** is me not knowing how to start the show.

**00:00:25** Right.

**00:00:26** And me not helping you at all.

**00:00:27** At all.

**00:00:28** I think that's what's sitting there.

**00:00:29** Sitting there like, this is his problem.

**00:00:32** You're just making fun of me.

**00:00:33** I've heard this clip a billion times because-

**00:00:37** Why?

**00:00:38** Every time I post the episode to the YouTube channel, I can never remember how I format

**00:00:43** the title.

**00:00:44** Okay.

**00:00:45** It's like the pound sign number colon name.

**00:00:48** That's how we usually do it.

**00:00:49** But I'm always like, do I do a pound sign or do I not do that?

**00:00:52** Do I just do- I can never remember.

**00:00:54** And every single time I go and check.

**00:00:56** So when I go to the YouTube page, the intro of the first episode starts playing immediately.

**00:01:01** It's the channel trailer.

**00:01:02** Right.

**00:01:03** Of course.

**00:01:04** So every time I post an episode of Cortex, I hear like the first 20 seconds of the original

**00:01:10** episode.

**00:01:14** You're going to be really natural right now.

**00:01:16** That's what you're going to do.

**00:01:17** This is supernatural.

**00:01:18** Okay.

**00:01:19** Go for it.

**00:01:21** So I know that in that episode, you're like making fun of me because I'm not sure how

**00:01:25** to start the show because all of my other shows, it's like from Relay FM, this is whatever.

**00:01:31** Right.

**00:01:32** But we just start.

**00:01:33** So the idea of you now creating a welcome to Cortex, you know, this is episode 116.

**00:01:38** It's like, I feel like we could only really pull that joke off if this was the final episode

**00:01:43** of the show.

**00:01:44** We always do this, Mike.

**00:01:45** You're just forgetting.

**00:01:46** You know, we do levels, levels, then it's quiet on set and then it's welcome to Cortex,

**00:01:52** right?

**00:01:53** Just like a real show.

**00:01:54** Quiet on set.

**00:01:55** I'm sorry you have to listen to the first few seconds of that episode.

**00:01:59** I do intentionally rotate on my own channel, whatever video is up as that channel trailer

**00:02:04** thing on YouTube.

**00:02:05** Yeah.

**00:02:06** Because it's the same thing.

**00:02:07** Like I go to my own channel a thousand times to adjust things or to fix things or to get

**00:02:10** data from the backend or whatever.

**00:02:12** And I just, I cannot listen to the first 10 seconds of the same video all the time.

**00:02:16** Like at some point I just go, no, I can't take it.

**00:02:19** I have to change it.

**00:02:20** I would assume, I'm going to your channel now.

**00:02:22** I would assume it's your most recent video right now.

**00:02:25** Now I've left the Q&A one up for a little while.

**00:02:28** I feel like the 10 year Q&A, I feel like has a bit of a shelf life for being the top video

**00:02:33** for a bit, but I'll change it at some point when I get tired of however I started that

**00:02:36** video.

**00:02:37** But no, it's not the most recent video.

**00:02:38** Your most recent video feels like a campaign.

**00:02:42** Actually, it is a campaign.

**00:02:44** You're starting a campaign.

**00:02:46** Campaign for human decency.

**00:02:47** That's what it is, Mike.

**00:02:49** So I mean, my only assumption here could be that you came across some news stories

**00:02:53** about school days being canceled.

**00:02:55** I saw that this was happening in like New York or something because I went Googling

**00:02:59** after I watched your video.

**00:03:01** Right.

**00:03:02** What's he so mad about?

**00:03:03** I'm expecting this was a pretty quick turnaround video.

**00:03:05** Yeah.

**00:03:06** Yeah.

**00:03:07** This was not months of research.

**00:03:08** No, I've been in a low key way coming across this idea for the past few months.

**00:03:14** I just seen it mentioned in a few places where like some school district had canceled

**00:03:18** snow days.

**00:03:19** I think it had never quite like fully gotten into my brain, but I've seen this in a few

**00:03:26** places where school districts are deciding, oh, distance learning is great.

**00:03:30** But yeah, it was New York's announcements.

**00:03:33** My home state of New York committing such an atrocity, deciding that yes, there would

**00:03:38** be no more snow days.

**00:03:39** There would instead be distance learning days.

**00:03:42** And it was one of those things where I happened to read an article about it literally as I

**00:03:47** was drifting off to bed, you know, just like going through my reader queue of articles

**00:03:51** and things to read and fell asleep.

**00:03:55** Probably that was the last thing that I read and woke up furious.

**00:04:00** I don't know if you ever have this, but I just popped out of bed full of anger just

**00:04:05** immediately like they've canceled snow days.

**00:04:08** This is outrageous.

**00:04:11** This went from zero to a hundred in the moments where I came conscious.

**00:04:16** And I think maybe in the space of just two hours, I wrote that script.

**00:04:21** I messaged my animator because this was on Sunday, I think.

**00:04:25** And I said, Hey, I'm so mad.

**00:04:27** I mean, I think again, as anyone who has listened to many hours of cortex can probably infer,

**00:04:36** sometimes I may not be the easiest person to work with and things can come out of nowhere.

**00:04:43** This is one of those moments of yes, like you've summed it up better than I could have.

**00:04:47** Hey, guess what?

**00:04:48** I'm angry.

**00:04:51** How fast can we make a thing?

**00:04:53** And he was on board with it.

**00:04:55** So it went out the next night, I think.

**00:04:58** I think it went out Monday night.

**00:04:59** Wow, that's speedy.

**00:05:01** Yes.

**00:05:02** Well, I was very much like, we're going to use all the animation tricks just to make

**00:05:05** this as fast as possible.

**00:05:06** Just everything to get it up on screen quickly.

**00:05:09** I would say the visuals of it is kind of like from an animation perspective, a CGP Grey

**00:05:14** made CGP Grey video would be.

**00:05:16** Yeah, for sure.

**00:05:17** But with the polish of your animation team.

**00:05:20** Yeah, for sure.

**00:05:21** And this little tricks you can do there, just having the window with snow in the background.

**00:05:26** We need the window with snow, right?

**00:05:28** So it sort of makes you feel like there's more motion than there really is.

**00:05:32** Yeah.

**00:05:33** I was trying to think about it.

**00:05:34** It's not the fastest creation to publication video, but I think it is the third fastest

**00:05:42** I've ever made a video.

**00:05:44** I think that's about right.

**00:05:45** What beats it?

**00:05:46** Well, there was that incident with the Fine Brothers years ago.

**00:05:50** Ah, yes.

**00:05:51** Yep.

**00:05:52** So those two videos beat it.

**00:05:53** The only other one that also beats it is, it's up on my second channel.

**00:05:57** It's the video where I show that the towels are fake in stores.

**00:06:00** I don't know if you've ever seen this one.

**00:06:02** It's like 20 seconds long, but I just point out that the-

**00:06:05** This doesn't count?

**00:06:06** That doesn't count?

**00:06:07** No, Mike, that is a video.

**00:06:09** Like 100%, I am counting that.

**00:06:11** I'm counting that as, that counts.

**00:06:14** I was out at the store.

**00:06:15** What about live streams then?

**00:06:17** They're like a media.

**00:06:18** No, Mike, live streams don't count at all.

**00:06:19** That's ridiculous.

**00:06:20** Live streams are in videos.

**00:06:22** Well, what about your Tesla cup holder videos?

**00:06:25** Is none of that?

**00:06:26** No, because the Tesla cup holder was part of the whole Tesla project.

**00:06:30** That doesn't count.

**00:06:31** The towels are a lie, that one, right?

**00:06:33** Yeah, the towels are a lie, which I also have to count because after all of these years,

**00:06:39** after all of the things that I have made, that video is still my wife's favorite video

**00:06:45** that I've ever made.

**00:06:46** Are you being serious?

**00:06:47** I am being 100% serious.

**00:06:50** I just recorded it in the store.

**00:06:53** And look, we are different people, me and you, right?

**00:06:56** Like we're made differently.

**00:06:58** That would greatly upset me.

**00:07:00** No, it's hilarious.

**00:07:01** It's so funny.

**00:07:02** No, this is what I'm saying.

**00:07:03** But like if Adina said to me like, oh, you remember that like 20 second clip that you

**00:07:09** put on Twitter once if you like blowing raspberries at someone or something, right?

**00:07:13** Like that's my favorite thing you've ever made.

**00:07:15** That would greatly upset me.

**00:07:17** There's so many hours I've worked over this content.

**00:07:19** Look, you know, as an internet creator, and this is the thing everyone who makes anything

**00:07:25** has to really deeply internalize.

**00:07:30** The world does not give a about how many hours you spent on anything.

**00:07:35** No, no, I know that.

**00:07:36** I know that.

**00:07:37** But my own wife, right?

**00:07:40** I need more.

**00:07:41** But like, Mike, the fact that you wouldn't find this funny to me says you haven't really

**00:07:47** like in your soul, internalized.

**00:07:51** Nobody cares, right?

**00:07:52** And guess what?

**00:07:53** If you spend 20 seconds filming a thing in a store while you're shopping for towels and

**00:07:59** then you go post it on the internet, that could literally be the best thing that you've

**00:08:03** ever done.

**00:08:04** And if you spend years of your life tracking down information about an abandoned military

**00:08:10** weapons facility, nobody cares.

**00:08:13** Like it's the number of hours you put in has nothing to do with anything.

**00:08:17** You got to feel it in your soul.

**00:08:19** It's perfectly fine.

**00:08:20** Yeah, sure.

**00:08:23** So anyway, that is also the answer as to why I have to count that as a real video because

**00:08:28** it's my wife's favorite video.

**00:08:29** Oh, now you've made it sweet again.

**00:08:32** See?

**00:08:33** So yes, the snow day counts as my third fastest real video.

**00:08:37** That's the fourth fastest, third fastest, fourth fastest.

**00:08:40** That's the way I'm counting it.

**00:08:41** There were three that were faster.

**00:08:42** How do you feel about speaking French in a video?

**00:08:45** What do you mean?

**00:08:47** Were you like conscious of it?

**00:08:49** Were you concerned you might sound silly?

**00:08:52** Not like trying, you know, because you have a few lines of French in this video.

**00:08:55** Yeah.

**00:08:56** Did you get like, are people going to think I sound stupid?

**00:08:59** No.

**00:09:00** Yo soy parlez-vous français.

**00:09:02** It's very easy, you know?

**00:09:03** No, obviously I don't care at all.

**00:09:05** I just plugged to have fun into Google and press the little button where it says a word

**00:09:10** in French and then I just said it.

**00:09:13** So no, I'm not conscious of it in the slightest.

**00:09:15** I mean, because that's sort of just like a little joke, right?

**00:09:18** Saying the French thing.

**00:09:19** The worst I ever did with languages was it's in one of the Q&A videos.

**00:09:26** I try to speak Dutch for a few sentences.

**00:09:30** Somebody asked about if I speak any other languages to which the answer is no, but I

**00:09:34** thought it would be fun to try to answer in Dutch and ended up going on one of those places

**00:09:41** like Fiverr or something and hiring a few Dutch people to say the sentences in Dutch

**00:09:47** so I could try to repeat it.

**00:09:48** And just you do a few different people because it's a little bit hard if you're just hearing

**00:09:52** one person to understand what the sounds actually are.

**00:09:56** And I spent a long time trying to get it to be phonetically good and I was pretty pleased

**00:10:05** with myself actually.

**00:10:06** I thought like, oh, I think I've done about as good of a job as someone could do trying

**00:10:11** to repeat three sentences in Dutch about how go my mother speaks Dutch, but I don't speak

**00:10:16** Dutch and something else is what I said.

**00:10:19** But the Dutch people disagreed and also my own mother disagreed.

**00:10:26** She sent me a message afterwards of like, oh boy, was that horrible to hear your American

**00:10:33** accent tried to speak Dutch.

**00:10:36** That sounded brutal.

**00:10:38** I think that was more of like a little bit of a letdown.

**00:10:41** I thought, oh, I thought I did really well.

**00:10:42** I just repeated the sounds.

**00:10:44** How hard could it be?

**00:10:46** And as I was out phonetically trying to read lines in another language, you're probably

**00:10:51** not going to be successful even if you think you've done a pretty good job because your

**00:10:56** brain is not picking up on any of the important parts.

**00:11:00** You just don't know where does the emphasis go.

**00:11:03** You can't properly hear the different sounds.

**00:11:06** So the Dutch was a big fail, but the French, I didn't care at all.

**00:11:09** I spent two seconds on Google and repeated it once.

**00:11:13** And I actually kind of thought it would work better for the video.

**00:11:16** If I don't sound very good at French, because that's sort of the meta point that is being

**00:11:20** made.

**00:11:21** Like, nobody learns French in a school, literally nobody.

**00:11:25** I play with the computer.

**00:11:29** It's the only French line that I remember.

**00:11:32** Did you take French in school?

**00:11:33** For a couple of years.

**00:11:34** And then I did the stupid thing and then transitioned to Spanish.

**00:11:37** So I have equal zero knowledge of both languages.

**00:11:41** I maybe did French for three years and then Spanish for three years.

**00:11:45** It's like, that's no good.

**00:11:47** That means you learn negative amounts of languages.

**00:11:49** Yeah.

**00:11:50** Because you start mixing up French and Spanish even more because you didn't learn enough

**00:11:53** of either of them.

**00:11:54** Right.

**00:11:55** That was a terrible idea.

**00:11:56** Why did you switch?

**00:11:57** Because I wanted to go to Spain.

**00:12:00** If you were in French class, your school trip would be to France.

**00:12:03** And if you were in Spanish class, your school trip was Spain.

**00:12:06** Oh, okay.

**00:12:07** And I'd already been to Paris as a kid and I wanted to go to Barcelona instead.

**00:12:11** So I thought, what language?

**00:12:14** And so I went to Barcelona.

**00:12:16** Did you have a good time?

**00:12:17** At least that's a good reason.

**00:12:19** Yeah, I mean, I did.

**00:12:21** I only already have one big memory of that trip.

**00:12:24** I mean, I don't know how old I was, maybe like 15 or whatever.

**00:12:28** But my main memory is we stopped at a service station or whatever.

**00:12:33** So I'm like a big coach.

**00:12:36** That's the other terrible thing is we drove to Spain.

**00:12:38** I don't know why they decided to do that.

**00:12:40** It took 24 hours.

**00:12:41** Why did you do that?

**00:12:42** It was horrible, man.

**00:12:43** I don't know.

**00:12:44** So I guess it was a cost saving thing, but it was terrible.

**00:12:48** I don't know how much money it could have saved.

**00:12:50** Yeah.

**00:12:51** I always see these weird deals like, oh, fly to Spain for 10 pounds.

**00:12:54** And I just like, how could it possibly save that much more money driving?

**00:12:59** It seems like that can't possibly be true.

**00:13:01** All these schools can get like a bulk discount on buying tickets, maybe.

**00:13:05** I mean, I wouldn't be surprised if it's like, it's just easier if you're dealing with 60

**00:13:09** kids to put them on a bus and try and wrangle them through an airport.

**00:13:13** You know what?

**00:13:14** That is the answer.

**00:13:15** You're correct, Mike.

**00:13:16** That is the actual answer.

**00:13:18** The bus, even though they are vastly more likely to die on a bus ride than a plane ride,

**00:13:24** administratively, it is much simpler and you can write up the risk assessment in a

**00:13:29** much easier way if it's on a bus.

**00:13:31** You want controlled environments.

**00:13:33** You don't want uncontrolled environments.

**00:13:34** You're totally right.

**00:13:35** That is incredibly depressing.

**00:13:37** So you were on a bus for bureaucratic reasons.

**00:13:39** We're on a bus, stopped at a service station and everyone went into the service station

**00:13:44** or whatever.

**00:13:45** And, you know, we were buying some snacks or whatever.

**00:13:47** And I was last out of the service station and walked out and the bus wasn't there.

**00:13:53** I can't remember where I was exactly.

**00:13:55** It was somewhere between France and Spain, right?

**00:13:58** Like we're either in France or in Spain at this moment.

**00:14:03** And because we're driving through, right, to go catch the ferry, to go home.

**00:14:07** And I just have this visceral feeling of, well, I'm f***ed, right?

**00:14:14** Because what am I going to do?

**00:14:15** And I don't know why they did this.

**00:14:17** The bus had parked around the corner, so I just turned the corner and I found it.

**00:14:20** And when I got on the bus, everyone started laughing and clapping at me because they knew

**00:14:25** what was going to happen to me when I walked out.

**00:14:27** I don't think they were intentionally playing a prank on me, but it was quickly realized

**00:14:31** that it was the opportunity for one.

**00:14:33** Oh, OK.

**00:14:35** Maybe this was the bus driver's idea of a funny joke that they do this.

**00:14:38** This is how they entertain themselves.

**00:14:40** OK, we'll park around the corner and we'll watch all the kids come out one by one and

**00:14:44** drop their handful of goodies that they purchased.

**00:14:47** Oh, it was just me because I was lost.

**00:14:49** So the people got on the bus and they turned the corner and then stopped to wait for me.

**00:14:54** I think they pranked you, Mike.

**00:14:55** I think that's what happened.

**00:14:56** Well, I would prefer the pranking rather than they left and then one person was like,

**00:15:02** oh, we forgot him.

**00:15:03** You would prefer the pranking to that?

**00:15:05** I prefer the pranking.

**00:15:07** Why?

**00:15:07** Because if they're pranking, then they meant to do it to me.

**00:15:11** If they weren't, the margin of error for me actually getting left behind in a country

**00:15:17** in Europe was way too slim for my liking.

**00:15:20** Right.

**00:15:20** You said you were somewhere between France and Spain and you'd taken both language classes.

**00:15:24** So you would have been fine, right?

**00:15:26** I was fine.

**00:15:27** I was ready.

**00:15:29** Even if we were right at the border and they were speaking some kind of version of the

**00:15:32** two of them, then I would have been completely sad.

**00:15:35** Right.

**00:15:35** They left you in Andorra.

**00:15:36** Yo soy Michael.

**00:15:41** Bebo and Londrez.

**00:15:44** Okay.

**00:15:44** I still don't understand how you prefer all of your classmates actively pranking you to

**00:15:48** just forgetting you.

**00:15:49** That seems like obviously the wrong decision, but...

**00:15:51** No, I'm fine with it.

**00:15:52** Okay.

**00:15:52** The pranking is fine to me because the pranking is still like they just

**00:15:56** we're all having fun or whatever, you know, like at least they have me in their minds.

**00:16:00** If they just started to drive away, there was a point where everyone had forgotten about me.

**00:16:04** Okay.

**00:16:04** I see.

**00:16:04** Now you have hit upon the difference, which is that my target goal in school was constantly

**00:16:11** to have everyone forget about me.

**00:16:13** Just be like this invisible wraith.

**00:16:15** And so being left behind would feel like, aha, I'm doing it right.

**00:16:20** Don't put he's paying any attention and I can just do whatever I want.

**00:16:23** I'm going to live in Andorra now.

**00:16:26** This is at the stage of my school life that we spoke about recently where

**00:16:30** I started to make more friends and cared less about school.

**00:16:33** Ah, okay.

**00:16:34** Itself.

**00:16:35** So it's kind of like in that area.

**00:16:37** So pranking, I guess was the thing in that part of my life.

**00:16:40** And at least that way, you know, I was trying to have friends then rather than focus on schoolwork.

**00:16:45** Again, why I also decided to not be good at any language class and be half good at two.

**00:16:53** Well, again, I'll just gently suggest that even had you stuck with French for all six years,

**00:17:00** your conversational abilities would be not fluent.

**00:17:04** Shall we say that's what that would be my expectation.

**00:17:07** So don't imagine the counterfactual world where you would have learned how to speak French.

**00:17:13** If you had stated those lessons, I always feel bad.

**00:17:16** Like I know I always just harp on the language lessons as totally pointless, but I just,

**00:17:21** I can never not poke it because it just feels to me like the like such a crystal clear perfect case

**00:17:28** of school does not do what it says it does.

**00:17:32** It's like language is just no one can disagree with what happens in language classes.

**00:17:37** It is the easy one for that argument that you make.

**00:17:39** Yeah.

**00:17:39** Because nobody remembers that stuff.

**00:17:42** Yeah.

**00:17:43** You could make more of an argument for like how much Shakespeare do you remember?

**00:17:47** How much biology do you remember?

**00:17:49** I think people are more, can more easily recall those things.

**00:17:53** The languages that they took less so if they didn't continue it in any meaningful way after school.

**00:18:00** Just be slightly carefully.

**00:18:01** The reason why the language is like, oh, wow, look at this really fat fish in this tiny barrel.

**00:18:08** Like it's so easy to shoot is because with a lot of school, how to put it nicely,

**00:18:16** you are learning about a thing and it's way easy to one, fake that knowledge and it's way easy to

**00:18:30** fool yourself into thinking you understand a thing better when the domain of knowledge is

**00:18:38** learn about history.

**00:18:41** Whereas with language classes, there isn't a version of this where you just

**00:18:46** learn about French culture, but never ever learn any of the words.

**00:18:51** That's what a lot of classes actually are.

**00:18:54** Like you're learning about a thing, but language classes pretend to teach you an actual skill

**00:19:01** of we are teaching you how to speak French.

**00:19:05** I guess what I'm trying to say here is with most classes,

**00:19:08** there is not a clear and easy objective way to demonstrate that you have completely failed to

**00:19:14** achieve what you're trying to achieve.

**00:19:17** And with languages, it's like, oh, no, we could very easily demonstrate that you have

**00:19:22** completely failed what you were trying to achieve.

**00:19:24** Six years of French in school produces people who can't speak as well as toddlers.

**00:19:29** Like that's the level that we're talking about here.

**00:19:31** So that that's why it's a very easy target.

**00:19:34** And most of academia doesn't allow itself to be such an easy target, which I think

**00:19:41** ends up having people give them way more benefit of the doubt than they deserve.

**00:20:03** So that's why I'm trying to demonstrate that.

**00:20:05** So I'm trying to demonstrate that.

**00:20:07** So I'm trying to demonstrate that.

**00:21:36** I want to touch on note taking apps.

**00:21:37** I want to do a little check-in.

**00:21:39** I've had a good experience with an app recently.

**00:21:42** Oh yeah.

**00:21:42** And I just wanted to follow up on that a bit, which is craft.

**00:21:46** I think I spoke about craft before.

**00:21:48** You mentioned this one in passing a long time ago.

**00:21:51** Yeah.

**00:21:51** Yeah.

**00:21:52** I think the best way for me to describe craft is imagine in your mind how good you thought ever

**00:21:58** note could be.

**00:21:59** I thought it could be so good.

**00:22:01** And that's what craft is.

**00:22:03** That's what craft is right now.

**00:22:05** There's an excellent application for all kinds of notes and mixed media type stuff.

**00:22:11** And it has some collaboration tools and all that kind of fun stuff, folders and blah, blah, blah.

**00:22:17** I really, really like it.

**00:22:18** I have been using it exclusively for everything related to Cortex brand.

**00:22:23** Okay.

**00:22:23** So all of my text notes and imagery and links and inspiration and all that kind of stuff

**00:22:29** all goes in there, which I mentioned before.

**00:22:31** Like I wanted to separate all that stuff out from my like notes app and I didn't want to

**00:22:36** get it all mixed up with other stuff that I was doing.

**00:22:38** So I've been using craft for that.

**00:22:40** And I've really, really been enjoying using this application.

**00:22:44** There's like a few things that I still want them to add.

**00:22:47** That I believe that they are working on.

**00:22:49** Like one I mentioned, I think in the past was tables.

**00:22:51** They don't have a way to put a table into a note, which is just something that I want

**00:22:56** to have for a few different reasons, but that I know that they're working on that.

**00:23:00** I really liked the way that the app works.

**00:23:03** It, everything's happening like natively.

**00:23:05** It's not doing the, like the banana stuff that apps like Notion does or whatever, where

**00:23:10** it's like, actually just like a web view inside of the application.

**00:23:13** Like it feels good on every platform.

**00:23:15** On the Mac, it's a catalyst app, but it's by far the best catalyst app that I think

**00:23:20** I've ever used.

**00:23:21** Like I would never have known that it was.

**00:23:24** So I guess the question is, it says it's a first take on collaboration so you can share

**00:23:29** and work on the documents with someone else.

**00:23:30** Yeah.

**00:23:31** Interesting.

**00:23:31** Something that also like that they have in the Roma collaboration, every note can be

**00:23:36** published as a webpage.

**00:23:38** So if you just wanted to share a note with someone, you can do that and you get a link

**00:23:43** and you can share just that link.

**00:23:45** They can't edit it.

**00:23:47** Although I think that that is something that they're working on as another thing you

**00:23:50** could possibly do in the future.

**00:23:52** But like I've done this where I've wanted to share feedback with someone.

**00:23:55** I've just collected it all in craft, created a web link to it and just sent them the web

**00:24:00** link and then it can see all of the stuff.

**00:24:03** Yeah, it looks, it looks very nice.

**00:24:05** It definitely has much more user friendly feel than other note taking apps might have.

**00:24:12** I was just curious about the collaboration part because I don't know how to put this.

**00:24:15** Like the one thing that I feel like I still don't have a good solution to is it's how

**00:24:20** to merge at some point my own notes, you know, in a thousand quotation marks, my own notes

**00:24:28** on a topic with the fact checking of a topic that's done later in this post-T-Coi world.

**00:24:36** But I think maybe it's just because there is not a good solution to this and I'm just,

**00:24:40** these are two different sorts of things, but I'm just wondering for a second, like, oh,

**00:24:43** maybe this is the solution because all the fact checking stuff is done in Notion and I just

**00:24:49** hate Notion.

**00:24:50** Notion is very good for the team communication and the library of how does the company work.

**00:25:00** Like Notion is a great tool for that.

**00:25:02** I just, it makes me sad to ever have it open.

**00:25:06** If I am trying to work creatively on a script, it just, it's, you know, it feels very much like,

**00:25:12** oh, this is the database of all of my horrible tax information and all the administrative stuff.

**00:25:20** I'm not exactly sure how you're using Notion, but I reckon a lot of it could be done in

**00:25:25** craft instead.

**00:25:26** I know that your assistant has become a lot more successful.

**00:25:29** In craft instead.

**00:25:30** I know that your assistant has become a big Notion nation person.

**00:25:33** So maybe it would be impossible to move them.

**00:25:35** Yeah, no, I have absolutely no intention of ever moving away from Notion.

**00:25:39** I genuinely think it is really good at the purpose that it's built for, which is being

**00:25:44** this kind of connected database.

**00:25:45** I've just kind of, it's been on my mind, is there a way to have collaboration on, say,

**00:25:53** just the notes on an active video?

**00:25:57** Not like, not everything, but like, here's the two active projects, and here's a way

**00:26:03** that my notes can be visible to other people working on that project with me.

**00:26:09** I think Crofts could do that for you.

**00:26:10** Yeah, maybe.

**00:26:12** It seems like it might be possible.

**00:26:13** I was kind of thinking there's a way to split your databases in Obsidian, and I thought, oh,

**00:26:21** maybe I could do it this way, where there's, I have one database in iCloud, which is my personal

**00:26:26** database and another database in a shared Dropbox folder, which could work to be like, oh, this is

**00:26:32** just the active videos, and then everyone can see what's going on there.

**00:26:36** That doesn't sound dangerous, so.

**00:26:39** I don't understand what you mean, Mike.

**00:26:42** Look, what could possibly go wrong with trying to split a database of all of your knowledge about

**00:26:48** everything into two parts?

**00:26:49** I don't see what could go wrong with that.

**00:26:52** I'll take a look at craft based on your suggestion.

**00:26:54** I've been using it for collecting ideas, like in note form for new projects, mixing it up with links

**00:27:01** and stuff like that.

**00:27:03** There's all nice formatting options.

**00:27:05** So we've been working on a new website.

**00:27:07** I guess we could tell people about the website.

**00:27:09** Oh, can we tell people about the website?

**00:27:10** Well, I mean, it's available.

**00:27:11** It's like on the web now.

**00:27:13** I think the project's done.

**00:27:15** So we've been working on a new theme system website.

**00:27:18** It's now theme system.com.

**00:27:19** And it's beautiful.

**00:27:21** Yeah.

**00:27:21** So we've been working with a really great web designer and it's been a project we've

**00:27:25** gone on for a while.

**00:27:26** It required quite a lot of things, really, like copywriting and working on illustrations.

**00:27:32** And I had to come up with a bunch of example pages that we could put of the way that the

**00:27:36** journal works on the page.

**00:27:38** This is pure like, you know, I'm working in craft and slack, right?

**00:27:41** Like that's how all this stuff's being done.

**00:27:43** It was like just a good example of like a collaborative project for me of getting all the

**00:27:48** copy in place, putting it all in there and then taking the images and annotating the

**00:27:52** images, keeping them all in craft.

**00:27:54** So I've got like a record of how it was building over time.

**00:27:57** Yeah, I'm really, really pleased with the new website.

**00:27:59** It's like the first step towards like a next phase of what we wanted to do with the journal

**00:28:05** product, which is eventually we want to start trying to get customers that don't listen to

**00:28:11** the show.

**00:28:11** Like that's the ultimate goal for this product is right.

**00:28:14** Court accents know how great the theme system is, but we want to tell people about it that

**00:28:19** don't already listen to the show, don't have the background.

**00:28:23** So the website is serving multiple purposes now.

**00:28:27** One of like a instruction manual, effectively, of how to use the journal, but also as a marketing

**00:28:33** tool.

**00:28:34** And previously, the one that I just built on my own, it wasn't a good marketing tool at all.

**00:28:39** It was kind of just like, here's how to do it.

**00:28:42** And so I needed a bit of help in condensing that and also making it really cool visually.

**00:28:50** So working with a wonderful web designer, David, on this, I think we've made something really nice.

**00:28:55** And this is like, so next is like, okay, now we have that.

**00:28:59** How do we start marketing and advertising for the product?

**00:29:02** Like that's the next thing, which I'm really intrigued about how that's going to go.

**00:29:07** Like I feel like I have no great sense of what that's going to be like.

**00:29:15** I've never done anything like this before.

**00:29:16** Yeah.

**00:29:17** I mean, I have absolutely no thoughts on this because the things that we've discussed,

**00:29:21** like Instagram ads, I'm just totally unfamiliar with that world.

**00:29:26** But on the long journey of Cortex brand, like one of the things that we talked about at the beginning,

**00:29:32** and I'm not sure how much we've mentioned in the past years, but it has always been an

**00:29:36** important thing that ultimately these should be products that people who don't know anything about

**00:29:42** us can find and use. And this feels like, wow, we're finally at the first step of being able

**00:29:51** to actually achieve that with having this brand new website. You know, the barrier isn't, oh,

**00:29:57** go listen to this two hour podcast where two people you don't know about talk about their

**00:30:02** themes, which you've also never heard about before.

**00:30:04** Yeah.

**00:30:05** The barrier is look at this website and does this idea seem intriguing to you? And that's why

**00:30:12** like the design process for this, I have loved every update that's come in because I just think

**00:30:17** it's really beautiful. And in designing something like this, I think it's important when you're

**00:30:22** thinking about how to get people's attention. The thing that's nice about the Cortex stuff is,

**00:30:28** okay, these are things that we would use. And so I can look at this webpage and go, oh, wow,

**00:30:34** I know younger me would totally be caught by this and be very interested. Like, oh,

**00:30:41** what is this journal? What is this system? You know, so it's just been very interesting to

**00:30:47** measure the design against my own internal response. And we'll see how advertising goes

**00:30:54** and if that's effective. But I feel like if we can find people like ourselves through advertising,

**00:31:01** I would be shocked if it didn't work because I can feel the pull of this on me as well.

**00:31:07** Yeah, I feel like we can, right? Because so the main place that I'm expecting we will begin

**00:31:14** is Instagram because Instagram's advertising is very effective. It's a very effective on me,

**00:31:20** but I also know we can find people because I get advertised different journal products all the time.

**00:31:24** So like I write something about Instagram, like in their advertising tools, they can find people

**00:31:30** like me, I suppose. And so like, that's who we would be looking for people like me and you.

**00:31:35** And it must be true because these, the journal products have already found me. So there must

**00:31:40** be a way to get this in front of those people that are interested in that kind of product.

**00:31:43** Well, my understanding is that Facebook who runs the ads, they explicitly have a tool which is

**00:31:48** called like lookalike. What is that? I could be wrong because again, I don't have any firsthand

**00:31:53** contact with this. But my understanding from talking to some people who do do this advertising

**00:31:58** is that there is a Facebook tool called lookalike. Wow. Yeah. A lookalike audience is a group

**00:32:03** who are determined as sharing characteristics of another group. Yeah. So you can basically say,

**00:32:08** here's me and here's a couple of people that I think are like me. Find the lookalikes for

**00:32:14** this group of people. Like, and whatever that means to Facebook. That seems like a very easy

**00:32:19** way to get started. Since Facebook looks directly into your soul by tracking you everywhere.

**00:32:26** I suspect that that might be a place to start to be like, okay, here's the, I don't even know. Do

**00:32:34** we have a cortex Facebook page? I don't think we do, but we don't. We could figure out like,

**00:32:38** who's a group of people that are like cortex people then find a lookalike audience to try

**00:32:44** to advertise the existence of this notebook too. I mean, I am going to look into it more anyway,

**00:32:50** but this is now a great place to start. Yeah. I mean, all of this, I just, I don't know. I feel

**00:32:55** like I just keep needing to reemphasize this because I sometimes run across sometimes when

**00:33:00** people talk to me about their product ideas. It is very important that you make a product that you

**00:33:07** would want to use. And this sounds like the dumbest advice in the world, but I definitely come across

**00:33:13** people who are trying to make products for other people who aren't them as like, no,

**00:33:20** that's so much harder and it's so much harder on every possible level. And this right here,

**00:33:26** I feel like is another great example of why do you want to make a product that you yourself would use?

**00:33:31** Because it's easy to make it in ways that you know is good. And then it's also way easier to

**00:33:38** try to figure out where are people like me going to be to find out about this product or how do

**00:33:44** I respond to this ad, not how does this theoretical audience that isn't like me,

**00:33:51** how will they respond to this ad? And then you have to do like testing because you don't

**00:33:56** know for anybody who's working on their side products, make sure, especially if it's your

**00:34:01** first one, that it's a thing that you would use. I think it just makes it so much easier.

**00:34:07** Yeah. I will say there was a funny part, which is somewhat akin to it, but also not like I

**00:34:14** know that I needed someone that wasn't me to help me put this website together because I'm far too

**00:34:20** close to the system, right? Yeah. I'm too close to it. So like I needed someone outside of me and you

**00:34:28** to help with the with like explaining this to other people. Everything I was doing was just like,

**00:34:33** I was just, it was too much information constantly. It needed a fresh set of eyes to help me kind of

**00:34:40** put together better explanations of how all this stuff is meant to be used. But in the same vein,

**00:34:47** I could then look at that website and knew where it was working or where it wasn't. You know what

**00:34:52** I mean? Like it kind of needed to go through someone else, but then I could see like, Oh,

**00:34:57** no, that's not explaining it. Or I don't get that because I know completely what the product is about,

**00:35:03** but it definitely needed an outside set of eyes for me to be able to condense it down to what we have

**00:35:08** now. Yeah. That's what I mean by the you can judge it thing. I would not have been able to write

**00:35:14** copy as simply as the copy that is written on that site, but I can read it and know, ah, this would

**00:35:22** catch my attention. But yeah, cause I would have the same problem that you would have of like,

**00:35:26** how do I, how do you describe like, it was just too much. We've been talking about it for years.

**00:35:31** It's useful to see what someone else thinks are the key points. It's a really exciting first step.

**00:35:36** And I wasn't, I didn't quite realize until just now that, Oh, it's, it's actually live on the

**00:35:40** internet. It's, it's not hidden now behind a password somewhere. So it's up. People can go

**00:35:44** look at it and tell us what they think about it. Themesystem.com. Themesystem.com.

**00:35:50** How is the Obsidian beta for iOS serving you? I just had this very long conversation with Federico

**00:35:59** on connected one of my other shows about it. He's effectively building his very own writing app

**00:36:03** inside of Obsidian. Oh, he's getting into Obsidian. Yeah. Oh, big time. And he's found a

**00:36:08** way to like embed todoist inside of Obsidian. Yeah. Cause it's just web views. Like you can

**00:36:13** do any kind of web view stuff because of the plugin architecture of Obsidian. He's really

**00:36:18** doing some just like very Federico wild things. Like he's created this little thing where he can

**00:36:24** put a open bracket and closed bracket and then a line of text and that's a to do. And he has a

**00:36:31** plugin that runs like through that document and pulls all of those out and turns them into tasks

**00:36:36** in todoist. So he's doing all kinds of stuff right now. Cause he's building up, like he's getting

**00:36:42** ready for his iOS review, right? Cause that process starts, I guess in like a month for him. Oh,

**00:36:48** right. Right. So he's like setting on Obsidian as maybe his app for right now. Well, I mean,

**00:36:53** it's a new year. He needs a new app to write his review, right? Isn't this what happens every year?

**00:36:58** Is that he goes to something different? He said on the show, like last year he didn't.

**00:37:02** And so he feels like he has to now cause like last year was the first time where he hadn't changed

**00:37:07** that. Oh, wow. So like now you get to change it a little bit. I know imagine that, but how are you

**00:37:12** getting on with it? I'm really liking it. I think the beta is, I mean, I'll just say way better than

**00:37:19** I would have any reasonable expectation of a beta being at this point in time. I'm still running

**00:37:25** into some minor bugs because I use emoji file names. Again, this is 100% my own dumb fault. And

**00:37:31** I've sent them in sometimes on the test flight. But aside from that, it's very smooth. It's very

**00:37:37** solid. And I'm really happy to have it on the iPad as an option. And this sort of lines up with what

**00:37:43** it sounds like Federico is doing. It only dawned on me in the past couple of weeks that one of the

**00:37:50** reasons that I really like obsidian is it feels like going home again to, uh, what's called org

**00:37:59** mode on emacs, which is like, I don't even know how, like where to begin trying to describe what that

**00:38:05** means. Talk about obsidian. You find a new way to convince me never to go there. You're like,

**00:38:13** Federico tells me this stuff. I'm like, Oh, that sounds interesting. And then you're like,

**00:38:17** it reminds me of emacs. And I'm like, yeah, I'm good. Yeah. I mean, it's, this is one of those

**00:38:23** things. Like there will be 100% comments this time about org mode and emacs because people who use it

**00:38:29** love it. But emacs is like obsidian times a hundred. I mean, I don't know. Emacs is a Linux

**00:38:38** text editor. It's gotta be, I don't know, 40 years old at this point in the way that some,

**00:38:43** you know, open source Linux stuff is, but the joke with emacs is, Oh, it's not a text editor.

**00:38:48** It's an operating system all unto itself, which it totally was like you could do literally anything

**00:38:54** you can conceive of with texts in emacs. And then I think it's just a one person project,

**00:39:00** but there's a plugin for emacs called org mode, which is an entirely text-based to do system.

**00:39:10** And when I found this in college, like this was how before I had a real system

**00:39:16** got through writing papers and stuff, because the bottom line was it allowed you to really easily

**00:39:23** kind of mix and match. Oh, I'm working on a document, but also I can just throw in a to-do

**00:39:30** item right here and then just keep writing. And later in this system, I can have it just show me,

**00:39:36** Oh, here are all the to-dos that happened to be scattered randomly through all of your text

**00:39:41** documents. You don't care about where exactly those to-dos are right now, because you're just

**00:39:45** trying to get a high level overview of it. And it also had a lot of the features of the kind of

**00:39:49** outlining and little, little bits of texts and stuff. Anyway, it just crossed my mind like,

**00:39:54** Oh, that's what this is. Obsidian is a modern iOS and Mac version of emacs and org mode. And this

**00:40:04** is why I feel really at home with this program. And it's also why you should not use it, Mike.

**00:40:10** This is not the tool for you. But part of why I imagine Federico is using it and like, I haven't

**00:40:16** delved into this too much, but it is. I only just realized, Oh, even in the beta,

**00:40:22** they're already allowing their whole plugin architecture to work. And then that does make

**00:40:26** it basically infinitely customizable for anything that you want to do. So it's like, Oh, wow. Like,

**00:40:32** this is way more powerful iOS than I had originally thought. So yeah, I'm still loving

**00:40:37** it. It's going really well. Very solid for the test flight. Maybe I'll force my assistants and

**00:40:44** fact checker to use it a little bit with some of my notes when I split my database. You know,

**00:40:48** we'll see. Maybe that'll happen. Maybe that won't, but I recommend Obsidian very highly to everyone

**00:40:54** who isn't Mike. This episode of Cortex is brought to you by Fitbot, the fitness app that provides a

**00:41:00** personalized exercise plan, a fitness plan that actually fits you. When it comes to fitness,

**00:41:05** Fitbot believes that everyone can be better. Whether you're working out three days a week

**00:41:09** or twice a day, Fitbot's algorithm uses data and analytics to help you build on your previous

**00:41:14** workout so that your next workout is scientifically proven to be better than your last. Fitbot has

**00:41:19** been fine-tuned by certified personal trainers to bring you the very best practices of strength

**00:41:24** training directly to you. You have a workout program that is tailored exactly to suit your needs,

**00:41:29** making it perfect for your unique body experience, environment, and goals.

**00:41:33** Fitbot figures everything out for you so you don't have to worry about under or over training.

**00:41:38** Trying to work out exactly how much you should be doing can be quite daunting,

**00:41:41** so Fitbot takes care of it and will also mix up muscle groups and exercises,

**00:41:45** sets, reps, and weight as well over time to keep you on top form while making sure that you stay

**00:41:51** on a path that's right for you to help you take steps towards becoming a better version of yourself.

**00:41:56** Fitbot has a bunch of body weight only workouts if you're at home right now. These are great for

**00:42:01** indoors or outdoors, especially if you have no equipment, but if you do have access to a gym or

**00:42:05** some equipment, they have tons of great workout options there for you. It doesn't matter what you

**00:42:09** have, they've got what you're going to need. Fitbot is there to help you with any exercise routine.

**00:42:14** I really appreciate how Fitbot does the mixing up of muscle groups. It means that I'm not going to

**00:42:19** be causing pain to myself multiple days in a row. I really like as well that every time you do a

**00:42:24** workout, it can show you what parts of your body were worked out by that. So I guess you can match

**00:42:29** it up with how your body's feeling at that time. Something that I just truly value about the app

**00:42:34** is the little videos that they put with every exercise to make sure that you're doing things

**00:42:38** correctly. I always want to know. I can read the instructions to get an idea, but having the videos

**00:42:42** too, it really just helps crystallize it for me. Fitbot is available on iOS and Android and you

**00:42:47** can get started right now by going to fitbot.me slash cortex. If you do, you'll also get 25% of

**00:42:53** your membership. That's fitbot.me slash cortex to try it out for free and get 25% off your Fitbot

**00:43:00** membership. A thanks to Fitbot for their support of Cortex and Relay FM. It is that time again,

**00:43:06** but that time again is earlier. It's that time of year, but it's not. It's the time of year,

**00:43:13** but that time of year has changed. So for the last few years in August, we do a bonus episode

**00:43:19** for Relay FM members, where we have played text adventures with Jason Snell of the upgrade

**00:43:25** podcast crossover. And we are teaming up with Jason again, but with a bit of a twist this time.

**00:43:31** And we're doing them earlier in the year because of stuff like the podcastathon for St. Jude every

**00:43:36** year, which happens in September. We needed to start splitting these things apart. We used to

**00:43:41** do these in August every year. And really those two big projects were starting to collide with each

**00:43:46** other. So we are from now going to be doing our annual member specials in kind of May, June time.

**00:43:52** So it gives us space in the summer. Can I just interject here and say, I am so glad that you

**00:43:56** did this. Like watching you go through, oh, it's podcastathon. Oh, it's also WWDC. Oh,

**00:44:03** it's also all of the membership specials for all of my shows within a short month period. It was

**00:44:11** brutal. So I'm so glad that that that that you moved this. And yes, we recorded this

**00:44:16** a while ago now. And I was I was so happy to be like, oh, thank God we're getting this off Mike's

**00:44:20** plate. Yeah, it was much better. This time we have a bit of a twist. So we're not doing a text

**00:44:25** adventure this time for a couple of reasons. The main one is that Jason felt like we had outgrown

**00:44:31** text adventures because we have a text adventure in the way that you're supposed to play them.

**00:44:37** The text adventure parser, which was Jason would say, hey, you can go left or right. And then me

**00:44:43** and you would want to explore the space and just like rip the pictures off the walls. And this is

**00:44:47** that stuff that it not in the text adventure. So every year, Jason's having to basically augment

**00:44:52** the text adventure to deal with us kind of wanting to rip up the floorboards and see what was around.

**00:44:59** This style of play is actually better suited to a more RPG adventure. You know, like people will

**00:45:05** have heard of Dungeons and Dragons. That is a form of a role playing game. And so this year we

**00:45:10** are playing a role playing game adventure instead. So we have way more flexibility within the world

**00:45:17** to do whatever we want, rather than the limited options that attacks adventure will provide for

**00:45:22** us. Now, I always wanted these to be RPGs, but figured it was too hard of a sell on grace. We

**00:45:27** started with text adventure and then have now gotten to the RPG that I always wanted. We're

**00:45:32** also changing how we're playing in that this year, Jason is joining our team as the people

**00:45:38** playing the game. And we have brought in an experienced game master slash dungeon master

**00:45:44** that are called game masters. We're not playing Dungeons and Dragons. It's a different RPG.

**00:45:48** I was like, why aren't you calling him a dungeon master? He's the dungeon master.

**00:45:51** They said it's a dungeon master. If we were in dungeons, we were not in a dungeon.

**00:45:55** No, it's always a dungeon master unless Dungeons and Dragons has trademarked that.

**00:45:59** So it is game master outside the Dungeons and Dragons. So our friend Tony Senderlagh,

**00:46:04** he is the dungeon master on the Total Party Kill podcast, which is a Dungeons and Dragons podcast,

**00:46:10** but we are not playing Dungeons and Dragons. So it's an RPG adventure. This is going to be

**00:46:15** available on May 21st for relay FM members in our crossover feed that we have. So this is where you

**00:46:23** also get all of the annual bonus specials from this year and past years from this show and other

**00:46:28** shows in the network. When you are a member, it's in the podcast section of your member for

**00:46:33** page once you've logged in. But I'll also put a link in the show notes of this episode that you

**00:46:37** just tap it. You sign in with your credentials and you're good to go. If you're a new member,

**00:46:42** you'll find it when you sign up as well. By the way, if you go to getmoretext.com,

**00:46:46** you will get this and also more text. Now that's the real winner right there. So not only will you

**00:46:51** get the RPG special episode, you also get access to the more text feed, which has longer episodes

**00:46:57** of cortex every single month with no ads. If you've been wondering, maybe I should try more text.

**00:47:02** They're always talking about it. It seems like fun. This is the perfect time to try it. You can sign

**00:47:06** up. You will get our membership special. You also get access to the more text feed and you can go

**00:47:11** and listen to previous episodes of more text, see what the kind of content is as well as getting the

**00:47:16** special. And if you say subscribed, you will get more text forever. If you don't want it, that's

**00:47:20** fine. You won't get more text anymore. We changed that. Just so you know, people would sign up once

**00:47:25** and subscribe forever. Not anymore. If you stop paying, you stop getting the extras, right? That's

**00:47:31** a change for our new system. But I really enjoyed this special. It's very different, but I had such

**00:47:38** a good time with it. It's also, I think way longer than any that we've done before. It's two and a

**00:47:43** half hours long. Yeah. I think is the final runtime of the special. Like you said, the world of the RPG

**00:47:49** is functionally infinite in every direction as opposed to the text game where it's like,

**00:47:55** it's a small constrained environment. So yeah, when we were recording on the night too, I think

**00:47:59** we were recording for like three hours. It was forever long. It was over there. It was like three

**00:48:04** and a half hours was the recording and the edited episode is down to about two and a half. Yeah.

**00:48:09** It's a big, big members episode. So you can't say no to getmoretext.com right now. Exactly. Imagine

**00:48:16** all of this incredible content available to you at getmoretext.com. All of this content and literally

**00:48:21** more text. Why have we never thought of that before? I don't know. I don't know why. All of

**00:48:27** this content and more text. Oh man, I love it. There you go. It's a new tagline. This is, this

**00:48:32** is how the magic happens. That's how we end the show, Mike. That's how we ended every time now,

**00:48:35** as we go all of this and more. So at the beginning we say hello and welcome to Cortex. Right. And

**00:48:40** then at the end we say you can get all of this and more text at getmoretext.com. That's very good.

**00:48:45** That's how that works. It's kind of funny. Like with our last episode, we were talking about how

**00:48:49** we edit this show, right? And with this project being so much larger than stuff we've done in the

**00:48:54** past, I actually ended up getting some outside editing help for this project. It was one of those

**00:49:01** things where we did it and then we had done another episode of our show and I was editing that.

**00:49:07** And then we were getting ready for this episode and then realized, oh, I have to do the member

**00:49:13** bonus special in between these two periods of time. Right. And I knew how long it was and I

**00:49:20** knew it was going to be more work than normal. And I had not accurately budgeted my time. Yeah.

**00:49:26** And we're also recording Cortex's closer together. Everything was going against you in this scenario.

**00:49:31** You know, we usually was like three or four weeks in between. We had like two weeks in between.

**00:49:36** And so I was like, oh man, this is, this is bad. So I, very talented editing friend of mine, Brian,

**00:49:42** I got him to come in and he did like a first pass. And what he was doing was just cleaning it up.

**00:49:48** So all I had to go in and do afterwards is add in the sound clips that I wanted,

**00:49:54** remove things that didn't work. Like he didn't do a content pass. He did like a,

**00:49:58** I'm going to clean up some um's and are's and tighten the whole thing up. It was kind of funny

**00:50:03** to me. I almost couldn't believe it that he, he got an hour out of the audio, which I don't,

**00:50:07** I don't know how that's possible. Like I've never really paid attention to how much of a run time

**00:50:13** I cut down from the, what we have recorded and what ends up being the final episode. But for this

**00:50:20** specifically, there was a lot of thinking time and stuff. Like Tony would give us something to do

**00:50:26** and we'd have to try and work out what we wanted to do with it. So there's like a lot of gaps that

**00:50:31** I guess you could cut out, but I'm so pleased. I mean, it took Brian 14 hours to do his part.

**00:50:39** And then mine, well, let me try and count it up real quick.

**00:50:43** Let's just say you didn't have a spare 14 hours in this fortnight to put into the members episode,

**00:50:50** right? That was, that was time that was just not possible for you to find. So it's, it's fantastic.

**00:50:55** He was able to do it. I mean, it took me about the same, right? Okay. So you didn't have 30 hours.

**00:51:01** And also it was just much more pleasant for me to be doing the part that I truly enjoy,

**00:51:08** which is adding in the sound clips and building the sound space of the member special. That's the

**00:51:14** thing I really enjoy about these is, is taking what is just our conversation, our like conversational

**00:51:21** audio. And I mean, this sounds so terrible, but I have no other way of saying it, like creating a

**00:51:27** world out of it, like actually creating an atmosphere. Yeah. That doesn't sound terrible.

**00:51:30** At all. That's literally what you're doing. And again, I always think of the old, I've mentioned

**00:51:35** before, but like the radio plays that I used to listen to as a kid, a big part of that is when

**00:51:40** it's not an audio book, when it is, oh, this is an environment that these people are moving through.

**00:51:46** It really matters to have that fully work in the background. It really changes the listening

**00:51:52** experience. And when I listen to it, I'm always really impressed by how much effort you do in

**00:51:58** creating. It's like you're vivifying the experience with the sound effects. And I also

**00:52:06** know that this was a particularly big project and was also because now there's four people,

**00:52:10** it's also more complicated. I enjoyed how you let me know very directly and very clearly that I was

**00:52:17** not going to be able to look at the logic project for this one. In the past, in the past, I have

**00:52:24** listened to the logic project, but you were very gray. You are not allowed to touch this.

**00:52:29** So I actually had to do the thing we discussed last time of, oh, if I had notes, I could just

**00:52:34** text them to you, but I couldn't. Yeah. That was as much as you were doing.

**00:52:38** I'm going to open the logic project and I'm going to tell you the cuts, right? Oh God.

**00:52:43** So like a typical episode of Cortex is, what did we say? It says like 1500 cuts. Yeah. 1500.

**00:52:50** Put the image in the show notes last time so people could see what that looked like.

**00:52:55** Where this one takes a little while for the project to open.

**00:53:00** Because it's so small. This has, it's still opening.

**00:53:07** It's beach balling right now. Logic is now beach balling my Mac mini.

**00:53:11** I hope you have a backup recorder going. This is a funny thing where I couldn't edit

**00:53:15** this project on my iMac Pro. I had to edit on my M1 Mac Pro because my iMac Pro could not handle

**00:53:21** it. I was trying to move things around. Like I was trying to move literal thousands of cuts around

**00:53:28** and it could not handle it. I think that is one of the most interesting real world test cases

**00:53:35** for Apple doing something quite interesting and different with those M1s where on flat out

**00:53:41** certain kinds of tasks, different chips can beat those M1 laptops, but on Apple optimized stuff,

**00:53:49** like nothing can. So we've got Logic. It's running on the right operating system. We know exactly

**00:53:54** what the chip is and Apple's really able to squeeze out a ton of, I don't know how to put

**00:54:00** these, but I think of them as very low latency optimizations with that M1 chip. Like I'm just

**00:54:06** very aware of it when I'm working in Final Cut as well, that the difference between my M1 computer

**00:54:11** and my iMac Pro is the iMac Pro still wins on export speed, but just actually working in Final

**00:54:18** Cut. It's surprising how fast and instant everything is. Yeah. Like the iMac Pro is faster

**00:54:23** exporting these projects and my Mac Pro, but my Mac Pro can handle zooming around and moving

**00:54:29** stuff around like better than any machine that I've ever used before. And I think it is because

**00:54:34** we are using the tools that Apple makes for its platforms. They have teams of people

**00:54:39** where their jobs are to make sure they are refining the experience of these applications

**00:54:45** on these machines directly. So one of the issues that I was having about Openness Project is I use

**00:54:51** Dropbox's like feature where some things are not saved to the computer. This stuff wasn't downloaded

**00:54:57** on this machine. So I am currently now downloading the Logic project so I can give you the answer of

**00:55:02** that. I have to do that because I mean, honestly, partly the reason I have to do that is because of

**00:55:08** our show, we save everything. Every episode of Cortex is saved in Dropbox, which I always thought

**00:55:14** was a silly thing to do until Moretex came around. Yeah, that's why I told you like don't get rid of

**00:55:19** those shows. You were right. You were right. It was I was so pleased we did it because when it

**00:55:24** came to remastering the audio files and pulling out the ads and stuff, I had all the original

**00:55:28** Logic projects. That was how I was able to encode the old episodes in the Moretex feed

**00:55:34** a higher bitrate. They sound better because I now just since have just started doing that,

**00:55:39** like I encode audio at a higher bitrate than we used to. So the Moretex episodes are actually what

**00:55:46** I refer to them as remastered. And there's some slight, very, very slight tweaks that I made to

**00:55:51** some of the timing as I was zooming around the files, which was funny to me. I was like, oh,

**00:55:54** I wouldn't accept that now. Now it's fine. So I was very pleased I had it. But because of that,

**00:55:59** all the stuff that I have in Dropbox is larger than any SSD that I have. Right. I have more than

**00:56:07** a terabyte of stuff in Dropbox. So I can't have everything download. So I use Dropbox's system

**00:56:14** where you can have some files saved locally and some files saved in the cloud. Yeah, you can set

**00:56:21** it like so like some folders are just automatically synced. But I had not done that for this one. So

**00:56:26** we're currently still downloading. So I will be able to give you the answer in a minute.

**00:56:29** I'm very familiar with that feature, Mike, because I just quickly double checked. I currently have

**00:56:37** 24.63 terabytes of data in Dropbox. Wow. So I assume you're saving final cut stuff in there,

**00:56:45** right? You must be says video. That's surely video. It is video. A lot of it is video,

**00:56:50** but the raw files to generate the animations are bigger than you might expect that they are,

**00:56:55** even though everything is vector based. They're still quite complicated projects.

**00:56:59** So yes, a lot of that is video, but this is also a side effect of just like with Cortex,

**00:57:05** I keep all of the raw stuff to produce as many of the videos as I can. Some of the much older

**00:57:10** stuff I have lost the original files somewhere along the way, which is a little sad, but yeah,

**00:57:16** my Dropbox is huge. And there's only one machine where I can have it all downloaded. And I have

**00:57:21** one of those giant like Pegasus 50 terabyte drive things to be able to keep it all locally

**00:57:27** in one computer. But yeah, everywhere else when I install Dropbox, it gives me this warning of like,

**00:57:32** you have 20 million files in your thing. You cannot sync all of this. It will not be fast.

**00:57:37** Please select just the things you want on this computer. I'm very glad Dropbox added that feature.

**00:57:43** Do you back that up as well somewhere or is like the backup, the hard drive and the source of files

**00:57:50** is Dropbox. The source of files is Dropbox. It's all locally stored. I do also have a copy of it

**00:57:56** stored in backblaze online. I have like these giant storage things are so expensive. I haven't

**00:58:03** quite pulled the trigger on it, but I have been thinking I probably should get a second local

**00:58:11** physical copy of all of this data. So I think that is on my shopping list at some point to do to have

**00:58:16** a second local physical backup. But currently I have two online backups and the actual physical

**00:58:23** files here. So that's the way it works. Yeah, I have Dropbox and then I have Time Machine

**00:58:29** and then everything's in backblaze somehow. Like I just know that somehow it's there, right? Like

**00:58:34** most of the time I'm not entirely sure how it's there, but I know it's all there, right? Like it

**00:58:39** says it gets complicated with the Dropbox stuff. It does. And again, it's very easy to like lose

**00:58:45** data and things, but I'm very vigilant about how all of the computers in the house have Time Machine

**00:58:50** drives that they connect to and they all are keeping a local copy of whatever the current active

**00:58:57** projects are. So in the house, I've got like six, seven Time Machine drives connected to various

**00:59:03** computers that are always just running so I can make sure that whatever I happen to be working on,

**00:59:07** I always have the local copies. So that stuff is the most important to make sure it's backed up.

**00:59:13** It's a delicate line with computer files of when have you crossed the line into paranoia and when

**00:59:20** do you just have a good system? But I actually do think that for the value of all of those raw

**00:59:25** files, I am probably slightly under backed up from what I should be. I just haven't been willing to

**00:59:31** drop a huge amount of money on another giant local storage system yet, but I should really

**00:59:37** bite the bullet on that. This has been a bit of a funny episode so far where like we're in lots of

**00:59:42** brackets. We keep doing this. I keep thinking the same thing. We're still talking about like the

**00:59:46** membership here, but now somehow we've ended up in online backup as the conversation. So coming

**00:59:51** back out a few steps. It was like, have you opened your logic file yet? It's now downloaded.

**00:59:56** 4,218 is the number of events that we have. That is about two to three times the size of a regular

**01:00:04** Cortex episode. So hence why I won't let Gray or anybody near this logic project because one

**01:00:11** force move and everything's ruined. Now look, Mike, I just want to badly crossfade one section. Why

**01:00:17** won't you let me monkey around? Come on, come on, let me crossfade it. Come on. No, it's not

**01:00:25** happening. So anyway, I think that this special is super fun. I think you're going to love it.

**01:00:29** Go to getmoretex.com. You can sign up right now. Not only will you get more text, you'll also get

**01:00:34** our wonderful special. We will have a trailer at the end of the episode as well. So you'll get an

**01:00:39** idea for what you'll be hearing. getmoretex.com. Let's do some hashtag ask Cortex questions.

**01:00:46** I think I mentioned this on our last episode, but I want to, we're trying to do more of these. I

**01:00:51** actually would like to do Ask Cortex on pretty much every episode now, even if you just do a couple.

**01:00:56** I always enjoy doing it and I feel like we don't do it enough and they kind of just build up.

**01:01:01** I agree. I think we need to touch on it more as a regular segment. It's always fun and you never

**01:01:05** know what people are going to ask. So hashtag ask Cortex. Yeah. So I also just wanted to say in

**01:01:10** the show, if you want to submit a question for a future episode, you can tweet with the hashtag

**01:01:15** ask cortex, or if you are in the Relay FM members discord, which you also get access to by signing

**01:01:20** up at getmoretex.com. You can use question mark, ask cortex anywhere in the discord and it will

**01:01:26** submit to the same place. One spreadsheet of truth that I have to draw from. Nice system you have

**01:01:30** there. I like it a lot. So let's do some, some questions. Great. What do you like the look of

**01:01:35** him? I like this one from Steven there that catches my attention straight away.

**01:01:39** Oh, interesting. I thought I was going to have to twist your arm for this question.

**01:01:42** Oh yeah. Why?

**01:01:43** I don't know. It just feels like, well, let me ask the question and then maybe we'll find out.

**01:01:47** You both make art that is in many elements timeless. How much does the idea of legacy

**01:01:53** factor into the choices that you make? So why do you, why do you just felt like a,

**01:01:57** like a very big topic. I just wasn't sure if you were interested in talking about something like

**01:02:02** this, but I'm pleased that you are. Cause I find, I think about this kind of stuff a lot.

**01:02:06** Okay. So, so tell me what you think about it.

**01:02:09** I mean, what's your legacy, Mike?

**01:02:13** It's difficult to talk about this kind of stuff and not seem egotistical, but I think a lot of

**01:02:19** people like to wonder what their mark on the world is. And I think if you make content for people,

**01:02:28** it only shines more of a spotlight on that because so, you know, stuff that we make is enjoyed by

**01:02:35** people around the world that we've never met and will never meet. And so you have an effect on

**01:02:41** those people. And I often wonder if my effect will outlast me. And if it's going to, have I done

**01:02:53** enough stuff that is good enough to warrant that, that if it does outlast me, that the effect could

**01:03:00** continue. I feel like the type of stuff that I make, there is less of a chance of that than some

**01:03:05** of the content that you make just from like, Hey, what is the content and how consumable is it into

**01:03:11** the future? You know, like the videos that you make by and large have a more of a timelessness

**01:03:18** than most of the stuff that I make. Conversations, even if you're thinking about them being timeless,

**01:03:26** which we both do, even when we're just recording this podcast, conversations are intrinsically

**01:03:33** more linked to a moment in time than many other media. But I think about it. And sometimes I think

**01:03:41** about like what my future as a person who makes things will be. And if I want to consider legacy

**01:03:50** as more of a part of that as well, do I want to have an impact on the world? And what do I want

**01:03:55** that impact to be? You want to lean into the legacy? I don't know if I want to lean into it,

**01:04:03** but I think about it. Hmm. You know, at least I fancy the idea of leaning into it, but I don't

**01:04:11** know if I would ever actually do it. Does that make sense? So like legacy for me, creating

**01:04:16** something which has more legacy to me, I think is easier to do as a creator. If you are creating

**01:04:24** something that is fiction. Yes. Oh yeah. Yeah. I think it's easier to leave a lasting impact in

**01:04:32** something that is not you, like you're creating something that can live on its own without the

**01:04:37** creator ever being questioned or thought about. Right. Then like, you know, you can read a book,

**01:04:42** watch a movie and you enjoy it for what it is. You don't necessarily think about the person

**01:04:47** who came up with the idea. And these are most instances. Do you actually really need to,

**01:04:52** you just enjoy the content for what it is. Hmm. I think it's easier to leave a lasting impact

**01:04:57** if you are a creator, if you're what you create is fiction as a person to leave a lasting impact.

**01:05:05** Otherwise you would do things in politics or in altruism or something like that, right? Like they

**01:05:11** would be your other paths, I think, to live longer lasting impacts. But if I'm thinking about what I

**01:05:17** can do as a creative person, I don't know if the type of stuff that I do right now is enough to

**01:05:24** leave an impact into the future. But of course I would like to write. Okay. I think a lot of people

**01:05:32** given the opportunity like, Hey, do you want to leave a lasting impact on the world? Yeah,

**01:05:36** I would actually, cause that sounds kind of nice. And I have enough of an ego that I think I would

**01:05:41** enjoy that. But I think the things that I assume of like ways that I could, I just don't know if I

**01:05:47** have it in me to make something like that. You know? Hmm. I mean, this is also the problem of if

**01:05:56** you want to try to do something like this, you have to realize the half-life of anything that out

**01:06:03** lasts you is right. So when you say, Oh, leave an impact on the world, but only for so long.

**01:06:11** So he's interesting to play the game of how many people can you name in the current century? Quite

**01:06:16** a lot. The last century, one, 100th as many two centuries ago, one, 10,000th as many, right? Like

**01:06:25** it drops off real fast about how many people are remembered or their works still enjoyed is a

**01:06:33** very sharp drop off. So I think that that's also part of the like, Oh, do you want to leave a

**01:06:38** legacy? But like, what are you thinking is your timeframe here? Because ultimately everyone is

**01:06:44** forgotten. Well, I don't know, man. I have no idea, right? I, maybe half an hour would be fine. Like,

**01:06:53** I really have no idea, right? Like I've never thought about it in those terms. You know, like,

**01:06:58** what have you got like from somebody who made a hit song that lives for 20 years to William

**01:07:04** Shakespeare, right? You've got, you know what I mean? You have like such a huge, I don't know. I've

**01:07:10** never thought about that. Honestly, like I've never thought about what it would be. How long would I

**01:07:14** like to leave a mark on the world? Yeah. But just that like, I mean, honestly, there is even just

**01:07:18** this element of in my lifetime, I'm fine, right? To feel like I've done something that has made

**01:07:26** enough of an impact that people care for as long as I'm alive. Right. So this, this is where I

**01:07:31** actually kind of wanted to direct you because I think this is the better way to think about it.

**01:07:36** Not thinking about legacy, but thinking about impact currently. And I think thinking about

**01:07:44** legacy is a sort of fool's errand that you can't really aim for directly. And also by definition,

**01:07:53** you will never know if you were successful, right? Like it is the ultimate unachievable goal

**01:07:59** because you will never know if you have achieved it. There's no way to learn or try to adjust.

**01:08:07** But if you do make things that impact people now in their current lives, whatever those things

**01:08:14** are, have some kind of chance of outlasting you almost by definition. So I think like,

**01:08:22** don't think about legacy. I feel like that's a really bad way to think about something and it

**01:08:27** puts your brain totally in the wrong way. And instead you should think about, oh, have I done

**01:08:32** things that have an impact on people now that I can see and that I can measure and that I can

**01:08:38** think about and adjust. I think that's a much better way to frame this question.

**01:08:43** What have you, do you think, what do you think about with this stuff? Do you?

**01:08:46** So what I think about for myself is actually going back to the product conversation before.

**01:08:52** I think of a lot of the stuff that I make that are like the videos or the conversations that are

**01:09:00** designed to be more impactful. I am always thinking about a younger version of myself coming

**01:09:07** across that same information. And that is another way where you can kind of know that maybe you have

**01:09:15** an impact on someone. It's a very different information landscape now than say when I was

**01:09:22** in high school praying with all my heart for snow days. Like I just, I very much remember

**01:09:29** having this strong feeling often of, oh, the world is filled with a whole bunch of

**01:09:36** bullshits and nonsensical advice and kind of looking and trying to find information that

**01:09:44** resonated with me or trying to find people who thought like I did. And it was like a long period

**01:09:51** in the wilderness of not being successful with that just because of the technology at the time.

**01:09:58** But there is a way in which I make many of my things as something that I think, oh, that younger

**01:10:04** version of me would have been really happy to find this thing. Even in the sillier videos,

**01:10:09** it's like still trying to hit a certain kind of chord, but then with the ones that are more

**01:10:13** designed directly to try to help people like the videos about happiness or the videos about how

**01:10:19** not to ruin your brain with bad memes or the video about themes. Those are designed to be

**01:10:27** for that sort of person to find and say, oh, I know that this would work for you because this

**01:10:32** is the kind of thing that I know I was looking for as well. And so I think you can have an impact

**01:10:37** on people in that way. And I also like this question because as anyone who has watched

**01:10:43** through the streams has known, I've made a couple of offhanded remarks about how just

**01:10:47** the past couple months have been hard for me in a bunch of different ways. Like the videos have

**01:10:54** stalled out and videos have been very frustrating to try to complete. And also like the end of the

**01:11:01** pandemic and the creeping speed of vaccines is very difficult. And so it's like a bunch of things

**01:11:07** were kind of coming together of like, oh, these are just a couple of frustrating months here.

**01:11:11** But it just so happened that during this period of time, an unusually large number of people

**01:11:17** happened to just send positive messages about, oh, hey, your videos or your conversations had a big

**01:11:23** impact on my life. And like, here's decisions that I've made based on that. Or, you know, oh,

**01:11:28** I really turned around something after hearing you phrase an idea this way and it really stuck

**01:11:34** with me. And it's really nice to get those kind of messages. And I especially appreciated that the

**01:11:39** coincidences of the universe happened to line up that when I was having a rougher time, it's like,

**01:11:43** oh, I happened to get more of these messages. And it was really nice just to see that and go, oh,

**01:11:47** okay, cool. I'm glad to know that some of this stuff has resonated with people in a positive way.

**01:11:53** So I don't think about it in terms of legacy after I'm gone. I think that's pointless and

**01:12:00** doesn't make any sense. But what I like here is the first part of the question captures a

**01:12:07** specific thing that I do think about a lot, which is making media timeless. And I am very convinced

**01:12:17** that it is quite hard to make media timeless. Like it's easier to write or create things that are

**01:12:25** in reaction to something that is happening right now. And it's harder to try to rewrite it or talk

**01:12:32** about it in a general way. But the big advantage of doing things in the general way is that it can

**01:12:39** last for a long time. Even the dumbest example, like that snow video thing that I just made,

**01:12:45** the very first drafts of it were contextualized of like, oh, my home state, like I'm connected

**01:12:52** to this New York, they've done this thing. And it's much harder to rewrite it in a more general

**01:13:00** way. But also, I think it's better to do it that way if you can, because now this is applicable to

**01:13:07** anyone who's trying to thieves snow days away from children. Like it's not a reaction to the

**01:13:12** specific thing. I'm always really aware I have this pet peeve whenever I'm watching movies with

**01:13:18** my wife that I try not to mention, but I can never help myself, which is movies that pointlessly put

**01:13:25** themselves in an exact place on the timeline. Someone will make a reference and they'll say,

**01:13:29** oh, it's 2008. I think my favorite and worst example of this that exists in any movie ever is

**01:13:36** Love Actually, where you go through the whole movie, it doesn't matter what time it is. It's

**01:13:42** like a charming little movie. Yes, you vaguely know it's a time before cell phones, but who cares?

**01:13:48** And then like three minutes before the movie is going to end, someone mentions that it's 2003.

**01:13:54** And I'm like, God damn it. Like, why? Why did you do that? That is without a doubt one of the worst

**01:14:01** examples I could think of in a movie. But so many movies do this. I just happen to watch Crazy Rich

**01:14:07** Asians and they do the same thing. It's like the very beginning of the movie really pointlessly

**01:14:13** establishes exactly what year it is. And then it never comes up again in the movie. Like why? It's

**01:14:20** a great movie. This is totally like a timeless fun movie, but nope. Like it happens in 2009. And we

**01:14:26** all know that now. Like there are reasons to do it, but you have to have that reason. Yes, exactly.

**01:14:33** And like in Love Actually, the 2003 is just mentioned to make a joke sort of more specifically

**01:14:39** funny. Like there's a way that humor is funnier when it's more specific, but it's just, it's the

**01:14:45** worst. It's the worst one. But so anyway, I just, I mentioned that because I'm just really sensitive

**01:14:49** to this in media when I'm watching something that I think, oh, this has a nice timeless quality.

**01:14:56** And then suddenly kaklunk, they place it. And I feel like you do your media a disservice

**01:15:03** when that happens. But I also totally get why it happens because it's very easy to do. It's very

**01:15:09** easy to not think about. And there is a way when you just say what year it is. Sometimes you can

**01:15:15** make things easier or if you're having a conversation, if you are just reacting to the specific thing

**01:15:22** that is happening, that's way easier, but it's also less applicable to anyone listening in the

**01:15:31** future, which means it has less of a chance of being able to make an impact in the future,

**01:15:37** which then gets to the answer to this question, which is there's less of a chance that it can

**01:15:41** have any legacy at all. I will say I do like this idea of legacy of my lifetime. That is much more

**01:15:49** achievable to me, I think, with the things that I feel like I'm able to do. And that's with

**01:15:54** everything with the podcast and stuff like the theme system. I feel like these are things where

**01:15:59** I know I can have effect in my lifetime. And like you, every time I read somebody,

**01:16:03** send me a message saying about how something that I've made has affected them positively,

**01:16:08** or sometimes you'll see people on the Cortex subreddit saying things like this, that we

**01:16:14** help them focus and they're able to get their degree or whatever. And it's always like a really

**01:16:19** heartwarming and unbelievable in all senses of the word type of thing. It doesn't really feel

**01:16:27** possible sometimes. It's very, it's like really interesting. Like it's a very interesting feeling.

**01:16:31** And I guess really, if I think about it, just having legacy in my lifetime is already like so

**01:16:38** much of a gift anyway. Like what does it matter if it continues afterwards? Literally stop the day

**01:16:43** I die, like whatever. Unless I want to go and make my, you know, like write a play or something,

**01:16:49** but I don't really think I have that in me. This episode is brought to you by Squarespace,

**01:18:25** different projects. I have had mikehullie.net as a website for a while and it was a blog that was

**01:18:30** just not very updated very much. So I just decided to turn that website into a landing page. It's got

**01:18:35** some information about me and all the different stuff that I'm up to. Super easy to do. And I was

**01:18:39** able to make it look exactly how I wanted. Go to squarespace.com slash cortex and you can get a

**01:19:02** and Relay FM. Lachlan asks, what devices is Mike currently commuting to the studio with

**01:19:10** and what bag do I carry daily? So this is kind of interesting actually because when we were packing

**01:19:18** up to leave the studio yesterday and Adina said to me, what are you taking your laptop for? And I said,

**01:19:25** I bring it to and from the studio every single day. And she said, why do you do that? And I said,

**01:19:31** well, the last year and a half has shown me that I need to be ready to not leave the house at any

**01:19:37** moment. So I don't want to be bringing a computer backwards and forwards every day, but I consider

**01:19:44** my MacBook Pro to be my main computer right now. And if I need to be at home for a week,

**01:19:49** just all of a sudden, I want to have access to that computer. So that's what I bring my laptop,

**01:19:55** my MacBook Pro comes with me every day. And when I get to the studio, I plug it into the dock,

**01:20:00** which powers the monitor that I use and that's great. And when I'm at home, I pretty much never

**01:20:05** use it. Also a piece of follow up couch pad, man, that's a great idea, Gray. I have been using my

**01:20:11** 11-inch iPad Pro now is again, like when I'm at home, it's pretty much the only device that I use

**01:20:17** now. It still horrifies me to think that you were sitting on the couch with your phone. So I'm glad

**01:20:21** any more. Yeah. Couch pad, best pad. I'm glad you've done this. So, you know, like I'm reading

**01:20:26** news on it. I'm watching videos on it. I'm social media and messaging and, you know, I'm doing like

**01:20:31** some very light work tasks and stuff, you know, but I'm doing those with the, with the 11-inch

**01:20:36** iPad Pro now instead of the phone, because I'm a fool for some reason. I don't think I broke out

**01:20:41** of the, like, this is my work device mode. I'm just always just thinking about it as the work

**01:20:45** device. But yeah, it can be my everything computer at home rather than my iPhone, which is what I was

**01:20:51** using. So, you know, when I'm at home, I never really use the laptop, but I have feel like I have

**01:20:56** to bring it home in case I can't come to the studio for a few days or whatever. And so that's

**01:21:02** just like become an important thing for me. Eventually, my plan is to not do that, but I'm

**01:21:06** not there yet. But I am still using, I mentioned this bag a long time ago. It's a Tokyo tote pack

**01:21:13** from Bellroy. I love this bag. It's very nice. What I love about this bag is that it's got just

**01:21:20** enough, like organizational stuff in it. But my main thing that I love about it is it is both a

**01:21:26** backpack and a tote bag, which I just find really comfortable because sometimes I don't have a lot

**01:21:32** in there and I can just carry it like a tote bag. But then sometimes I put it on my back, you know,

**01:21:36** like walking to the studio and it's warm and I don't want my backpack on my back because it's warm.

**01:21:41** Yeah, your back gets all sweaty and gross. So I'll just take it off my back. Yeah. And just carry it

**01:21:44** like a tote bag. I really love this bag. I'm very pleased that I found it. And also, as well,

**01:21:51** the other thing that I bring to and from the studio every day, I have a pen case and not co-sing

**01:21:59** clear pen case with a few pens in it. And I put my journal and a subtle notebook there in my bag

**01:22:04** all the time. And similarly, they always go to and from because if I have to be at home for a bit,

**01:22:09** I want to have access to the notebook and journal that I'm using right now. But if I'm at the studio,

**01:22:14** then I use them while I'm here. So they're the things I have every day. And then depending on

**01:22:18** what I'm doing, you know, like I might bring something to the studio or take something home.

**01:22:23** Like I actually imagine that even at the time when I'm leaving my computer here, I will still

**01:22:28** bring my bag to and from work every day. Because sometimes I'm bringing like lunch or whatever,

**01:22:32** you know, like that kind of stuff from home. But I would prefer to not be carrying a computer

**01:22:38** backwards and forwards every day. But I'm not yet at the phase where I'm comfortable with that.

**01:22:44** JS It does look very nice. I just try to think of a way to describe it. It's a bit like,

**01:22:50** we talk about the wheel of email always turns and there's something like this with backpacks.

**01:22:55** It's finding the best backpack is an eternal experience that never ends because you're

**01:23:02** always trying to balance all of these different aspects of how much stuff that you always want

**01:23:08** to overstuff the backpack or it's too heavy or it's, you know, it's too light, but then it

**01:23:11** doesn't carry enough stuff. It's, I'm never fully happy with any of the backpacks that I have,

**01:23:19** but it's because it's a situation where you as a human irrationally want everything.

**01:23:23** JS Well, here's what helped me. I decided I wasn't going to have just one bag. This is my

**01:23:30** commuting to and from the studio bag. JS Yeah, I can see that it really makes sense for that.

**01:23:35** JS When I travel, I'm not going to use this bag. I will go back to probably the Peak Design

**01:23:40** backpack. That's the last one that I used because that's when I do want to fit loads of stuff in a

**01:23:45** bag because I'm going to be away for a bit, you know, but this, I wouldn't be able to get everything

**01:23:50** I would want in here if I was traveling internationally. It's just not going to work for me.

**01:23:55** It's not big enough, but for commuting on the train every day, I don't want a big bag because

**01:23:59** I will put too much stuff in it and it will be too heavy, but this isn't. It's like it's got two

**01:24:04** water bottle pockets in it. You know, I put an umbrella in one because I live in London, right?

**01:24:08** JS Right. JS Like so, yeah, it's like all these little things like perfect. This is exactly what

**01:24:11** I need it to be. I've got an air tag on it now because that's a thing. JS Oh, right. Yes. JS Air

**01:24:15** tags is just like a funny little product because it's like, I don't know if I've ever bought like

**01:24:19** a piece of technology where I hope to never actually use it the way it's supposed to be,

**01:24:24** like what it's for, because to really get the impact out of that product, I have had to have

**01:24:28** lost something. JS Yeah, I don't know. Our tags just arrived today, so I haven't had a chance to

**01:24:32** play around with it, but I know I've used the tile tracker on my keys and that is one of those

**01:24:38** things that I thought I put it on as a lark and then immediately realized, oh, this is a totally

**01:24:43** necessary part of my life in the same way that once you have an Apple watch that can ping your

**01:24:47** phone, your brain goes, Oh great. I never need to remember where my phone is anymore and you just

**01:24:52** ping it. JS So I never have this. I know where my keys are, right? They're in my pocket or they're

**01:24:55** in the dish at home. Like I have no problem with this, but if you have got value out, you wait

**01:25:01** until you try this thing because with your iPhone and with the AirTag, it uses the U1 chip. So it

**01:25:08** finally has a use and you can hold your phone up and it points with an arrow where your keys are.

**01:25:14** JS Mm-hmm. JS It is an arrow like turn by turn directions and it's live updating and so you can

**01:25:19** play hot and cold with your keys. You're going to have a great time. JS Here's the thing. Yes,

**01:25:23** I have a place where the keys go. Like there's, everyone should have this of when you come inside,

**01:25:28** there's a place that the keys go and they always go there and just make your life simple and just

**01:25:31** make a decision about whatever that is. And my keys are always there, but there's just the way

**01:25:39** the universe works is somehow whenever I'm really in a hurry, that's when the keys are not there.

**01:25:47** And like, Oh, they did get left in my jeans pockets, which then went into the laundry pile

**01:25:52** and I just couldn't find them. Right. There's a way in which the universe has, you know, like,

**01:25:58** it's like a trickster God. Right? Who's just waiting. JS Low key. JS Yeah. JS Low key.

**01:26:04** JS That's exactly right. JS That's what it means. JS Yeah. It's just waiting like, Oh, I know tomorrow

**01:26:08** he's really going to need those keys. Let me just take them off the hook and put them in his pocket

**01:26:12** and put it in the laundry. JS Did you get them engraved the AirTags? JS Yeah. I figured that

**01:26:16** that was a necessary feature to get them. JS Good. It really is. They look terrible about

**01:26:20** the engraving. I think it's so plain. I like it. Like we've got one of my initials on it. I got

**01:26:25** the nice little brown key ring. I think it's like a very handsome key ring. And also, do you remember

**01:26:30** how the iPod nanos used to get all beat up, like all scuffed? That's what happens to these. And I

**01:26:35** actually really liked that look. Because it's just polished aluminium, right on the back. So it just

**01:26:42** gets scratched up to high heaven. And I just think it looks very nice. Like I actually kind of like

**01:26:47** the aesthetic. It feels nostalgic for me. JS I literally haven't even touched them. My wife

**01:26:51** just happened to be opening the box as I was coming in to record the Cortex podcast. So I saw

**01:26:55** them briefly, but I did think, Oh, they seem bigger. This is one of the rare times where I thought,

**01:27:00** I wish Apple didn't go with a replaceable battery and had some weird wireless charging thing. Like,

**01:27:05** please. They just seem like they're a little too big and annoying, but I don't know. Do you disagree

**01:27:11** with me on that? Why are you saying, Oh my God? JS Because if they didn't do the replaceable

**01:27:16** battery, it was going to cost like $30 a year or whatever for these things. I'll say as well,

**01:27:22** I wondered if they were maybe a bit too big, but I actually really liked the size of my keyring.

**01:27:27** It's just nice and easy to grab. I'm sending you a, an iMessage picture now so you can see just how

**01:27:33** dinged up mine is already. I think it looks fantastic. I love the look of it. JS But that

**01:27:37** is very dinged up. But how long have you had this? Like a week? JS A couple of weeks. JS Okay. JS

**01:27:42** I mean, my keys are constantly smashing into this thing, right? Like that's why this is happening.

**01:27:48** JS Right. JS Because the thing that is touching them is sharp pieces of metal. JS Right. Of course.

**01:27:53** Okay. JS But I just think it looks really cool. JS Okay. All right. Well, well, I'll see. Let's

**01:27:57** close this bracket and get back to one last ask cortex. JS Which one? JS I'll just do a quick

**01:28:03** update here. Michael has asked about how I gave up breakfast and then noted that many episodes ago,

**01:28:10** I mentioned that I was also conducting a war on lunch and Hey, how's that going?

**01:28:15** JS Yep. JS The answer is I completely lost the war on lunch and totally failed at the time that

**01:28:20** I was trying to do it, but I am once again taking on the war on lunch. Like I have not, I have not

**01:28:27** completely given up this project. I put it aside for several months and it has been reinvigorated

**01:28:35** in the last week to make an attempt to get rid of lunch. So, so far it's going better than last

**01:28:41** time. I suspect this might be like how it went with the war on breakfast, where it took me a

**01:28:46** couple of goes to really make it work. And so now I'm trying take two on the war on lunch. So I'll

**01:28:53** keep you posted. JS I actually just want to reference one last question before we finish today,

**01:28:57** which is Quentin's question, which is, does it feel like it's been more than five years already,

**01:29:01** which is, I assume in reference to how long we've been recording this show. I merely want to

**01:29:06** mention this because between now and our next episode, we've been recording this show for six

**01:29:10** years. JS Don't tell me that, Mike. Don't tell me that. JS I just wanted to let you know.

**01:29:14** JS Thanks. Getmoretex.com. JS Oh yeah, don't forget. What was the line?

**01:29:20** JS I forgot. JS All of this and Moretex, was that it?

**01:29:24** JS All of this and Moretex. JS At getmoretex.com.

**01:29:28** JS Play the trailer. Quite on set.

**01:29:32** JS Our story begins with three mild-mannered podcasters heading out for a beverage at the

**01:29:40** local tavern. Little do these three know that they are not about to enter the familiar doors

**01:29:44** of the old Badger and Thistle, but are about to be whisked across time and space.

**01:29:49** JS Probably going to need to have some ID if you're looking to get far in this world.

**01:29:56** JS Spit, my friends, they're without proper identification, you know.

**01:30:01** Where can I help them get some ID? JS Sounds like you need to go to the

**01:30:04** Department of Misplaced Persons. JS

**01:30:09** So I'm going to apply the Newton Effect, my special shtick, and I'm going to try to make

**01:30:14** the infinity of this building drop away to something that would be actually in a building.

**01:30:20** JS Alright, suddenly it is like an earthquake. A great trembling. All the rats look up and

**01:30:27** giant kind of steel girders erupt from the ground. The ceiling seems to kind of lower as

**01:30:33** the girders rise to meet it. From the horizon, walls start to close in, but it's like a tsunami

**01:30:40** of architecture. JS Wait a second everyone, Jason just changed the freaking world.

**01:30:48** Like the whole world rotated around us. Obviously this is some kind of simulation that we're living

**01:30:55** in. And or Jason is a god. JS

**01:31:00** Look, we're not getting anywhere without our phones, so I'm going to happily insert my phone

**01:31:05** into the mysterious space slot. JS You insert your phone into the mysterious space slot,

**01:31:09** it makes some sounds kind of like a 1960s computer, and then a panel on the front of

**01:31:14** the dispensing machine opens up and a little display prompts you to put your hand into that slot.

**01:31:20** JS Sure. I'm, you know what, we're not getting anywhere without phones, so yes.

**01:31:25** I will do whatever the machine wants. JS A little shield drops down with a little circle kind of

**01:31:30** holding your wrist in place. And then there's a sound kind of like a giant stapler. Your hand

**01:31:35** is warm. Your phone seems to be now somewhat embedded in your hand. Can you just remind the

**01:31:45** listeners what the John Doe effect does? JS It says that I have one of those faces where people

**01:31:51** constantly think they recognize me as an old coworker or long lost cousin, childhood friend,

**01:31:56** etc. You may also be mistaken for someone who owes money slash is wanted dead or alive, etc.

**01:32:04** JS Hey, Calvin, it's me! JS Oh, right. Hi.

**01:32:08** JS The large orangutan person kind of bolts up from the bench, sending the bench kind of

**01:32:13** shifting back. A larger orangutan person has grabbed both of your arms and is attempting to

**01:32:20** pull them off of your body. Let's just make a quick strength check here.

**01:32:24** JS I rolled a six. So six plus four is 10, which is bad enough.

**01:32:28** JS I am going to tell you that you are going to take three points of damage. Your arm is

**01:32:33** really badly hurt and you are not feeling great. The horrible orangutan thing is kind of growling

**01:32:40** in your face. JS You are drawing the attention of several rats when the seam on your voluminous

**01:32:48** pocket gives out and she starts pouring out of a hole in your jumpsuit onto the floor of the

**01:32:55** office. Several rats are giving you scandalous looks, Jason. JS I pretend like nothing has

**01:33:00** happened and continue moving toward the mail room, oiling my bucket.

**01:33:04** JS Will our heroes ever get the documents that they need to return to their normal lives?

**01:33:10** Will Jason stop tormenting space rats? Will Grey's arm heal? Or do worse things lie ahead for him?
