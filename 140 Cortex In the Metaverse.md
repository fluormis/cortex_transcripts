# Cortex - 140: Cortex: In the Metaverse
**00:00:00** Oh, hello.

**00:00:00** Yes. Hello, CGP Grey.

**00:00:03** Oh, it's funny bumping into you here. What is this?

**00:00:05** This is different. We're doing something different this time.

**00:00:07** This is the first ever Cortex special episode.

**00:00:10** Oh, a special episode? What does that mean?

**00:00:12** It's shorter.

**00:00:15** Listeners, I'm putting Mike on the spot there a little bit by going,

**00:00:18** what does this mean? Because we don't actually really know what this means.

**00:00:21** No.

**00:00:21** That's why this is a Cortex special. We sort of tried a thing and wanted to talk about it

**00:00:28** and feel like, does it make sense to fit in the regular show? I don't know. How long are we

**00:00:33** going to talk about it? I don't know. So we thought let's do a Cortex special episode.

**00:00:39** Cortex colon in the metaverse.

**00:00:43** So we bought Quest Pros.

**00:00:44** Yeah.

**00:00:45** I want to tell you how this unfolded, right? So meta had an event.

**00:00:49** Already I have a problem with this.

**00:00:51** Okay.

**00:00:52** It's Facebook.

**00:00:53** No, it's not. I'm not doing it.

**00:00:54** Here's the thing. You can say meta, right? I'm probably going to say Facebook.

**00:00:58** That's fine.

**00:00:59** But I do just think we're still at the time when you say meta where most people are not

**00:01:04** going to translate that straight away in their head as Facebook. This is different than the,

**00:01:10** oh, it's not Google. It's alphabet thing, right? Which was like alphabet tried to push that for

**00:01:15** a while and everyone was like, no, sit down. You're Google. And that's just how this is going to work.

**00:01:20** But I do think Facebook is doing a much better job of rebranding. Like we are meta.

**00:01:27** Facebook is one of our products. But if you just start a sentence right now at this period in time,

**00:01:33** like not enough people are going to do that translation in their head.

**00:01:36** No, that's fair. So meta had an event, right? Where they unveiled the Quest Pro and took a

**00:01:43** look at what the future would be like for their platforms, including like a bunch of

**00:01:49** things that seemed interesting, but who knows if they'll ever actually be true.

**00:01:53** And one of the things they really focused on was their VR meetings products, Horizon workrooms

**00:02:00** being their like thing, because it is unbelievable how many brands they do have. I don't know why

**00:02:06** it's called Horizon. Why I don't know why I need to call it meta workrooms. Like I don't know why

**00:02:09** it needs to have its own name again. Right. There's so many names. They have meta has the

**00:02:14** meta quest. The meta quest is also a meta quest pro, which used to be called Oculus. And they

**00:02:21** still use the Oculus like logo in some places, which doesn't make any sense. But now it's the

**00:02:27** meta quest logo. And also they have software called Horizon, which is another brand, because

**00:02:35** they have Horizon workrooms and Horizon worlds. It's branding that I find all over the place and

**00:02:41** confusing. Even for little stuff, like trying to pull up the app on my phone, I'm still searching

**00:02:47** for Oculus. Like, Oh, no, it's not Oculus. Is it the meta thing? No, it's Quest. And then trying

**00:02:52** to search for Quest. And you go, no, it's not Quest. It's like the meta something app. It's,

**00:02:57** they need someone to come in and like straighten out language and reduce the number of words.

**00:03:02** It's almost like it's something you would do during a rebrand. Indeed. But nevertheless. So

**00:03:07** one of the things that we do with the company that we run together is at least once a month,

**00:03:12** we have a long meeting where we go over everything that's going on with Cortex brand. We talk about

**00:03:18** the things that we're working on. We talk about where we want to go. And we have been using

**00:03:23** FaceTime or Skype, but all audio for these. I was going to say we've, we only use FaceTime audio.

**00:03:29** FaceTime, of course. Actual FaceTime, FaceTime. No, no, I have no interest in doing this.

**00:03:34** And then usually Gray's walking around with some ducks or there was a time of a swamp or something.

**00:03:39** Who could tell? You hear ducks. If I'm out walking a dog, you hear me comment on like the vultures.

**00:03:44** If I'm in North Carolina, that's, that's what you're thinking of. I'm walking through the swamp

**00:03:48** and like, Oh, there's a snake crossing my back. But for times where we don't need that we're

**00:03:52** in fixed positions. And I thought it would be super interesting to try these meetings in VR.

**00:04:00** To see what that would look like. Like mine and your meeting is like one of two meetings that are

**00:04:07** fixed on my calendar. Like I don't really do these kinds of things a lot. So I don't have a lot of

**00:04:10** opportunities to try this stuff. And also considering like our meetings are becoming more

**00:04:16** multimedia over time, right? Yeah. Images and charts and stuff. And so the more I was sort of

**00:04:23** the clips of Horizon workrooms and things like that, I thought, Hmm, this could be interesting.

**00:04:28** So we wanted to try it out. Yeah, you pitched this to me. I think I was quite doubtful at first.

**00:04:36** It is the fact that like our meetings are actually talking about products. Like we want to be looking

**00:04:41** at stuff. And so I was like, Oh, I'm like, minorly intrigued. And then you sweeten the deal. You're

**00:04:47** like, Hey, we could just try this a few times and then just record an episode about how it went. And

**00:04:53** I was like, okay, now I'm in like, there's a Cortex special episode. Like I always want two

**00:04:58** reasons to do a thing. And it's like, thank you. I've gotten my second reason now. So this is how

**00:05:03** this Cortex special episode came to be. We're going to talk about what it was like trying to use the

**00:05:09** Quest Pro, metas VR headset and their horizons work rooms to do actual work. We're not talking

**00:05:21** about playing VR games. We're actually using it to hold real meetings about company stuff. And

**00:05:28** I suspect we may be one of a tiny, tiny number of people on the planet earth who are actually

**00:05:37** doing this. But yeah, so let's talk about how that went. One of the ways in which I think

**00:05:43** it is conceivable that we are one of the small group of people actually doing it

**00:05:47** is when we tried to do it for basically a week and it, the horizon work room just was not working.

**00:05:53** And I could not find anything online of anyone talking about the fact that it was not working

**00:06:01** for the best part of a week. This is like a couple of months ago. Yeah. Neither of us could join

**00:06:06** meetings. The other one was setting up. That was really frustrating. Like that was the first time

**00:06:10** we'd sat down to do it as it like, and we were like, all right, let's do this thing. And then we just

**00:06:15** could not get anything to work. Yeah. That's, that's totally the case. I think you are

**00:06:20** reverse exaggerating because all told it took us more than a week to like get everything working.

**00:06:27** I cannot conceive of how a normal person would have done this because I feel like, Oh,

**00:06:33** I'm a pretty tech savvy person who already bought the first generation Oculus. So I'm like

**00:06:40** already familiar with how a bunch of this stuff works. I have the accounts that were already set

**00:06:46** up, like ready to go. And now I'm just trying to upgrade to this new professional business version

**00:06:52** of a VR headsets. And I've never in my life had so many just astounding technical problems,

**00:07:01** getting a piece of technology to work, even on just the most simple of levels, getting the apps

**00:07:08** to install, getting everything to work. It took absolutely forever. And then we just had weird

**00:07:14** like server problems on metas end, where it's like, I can't recognize you as a user. I do

**00:07:21** actually think we may be one of a dozen people who have really used this to hold actual business

**00:07:26** meetings. Because I think if you're trying to get four or five people together, there's no way

**00:07:33** one of those people doesn't run into just like a normal person technical nonstarter for making it

**00:07:38** happen. This is why I also like having two reasons to do something. Because if we weren't going to

**00:07:45** record a show talking about the experience, this is also the moment this would have died. And it

**00:07:50** just would have been like, forget it. It's just simply not worth it in terms of the difficulty of

**00:07:55** actually getting something set up. I would describe the onboarding experience as extremely

**00:08:02** not good. Yeah, not good. So the end result of this was that we joked like, Oh, we've just spent

**00:08:09** two grand not to have a meeting. That was that was how it felt. It was really frustrating getting

**00:08:16** this set up. It was partly I was so surprised because it actually was a really nice experience.

**00:08:25** The physical hardware of the Quest Pro compared to the original generation oculus slash quest that I

**00:08:32** bought. I like I don't know how you felt, but like when I opened it up and first got my hands on it,

**00:08:37** because I really just didn't even have any idea what this product was going to be like. This was

**00:08:41** where I was like quite impressed. It kind of felt like in the early days of the iPhone where it's

**00:08:47** like each generation is significantly better than the previous one. Yeah, that first generation

**00:08:52** Quest, like I'm thrilled that I got it. But you know, it's not the best. But this hardware felt

**00:09:00** much better. Everything about it. It was way more comfortable to wear. It's lighter. It felt nicer.

**00:09:07** I love the little charging dock. Charging dock is such a winner. Such a winner. Yeah, this is one of

**00:09:12** those little things like I didn't even think I would have wanted a charging dock. But the moment

**00:09:16** I had it, it's like, Oh, great. In my office, I have it just behind me here. And it actually looks

**00:09:22** really nice on a shelf just sitting in the charging dock. Yeah. So on a hardware side,

**00:09:27** this is a headset that I'm not quite sure I would say felt like something a normal person would use.

**00:09:36** But it at least felt a lot closer to that. It doesn't just feel like it's an interesting tech

**00:09:42** demo, or it's something for people who are really into tech. It's approaching a normal use tool was

**00:09:48** the way I kind of felt about the hardware. Yeah. I mean, it also feels like a professional

**00:09:53** version of the Quest, which is exactly what it's supposed to be. Yeah. There's something about the

**00:09:58** design. It is more sleek. Yeah. It doesn't look so much like a toy. Like it has an element to it,

**00:10:05** which is more professional in its design. And that comes from the packaging to the physical design

**00:10:11** of the kind of like glass front of it. Right. And then also the charging dock and you know,

**00:10:17** it all just feels like a more professional package, which I mean, you know, for its price,

**00:10:22** it should. Right. Yeah. So I actually think like hardware wise, I think they did a pretty decent

**00:10:30** job with it. I wanted to ask you because in some of the reviews that I'd seen, there were pretty

**00:10:36** mixed feelings about how much light it can let in compared to other VR headsets. And I wanted to

**00:10:43** like, they give you these kind of like rubber blinkers basically is the best way that I can

**00:10:47** describe them that are an optional that you can choose to put on or not. Like for me, for our use

**00:10:54** cases of using it in meetings, I actually quite liked it because we were using a lot of the

**00:11:00** pass through stuff as well. Right. So that having just natural light from my office come in felt

**00:11:07** right for what I was using it for. But I've played some games using this

**00:11:12** and I don't feel as immersed as I have it with the regular quest, which does a way

**00:11:19** better job, I feel, of keeping the outside out. I don't know. I wonder if this is intentional

**00:11:27** so that you don't entirely lose your sense of a little bit of place. The ideal fitting allows you

**00:11:34** to look straight down and kind of see where your feet are or see your hands. I don't know. I get

**00:11:40** the feeling that they've done that on purpose. Like if they wanted this to be a totally sealed

**00:11:46** environment, I think they could have designed it that way. So I think this is on purpose.

**00:11:51** I think so too. And I think when they were talking about it, they were like referencing the idea that

**00:11:56** this is much more of a mixed reality headset than a VR headset, which is again, they made the

**00:12:04** pass through way better. The pass through is color. So you know, you can use the cameras and you can

**00:12:09** see the outside world. Yeah. So what Mike's talking about there with pass through is

**00:12:15** you have the headset on, you're looking at the virtual world and it has this feature where if

**00:12:20** you sort of just physically double tap like anywhere on the side of the device, it's not a button. It's

**00:12:24** just recognizing that like you've hit it somewhere. It turns off the VR world and lets you look

**00:12:29** through the cameras that are on the outside of the actual headset. And it's a surprisingly useful

**00:12:36** feature. When I first heard of that, I thought like, when are you really going to use this? But

**00:12:40** you actually use it all the time. And it is nice to be able to do stuff where you don't have to

**00:12:45** physically take the headset off because it is always a bit jarring to go like back and forth

**00:12:50** between having the headset on and having it off. So it is good that they have this mode where you

**00:12:54** can look through the cameras. It's not amazing resolution. It always kind of makes me think of

**00:13:00** being like RoboCop, right? You just have like this terrible VHS vision of the world. There was a

**00:13:05** funny moment where we were having a VR call and there was a package delivered to my house. So the

**00:13:10** bell rang. It's like, oh, but I was able to turn on pass through and just let the person in and like

**00:13:16** talk through the intercom in the building without having to ever take the headset off. And I realized

**00:13:20** like, oh, this is actually great. This is the whole purpose of this. And yeah, having it in color does

**00:13:26** make a really big difference versus black and white in the old systems. So I do think with each

**00:13:31** generation, we see that this is making it slimmer and smaller and sort of more a device that can

**00:13:37** fit into your life on the physical side of it. But when you set it up, you have to create

**00:13:44** an avatar of yourself. You sure do. How are you going to be represented in the metaverse? Now,

**00:13:54** I have a lot of feelings about this experience, but I would like to know, Mike, what did you think

**00:13:59** of this experience of creating Metaverse Mike? I was pretty happy with it. To be honest, it was

**00:14:06** a decent enough character creation system. Like I felt like I could go in and create someone who

**00:14:14** looks enough like me. I mean, I have like enough generic nerd energy that they had the options for

**00:14:21** me, right? They had good glasses options and beard options and clothing options. Like I could make a

**00:14:26** version of me that was easy enough. You know, I've played around with like the Instagram avatar

**00:14:32** thing or whatever, right? Like they've done enough of this over time that I think they could do a

**00:14:37** decent enough job. Kind of like, you know, me emoji ish. Yeah. They look different to the way that

**00:14:44** Apple does them, but it's similar in that like without too much effort, I think I was able to

**00:14:49** create someone that I felt represented me because, you know, that is what people typically do. You

**00:14:57** know, especially if you're going to be like, Oh, hey, it's me. I'm going to meet with you. Right?

**00:15:00** So what did you think of the character creation tools? By far and away, this was my least

**00:15:09** enjoyed part of the entire experience. I hate everything about the character creation process

**00:15:14** in the metaverse, just with this burning passion. Okay. I just found all of it to be really

**00:15:21** unpleasant, unappealing and ugly. There's a problem that I think kind of runs through a lot of the

**00:15:28** horizon metaverse stuff, like the metaverse stuff that Facebook itself is making, not stuff that

**00:15:34** third party developers are making. And I don't know a better way to phrase this, but when you say like

**00:15:41** you had nerd energy, right? I think there is a certain kind of nerd aesthetic. You know, when

**00:15:49** you have, for example, like you buy an app on the app store and it's made by a single developer and

**00:15:55** I buy and use and love tons of these apps, but there is a certain kind of nerd aesthetic that

**00:16:02** can like leak through all of these things where you go, ah, the person who made this is very

**00:16:08** technically competent, but it does not necessarily have a like nice design aesthetic. And the thing

**00:16:16** that I kept thinking of, like looking at the avatar stuff is I found all of it just kind of repulsive.

**00:16:22** I hate the way all of it looks. And I kept thinking like, can you guys please, please just like hire

**00:16:30** one former person who worked at Pixar to try to make this stuff look cuter. So they have been doing

**00:16:37** a bunch of stuff here. Like one, they do have like new versions of their avatar system. This was some

**00:16:43** of the stuff that like they announced at the same time they announced the MetroQuest pro. They

**00:16:47** announced like two things, which was like, one, we're going to have like new versions of the avatars

**00:16:53** and two, we're creating a system where we will be able to scan your actual face.

**00:16:59** Okay. Look, like no, you're making it worse. But like it was a lot that both of these things were

**00:17:05** very like in the future, right? And I was kind of suckered into that. Like I thought that the new

**00:17:11** versions of the horizon avatars were going to be available like now, but then not, but these new

**00:17:17** ones, they do have more of a Pixar like look to them. I think, I mean, look, whatever. I can't

**00:17:25** judge the way that things are in the future. I'm just a little bit doubtful that Facebook can pull

**00:17:29** this off well, because I feel like this is a recurring theme for a lot of their stuff is,

**00:17:36** it just has this like unpleasant look to it. You need a nice designer to come in here and like

**00:17:41** smooth off a lot of the corners. Like just make a, like a large number of small tweaks that add up

**00:17:46** to make a thing look much nicer. So yeah, I found like, I just hate every part of this. Like

**00:17:54** to me on the internet, nobody knows you're a dog kind of person.

**00:17:57** Yeah. I mean, I will say, I think you are the wrong person, right? When it comes to like,

**00:18:02** create an avatar that's meant to be you, you are definitely not the target market for someone who's

**00:18:09** going to ever enjoy that experience. Yeah. I totally granted. Like I'm not the market or the

**00:18:13** person who like wants to build a virtual model of themselves. I'm like extremely on the end of like,

**00:18:19** oh, I hate this. Cause like you decided to do that. Right. And what you did in your life is to create

**00:18:26** a stick figure, right? Like you had the opportunity to make a decision about a virtual avatar that

**00:18:31** would represent you in the world. And you've made that decision and you went with like,

**00:18:37** what is the simplest thing that can be done? I abstracted away the concept of a person so much.

**00:18:43** I don't even have a mouth in my representation of myself, right? I don't have eyes that look at

**00:18:48** anything, right? Like it couldn't be less of an image that looks like a person. So I was very keen

**00:18:53** to see CGP gray in meta world. I was very keen. I wondered what I was going to get, you know,

**00:19:01** I will say there was no way I could have expected what I got.

**00:19:06** Would you like to describe your meta avatar aesthetic to people? Okay. So I made myself

**00:19:13** the cutest cortex in cowgirl that I possibly could. I don't know how you found my virtual

**00:19:20** representation to myself. I think it was just about as cute as I could have possibly made it,

**00:19:26** which is not very cute in the metaverse. I think it's still kind of horrifying and ugly. And I

**00:19:31** could not believe how, how much work it took to make it look halfway decent. But yeah, like I spent

**00:19:40** maybe two seconds trying to be like, Oh, I'll try to make a thing that looks like me. And then I

**00:19:45** thought like, no, I hate this. I'm not going to do that. I'm going to pick something that doesn't

**00:19:48** look like me because I don't know. This is a virtual world. Like why am I now being limited

**00:19:55** by the way that I look in reality? Like, why do I have to make some decision about,

**00:20:01** Oh, how fat am I on one to 10 pick these bodies? Which one do you think is you?

**00:20:07** Oh, what does your face look like? I hate every single part of it.

**00:20:11** I will say I did have that part with a buddy where I was like, had to make a decision.

**00:20:15** Yeah. And it's just kind of like, I don't want to make this decision. Like why are you making me

**00:20:19** make this decision? Here's the thing. I know that I am not the market for this, but I think there's

**00:20:25** something that you like as a user, if you're, again, you're not like in nerd world, you're just

**00:20:31** giving this to a regular person. Something you need to understand listeners is that they have 10 body

**00:20:38** types. The body types only vary basically in how fat they are. And the body types are also unisex.

**00:20:47** You know, I didn't know that.

**00:20:48** So you just picked you and you're like, Oh, I'll just pick one of these bodies.

**00:20:52** And I was like, I don't want to be me. I'm going to be a cowgirl. Right? So I'm like,

**00:20:56** where do I flip the switch for a female body? And then I realized, Oh, there is no switch.

**00:21:02** The 10 bodies are just the ones that you pick from. And so it was part of the reason why it's

**00:21:09** like, Oh, to make my avatar look feminine, I have to pick all of these like really screamingly

**00:21:17** feminine accessories, right? There has to be earrings. There has to be heart shaped glasses.

**00:21:24** I have to put lipstick on. I have to put makeup on. I had to make my hair pink and in braids,

**00:21:30** because otherwise the body doesn't read remotely as a female body because there's only 10

**00:21:38** generically shaped bodies on a scale of fat to thin. And like, that's it. And I like,

**00:21:44** I can understand why Facebook is doing this, but it's so strange to me because it's like,

**00:21:50** guys, video games have had this solved for like 30 years where if you're doing character creation,

**00:21:58** one of the first things is often they're like, Hey, do you want a male body, a female body or a

**00:22:03** neutral body? And then you pick one of those three. But like a lot of games now, they just label it

**00:22:08** differently. Right? Like just like body type one, body type two. And then that's your starting block

**00:22:14** for where you want to move from. And like, the way that I've now realized that they've done it,

**00:22:20** I think it might be worse. Yeah, it's it's way worse. Like I applaud having this as an option,

**00:22:25** right? That like there is one body type, whatever, but they're not allowing people to customize it

**00:22:31** when it is supposed to be a representation of you. Yeah, that's very strange to me. I've got

**00:22:37** to say that's very strange. Just to continue, like what I think video games have done so well is

**00:22:41** again, like they give you that template and here's sliders. So you can choose things like how far

**00:22:47** apart are the shoulders? You have some like bust slider, right? Which you could decide like,

**00:22:52** how does this go? Waist, hips, like you can do things to make your body look the way you wanted

**00:22:57** to in the game or if you're trying to represent yourself, like make it look the way you look.

**00:23:03** But it was just so weird and strange to realize all of a sudden like, oh, the 10 bodies they let

**00:23:12** you choose from that only vary on scale of fatness have to represent everybody. There's no option to

**00:23:22** masculinize or feminize or neutralize this body. It's just this one way I think is going to be

**00:23:29** incredibly off putting to huge numbers of people when they try it. I actually had my wife, like I

**00:23:35** didn't tell her anything about it. I was just like, hey, why don't you build an avatar in here? And

**00:23:39** like her very first questions were about like making the body actually look like her body.

**00:23:45** And she was appalled when she realized that she couldn't. She was like, oh, I have to look like

**00:23:48** this. I hate it. I never want to use it. I was like, wow, that's an amazing reaction. Now for me

**00:23:54** personally, I just kind of don't want to think about the way that I physically look. And so I'd

**00:24:00** rather just have an avatar that was like abstracted. And so this is also another place where the reason

**00:24:07** I made just like, oh, this cute cortex and cowgirl is because I was also surprised that they didn't

**00:24:14** have any non-human options or just like generic presence options. My only frame of reference with

**00:24:23** this is just like Apple's Memoji, which I went to go see like, oh, how did they set that up when

**00:24:28** like Apple makes this little cartoon representation of yourself. And they play a little video that

**00:24:33** just shows like, oh, here's all the options that you can be. And it plays like, oh, here's three

**00:24:38** people. And then it shows like, oh, someone makes themselves like, oh, it's a person, but they have

**00:24:42** purple skin. So you can do whatever you want. And then the next one is like, or you can just be a

**00:24:47** shark. Like it's fine. You could do whatever you want to do. And so I find it anti the spirit of the

**00:24:56** internet that you're constrained to your human physicality in this really weird way in the

**00:25:05** avatar creation process. I was just absolutely blown away that they didn't have like non-human,

**00:25:13** but still like, you know, business professional options that you could pick. I couldn't believe

**00:25:17** it. And then when I tried to do like, I want something that looks nothing like me, I'm going

**00:25:21** to be this cortex and cowgirl. I was appalled again in the limits of like, making it look the way that

**00:25:27** I wanted to. I thought it was just so awful. And I think people are really going to be put off on

**00:25:31** that. Again, for me, I like being me. I prefer that whenever I'm using these things, if I look at

**00:25:40** myself, it's me, if it's showing a character, I recognize that it's me. I mean, you know, maybe

**00:25:47** I'm aided in the fact that it was easy to make me. And that it also doesn't bother me in general to

**00:25:53** have that where like, I think that me and you are coming from different worlds when it comes to

**00:25:59** identity online, right? Oh, totally. Yeah. Anyway, so that ended up taking up like an

**00:26:05** entire afternoon of my life was just trying to make something that looked okay so that we could

**00:26:09** have a meeting. This episode of cortex is brought to you by Hello. Have you ever tried a buckwheat

**00:26:15** pillow? They're incredibly different from the fluffy soft pillows that most people are used to.

**00:26:21** A buckwheat pillow supports your head and your neck exactly how you want it to. Unlike traditional

**00:26:26** squishy soft pillows, which collapse under the weight of your head and do not give you the

**00:26:31** support that you are looking for while you sleep. Soft pillows allow your neck to fall in a downward

**00:26:37** bend, adding uncomfortable pressure to muscles, nerves and discs over time. This is not what you

**00:26:44** get with a hollow pillow. You get the exact support you're looking for. I am so happy that

**00:26:49** Hello is back sponsoring Cortex because I get to tell you about a product that I absolutely adore.

**00:26:56** I sleep every single night on a hollow pillow and it gives me so much comfort. I used to sleep with

**00:27:02** multiple pillows stacked on top of each other before so I could get the support that I wanted,

**00:27:06** but for many years now, I think three or four years, I have slept every night on one hollow

**00:27:13** pillow and I get the exact support that I'm looking for. But that's not all. Hollow pillows

**00:27:18** stay cool and dry. Most pillows absorb and retain body heat and moisture so your pillow feels warm

**00:27:24** and humid, kind of gross, buckwheat breeze better. So you no longer need to flip your pillow to the

**00:27:29** cool side because it just stays cool. If you, like me, were using multiple pillows or folding your

**00:27:35** pillow in some way to attempt to get that proper support you were looking for, that is a sign that

**00:27:40** your pillow isn't firm or thick enough. Hollow's support allows you to keep your head and neck where

**00:27:45** you want them and you can go that one step further by adding or removing the filling from the zippered

**00:27:51** opening to make sure that you get it exactly to your liking and you'll get it just right. You can

**00:27:57** also remove the filling completely and wash the case as well if you want to do that. People have

**00:28:02** been sleeping on buckwheat pillows for centuries. They have been used in Japan extensively and remain

**00:28:07** relatively popular to this day. You might also see them on the pillow menu at some luxurious hotels,

**00:28:14** but bring that luxury to your own bed every night. Hollow is made in the USA with quality

**00:28:20** construction and materials. The certified organic cotton case is cut in some for durability and the

**00:28:25** buckwheat is grown and milled in the United States. People, like me, really love this pillow. You can

**00:28:31** go to their website and check out the reviews written by customers. Cortex listeners can sleep

**00:28:36** on a Hollow pillow for 60 nights and if it isn't right for you, just ship it back and they will

**00:28:41** give you a full refund. Just go to hollowpillow.com slash cortex and if you try more than one pillow,

**00:28:47** you can get a discount of up to $20 per pillow depending on the size. You can get fast free

**00:28:52** shipping on every order and 1% of all profits are donated to the Nature Conservancy. Why not give

**00:28:57** the gift of better sleep as well, which you know you're going to want to do once you're hooked on

**00:29:01** your own Hollow pillow. Hollow is a unique gift for friends and family and they're going to appreciate

**00:29:06** it every night. So go to hollowpillow.com slash cortex. That's h-u-l-l-o-p-i-l-l-o-w dot com slash

**00:29:14** cortex and you can try it out for 60 days. So thanks to Hollow for the support of this show and relay FM.

**00:29:21** Moving past the avatar creation. Let's talk about the actual meetings. When I finally did

**00:29:27** show up in the meeting, poor Mike, not knowing what's going to happen.

**00:29:30** Gray having spent like the most frustrating afternoon of his life trying to create something

**00:29:34** and then popping into existence. Hi, it's time for serious haha business time, but I also have on

**00:29:40** these heart-shaped eyeglasses. It couldn't have been more surprising for me really. Like I actually

**00:29:45** don't know if there is a way in which I could have been more surprised. But what I will say is like

**00:29:49** we had, you know, we'll talk about the meeting in detail, but like over the time and now we've had a

**00:29:54** few of these, it's not weird to me anymore. And I think that is maybe my biggest takeaway from this

**00:30:02** experience. So we've spent all told maybe four or five hours in Horizon workroom meetings at this

**00:30:10** point. And I have found it to be a very normal feeling experience for having the meetings.

**00:30:21** And I have memories of these meetings, like a decision we made. I remember being in the meeting

**00:30:31** room that we sat and talking about it with you, right? Like I remember that like I would remember

**00:30:38** if we were actually in a room, like overall my experience of having these meetings in Horizon

**00:30:46** workrooms has been very positive. I feel really bad because I just realized it never occurred to

**00:30:52** me until this moment, really, that you're having this meetings with cowgirl cortex. I think I just

**00:30:59** never really thought about that from your perspective. Like we are having these like serious

**00:31:04** conversations, but I do think this totally speaks for this magic power of VR that your brain just

**00:31:16** accepts it as real, which is why I would continue to push for, Oh, you know, you should be able to

**00:31:21** just be an octopus in this meeting. I just think that's going to be really difficult for them to

**00:31:26** try and pitches like a business tool though. Like I don't think like management consultancy company,

**00:31:32** ABC is going to really want their employees to be showing up as like Cthulhu to the next meeting

**00:31:39** or whatever, you know? Look, I think they can limit it. And I also still think like Apple does a very

**00:31:43** good job of it with the mimojis of even their non-human ones fit into a design aesthetic that

**00:31:50** kind of matches the human ones. Like, look, we can talk about it later if Apple ever gets into this

**00:31:54** market, but like, I'm going to be very curious about what Apple does with regards to this,

**00:32:00** if this ever happens, but I think you're going to be happy with the rumors, but we'll see. I'm

**00:32:04** sure I won't be, but if you have not tried VR, this to me is the most difficult to explain part of it

**00:32:13** that is like, is the most interesting insight into something about your brain,

**00:32:18** that your brain is built to accept the visual world as real, no matter how strange it may look.

**00:32:27** Now there are some asterisks on that for like, you can do this better and you can do this worse,

**00:32:33** but it is still basically true. And I also have that same experience of, I have a lot of things

**00:32:42** to complain about this system, but there's something here. There's something here that is

**00:32:48** interesting and that is different and that your brain does treat it as real. Okay. So let me

**00:32:57** give like the most concrete example that I can think of. One of the problems I find with doing

**00:33:03** a FaceTime call with people is it's very hard to do pauses naturally. So when you're doing a FaceTime

**00:33:11** conversation where you're looking at a person, I find people tend to just alternate kind of

**00:33:18** monologuing or like you, you talk in longer unbroken stretches than you would in real life.

**00:33:24** You interrupt each other less and it's awkward to do the thing where you both just sort of

**00:33:32** pause or you like look around as you would do in real life. I'm not entirely sure why that happens,

**00:33:41** but one of the things that a virtual meeting, I found that we both kind of did it immediately

**00:33:49** is it does let you more naturally pause in conversation. I felt like we were both

**00:33:57** more able to do the like interrupt the other person at the right moment kind of thing,

**00:34:03** because we could see physically like when I move my hands at home in my office,

**00:34:12** the Oculus is showing you how my hands are moving with like that animation.

**00:34:17** You can see which way I'm looking, I can see which way you're looking.

**00:34:21** It's funny things like, oh, I can see that your arms are crossed now. Like I can see that you

**00:34:25** have coffee in your hands. Like I can see everything that you're doing. And I think that

**00:34:30** having the full view of the upper body is kind of better than FaceTime because in FaceTime,

**00:34:34** you're often just like looking at a cropped in version of that person's face. And there's also

**00:34:40** the effect that when the person on FaceTime isn't looking at you, you can see that they're looking

**00:34:46** away. You don't know what they're looking at. But in the work rooms, if I look away or you look away,

**00:34:54** I can see that you're looking away because you're looking for a number on the presentation board

**00:35:01** that's next to us. And you can see I'm looking away because there's a virtual train moving by

**00:35:06** on the virtual window. It just makes conversation easier. You know that you're both in this virtual

**00:35:13** room, you have this shared sense of space and where people are looking and when people pause

**00:35:19** and how their body is physically posed when they pause is a big deal for making conversations more

**00:35:27** natural. And I think compared to like a FaceTime call or a Zoom call, not having that little

**00:35:33** preview of yourself is nice too. Yeah, you know what? I didn't think about that, but you're right.

**00:35:37** Yeah, I know I spend way too much time looking at the preview. I don't know what it is that makes me

**00:35:43** do it. I've heard this is a thing that a lot of people do and it has like an exhausting feeling

**00:35:48** to it. There's almost like it turns it from a call into a performance because you can see and

**00:35:53** evaluate how you look at any given time. Yeah. And having that no longer a concern is also quite nice.

**00:36:02** And also the idea that like, I mean, I don't have to be presentable in any way either because

**00:36:08** you're going to see the manicured version of the digital me. Yeah, I was going to say your virtual

**00:36:14** beard is always very nicely groomed. It's better than I could ever wish for, to be honest. It's

**00:36:19** very full, very good looking beard. One of the biggest things for me, this is something that I

**00:36:26** keep coming back to in my brain of like this idea. So like, you know, we're in this room, right? And

**00:36:31** you can customize the room and kind of make it feel like you're on a little bit and you have a

**00:36:35** few you can choose from. And the way that it would typically work is I am at a desk and you're at

**00:36:40** desk and we're across from each other. So we're looking at each other around a big desk table

**00:36:45** thing. And there is like a digital board on the wall, which can be either a whiteboard that you

**00:36:51** can stand out and draw on, or you can draw on your table in front of you. And it appears in the white

**00:36:55** board. And you can also project a computer screen like so your Mac, you can connect your Mac using

**00:37:03** software and you can then project your computer screen on the wall. It's really clever, right? Like

**00:37:09** it's just like the way you would do it in an actual conference room. And there was just this one moment

**00:37:14** where I was talking to you about some sales numbers and I pointed with my arm and you looked.

**00:37:22** That has stuck with me that moment because in that moment I was 100% in that room with you.

**00:37:30** Like that was a real feeling which didn't make any sense for me to do that. It didn't make sense for

**00:37:37** me to point because I was telling you the number anyway, but I pointed at it and you naturally

**00:37:43** looked where I was pointing and you could see what I was pointing at because I was physically

**00:37:48** to you pointing at something and you could draw a line with your eyes from where my finger was to

**00:37:55** the board. And there was just something about that moment where it was like we're not together

**00:38:00** right now. We're not in the same place. You could have been anywhere. I could have been anywhere,

**00:38:05** but because of these headsets, because of this technology, we could have an in-person meeting,

**00:38:11** which for all intents and purposes with some weirdness just felt like we were in a room together.

**00:38:16** I'm realizing that as we talk, this is one of those episodes. It has the danger of sounding like

**00:38:24** we're talking about a dream. Yes. It reminds me of how many years ago was it now? Oh,

**00:38:31** I don't even remember. It was great. We got invited to Facebook to try the VR headsets,

**00:38:37** which were still in development then. I think the episode was called Tripping on Acid or something.

**00:38:42** Yes, something like that. So for any listeners, I do apologize because I just think this is uniquely

**00:38:49** difficult to describe. And part of it is what you were saying, Mike, that it's not like playing a

**00:38:55** video game or doing a FaceTime call. Your brain really does encode this as memories of a physical

**00:39:04** place, but it's a physical place that is like a strange dream world, but that your brain also

**00:39:10** just takes 100% seriously. And so it makes relating things quite difficult. Just as a minor

**00:39:18** example, I had a funny moment of just how seriously your brain takes something is you

**00:39:23** were explaining something to me and I leaned back in my chair in my office, but in our virtual

**00:39:30** meeting room, there was a chair that was angled in front of me a little bit. And I went to put up my

**00:39:38** legs on the virtual chair, which did not exist in my physical office and fell out of my chair.

**00:39:46** Right. But it goes to show you how deadly seriously your brain takes it. I wasn't tentative

**00:39:53** about putting my legs up on this chair. I moved my legs and my weight 100% as though there was

**00:39:59** something there that would have caught me. And it didn't because it wasn't there. That's how real it

**00:40:04** feels. It feels real in ways that you don't even notice. And one thing that I do also find is a

**00:40:11** little creepy in the onboarding process that I didn't know about because I basically knew nothing

**00:40:16** about these headsets until you sent one to my house was it's like it needs to record your eyes,

**00:40:22** what your eyes are looking at, and you need to give it permission to record your face.

**00:40:28** Which is just like a little bit of an unnerving dialogue box to click yes on of like, if you're

**00:40:34** going to use this meeting room, you have to let it look at your eyes and you have to let it look at

**00:40:38** your face. And I don't like that at all. But in talking to you in this virtual room, if I couldn't

**00:40:44** see where you were looking, and you weren't making facial expressions in this like avatar

**00:40:50** representation of yourself, it would 100% change the experience to be just like barely useful.

**00:40:56** I think this is the key part of what makes the Quest Pro better is that it has these sensors in

**00:41:02** it that if we would have done these meetings with regular quests, I don't think it would have been

**00:41:07** the same experience. I don't think it would have been as good like, realistically, for me, this is

**00:41:12** so much more immersive than a zoom call, my sense of being with you my sense of feeling like this

**00:41:19** thing I was talking to was you was better than me actually seeing you, which is very strange. And

**00:41:26** it doesn't seem like that could be possible. How could me seeing cowgirl gray be better than a zoom

**00:41:37** call? Right with actual me. Yeah. And I can't explain to you why this felt better. But it did.

**00:41:43** And and I think it was just the simple idea of like, I feel like we're together in this place,

**00:41:50** we have the same surroundings in so much that I get enough from you from your voice and from

**00:41:56** your facial expressions. But then also that it is locked off to we have sharing an experience,

**00:42:02** like this experience is 100% shared, everything that I can see, you can see,

**00:42:07** it makes a big difference. And I also prefer it to assume in that you can't get distracted,

**00:42:13** I can't get distracted. Yeah, the sense of presence is different. You can see that from

**00:42:17** looking down at my computer. So you know, if I'm not paying attention to you when I'm talking to

**00:42:20** you. And she's not the same as when you're doing a video call or a voice call. There is no real

**00:42:26** sense of what someone's doing in that moment, you can guess if someone's paying attention to you,

**00:42:30** but you don't know. But in these rooms, it's a room, it's like we're in a room. Yeah, it's so

**00:42:36** simple, but it makes a difference. Here's one of my many asterisks comes in. I am afraid for remote

**00:42:44** workers, the totalitarian nightmare that this headset represents. Oh, yeah. Because you have

**00:42:50** to grant it permission to track what are you looking at in this virtual environment? I even

**00:42:56** think it's kind of horrifying that like, well, it knows if you're smiling, or if you're frowning.

**00:43:02** And so like, ah, that's data that's being collected about you. What this makes me think of a little

**00:43:07** bit is the world of truckers is kind of like the vanguard of this real monitoring of how employees

**00:43:16** are during the workday. So like, lots of truckers have to consent to systems that watch their eyes

**00:43:23** to see if they're sleepy, and like are constantly being fed back into this big data system of like

**00:43:29** exactly how is this trucker operating right now? For us, I would like to keep doing our cortex

**00:43:38** calls in VR, which I'm kind of like, there's many more disadvantages that we can talk about. And I'm

**00:43:43** kind of shocked to hear myself say that. But even after we've finished, what for me was like, oh,

**00:43:50** the reason we can do this is that we can talk about it on a show, I would actually prefer to

**00:43:54** do our next brand call in VR. We both know that we're being forced to not be distracted. And to

**00:44:03** like, put all of your brainpower into this conversation that we're having right now. It's

**00:44:08** literally a race to the outside world, it doesn't exist. And you're just in this environment to

**00:44:13** discuss like decisions about the cortex business and what are we going to do? And for you and me,

**00:44:18** self employed people who've started a company together who want it to do well. That's great.

**00:44:23** But I just think about like some of my previous jobs. And if I were forced to be in a BS meeting

**00:44:30** where I can do nothing but pay 100% attention to the total ridiculous nonsense that doesn't affect

**00:44:37** me or like, terrible decisions that are happening up front or just like information that's irrelevant.

**00:44:42** And my eyes are being tracked. And if I frown is being tracked. Like, what an unbearable nightmare

**00:44:50** that is. If I had a job where I was given the choice by my boss to commute into work and to be

**00:44:58** in the office in person, or I could work remotely and get all that time back. But while I was working

**00:45:04** remotely, I'd have to wear the headset. I also can't believe that I'm saying this out loud, but

**00:45:09** I would choose the commute. I totally would. It would just be like, work, but way too intense.

**00:45:16** And like this nightmare version of what bosses think work should be. Like you're paying 100%

**00:45:23** attention, 100% of the time to everything that's happening, which is just like an unreasonable

**00:45:28** expectation in all jobs. I mean, I would too. Because again, this is why I think one of the

**00:45:33** things is wild that I want to keep doing this. Every time that we finish one of these meetings,

**00:45:38** I get horrible headaches. The way I describe it is it feels like my brain has turned to liquid,

**00:45:44** like when we're done with these things. And I don't know what it is that's doing this. Like,

**00:45:49** I wear glasses and I wear my glasses in the headset. So I'm not sure if it's like a

**00:45:57** eyesight thing or it's an eyesight thing with a resolution thing, or if it is the headset on my

**00:46:05** head. Like I don't know what it is, but I'm usually like, I'll have these meetings and I am like out

**00:46:11** of it for a few hours afterwards because I don't feel great when I'm done. Yeah. In a way that I've

**00:46:16** not felt playing VR games. So like, I'm not really sure what it is that's causing it. I've been

**00:46:22** extremely drained after these. And I agree. It is very noticeable that it is not the same

**00:46:28** experience as VR gaming. So it's not something about the actual experience of VR or the headset.

**00:46:34** It's like, man, I can shoot a bunch of zombies with my bow and arrow for like hours and it's,

**00:46:40** and come out of it. And it's like, boy, am I pumped. That was great. I really do think it's

**00:46:44** a byproduct of the intensity that it forces you to have in paying attention. So I think that's

**00:46:50** part of it. I do think also the biggest hindrance to this actually being able to be used as a real

**00:46:57** work tool is that the resolution is not good enough for text. That might be what's giving you

**00:47:04** actual headaches. And that's where like I tried doing the thing where I load my computer

**00:47:11** into the headset to work. So you can work at like a virtual office and then load up your computer.

**00:47:16** And so like, oh, cool. I can have as big of a monitor as I want and I can put obsidian on it.

**00:47:21** I can have all the texts from my scripts and I loaded it up and I looked at it and in two seconds,

**00:47:25** I was like, Nope, this is never going to work because the text is just not crisp enough. And

**00:47:32** I think this is literally true that for text, it's the worst computer display I have ever seen,

**00:47:41** including what I was in college and worked on some of these like ancient CRT monitors that had

**00:47:47** like worse than VHS resolution output. Yeah. Cause the text you were seeing on those was made for

**00:47:52** those. The text that we're trying to read from our computer screens, like, and I'm not excusing it

**00:47:57** here, but like these screens do not have the resolution required to make that look good.

**00:48:03** Like they just don't. But there's an additional problem, which is that bad resolution text on a

**00:48:09** bad monitor in the real world is still a flat object that you're looking at with your two eyes.

**00:48:16** Whereas in VR, the headset is generating two slightly different images to give you the

**00:48:22** illusion of 3d. And for absolutely everything, if those two images aren't like perfectly created

**00:48:30** or your headset isn't perfectly sitting, it's going to be like ever so slightly out of focus,

**00:48:36** but you won't even notice, which is why I think like for any of the gaming stuff,

**00:48:40** there's never even comes up. Like I never think about it, but the text is intrinsically blurrier

**00:48:46** because if the 3d effect is an absolutely perfect, which I just think they can't do right now,

**00:48:53** it just looks bad. And I think your brain is trying to focus on it all the time.

**00:48:58** This might be the difference between me and you where like, because I'm running the meeting

**00:49:03** and I have all the notes, like I'm looking at a computer inside of the horizon work room for

**00:49:07** most of it. I'm doing a lot more reading to like pull up this and I'm looking through these charts

**00:49:12** and looking at this and like, here's my next item on the list. So maybe that's causing me some focus

**00:49:18** issues, which is straining my eyes. And I think you're also having to do the thing of switching

**00:49:22** more, which is that you're going more from looking at text to looking at me to looking outside to

**00:49:27** looking at text. Whereas for me, I'm looking at you. I can see that you have this little

**00:49:32** computer in front of you, but I can't see what's on there. I just see what you're choosing to

**00:49:37** project on the virtual wall, which is also much bigger than the display that you are looking at,

**00:49:41** which helps with the text size, which is also why if you ever play a VR game, you'll notice that the

**00:49:47** text is enormous, right? If they ever need to show you something written, like the game tries to make

**00:49:52** it as big as it possibly can because it just looks better that way, but actual work documents

**00:49:58** don't get to have size 72 font letters because like a meeting agenda just needs to be smaller

**00:50:05** than that. So I think this is the biggest impediment to it actually being a useful work tool is

**00:50:11** the resolution is just bad for text. The resolution is great for a virtual environment. Like your

**00:50:16** brain doesn't care, but I think they are miles away from text that looks like text on a retina

**00:50:23** computer screen. And I think they're going to need to be at some kind of much higher than we would

**00:50:30** expect resolution in both eyes to make that work. So even if people talk about like, Oh, it's going

**00:50:36** to be a 4k display in both eyes. It's like, I'm sure that will look great. But I also think that

**00:50:42** probably won't improve text as much as you actually need it to because of the stereoscopic

**00:50:48** effect and the need for it to be just like perfectly focused in order to work. But that's

**00:50:54** also why I kind of can imagine this as just like an absolute nightmare for a remote worker to be

**00:50:59** like, Oh, work on your documents in VR. So we can keep track of exactly what you're doing at all

**00:51:05** times down to the level of, are you actually looking at the document that you're supposed

**00:51:10** to be working on? Or are you paying attention to some other notes on your screen? I would suggest

**00:51:14** that if anybody listening, if their employer ever suggested them about using a VR headset,

**00:51:20** bring up very fast that you have VR motion sickness. Just be like, Oh, I've tried beat

**00:51:27** saber and I've like, I threw up all over my room immediately. Like I genuinely think this needs to

**00:51:32** be a like, Hey, workers of the world, you should probably unite on this front of like, you all have

**00:51:37** VR motion sickness. Like I just think that might be quite good to do. I do want to mention hand

**00:51:42** tracking. They got to do better. There's a lot of things where they would prefer you to use your

**00:51:47** hands and sometimes it works okay. But most of the time it does not work very well. Like when you're

**00:51:54** using hand tracking, they have this like gesture they want you to perform. So you can bring up a

**00:51:58** menu where you pinch your fingers together to bring up a menu. It works maybe 25% of the time.

**00:52:03** Yeah. Hand tracking really needs to come a long way to be doing this stuff. These meetings,

**00:52:11** particularly want to be using a controller. Yeah, the controller is a bit awkward. And

**00:52:16** if we're doing things like where I talk about like my, my transcending moment was a point,

**00:52:20** right? And it did a good job of getting that, but it doesn't all the time. Sometimes we're talking

**00:52:27** and your arm disappears behind the back of your head for no reason. All of a sudden,

**00:52:32** it is nowhere near as good at doing, I think a representative job as hand tracking as it is like

**00:52:38** facial expression tracking, which feels very good. Like I never see your face do something

**00:52:44** bananas, right? Like your eyes don't fly out of the back of your head at any point or anything,

**00:52:48** you know? Yeah, the hands can be all over the place. And I think I really don't help that

**00:52:53** because using this kind of thing will make you quite self-conscious of how you are in meetings.

**00:52:58** And I think I never quite realized how often I put my hands on the top of my head when I'm

**00:53:02** listening. And it's like, oh, there's no cameras up there. So the headset is like, where does hands

**00:53:08** go? I have no idea. Make him fold his arms in front of him. And like, I can see that sometimes.

**00:53:14** It's like my VR arms just did something different because I put my actual hands on the top of my

**00:53:19** head while I'm listening to you talk. But the headset has lost track of them. And it's not great

**00:53:25** again for any any kind of my hands are in front of me and I'm gesturing. Like I feel like it does

**00:53:31** fairly well nail that. But the moment you start going to the edges or especially above the the

**00:53:37** hands can be all over the place. Well, I do think it lacks some precision though. Yeah. This is also

**00:53:42** where I think there's some kinds of things that are just a little bit embarrassing. And the gesture

**00:53:48** where you touch your index finger to your thumb to try to bring up a menu, that seems like such

**00:53:53** a simple gesture. And the number of times it fails to register is like, oh, that is real bad.

**00:54:00** Like it's like the one thing you're telling me to do. So you really should have this one taken care

**00:54:06** of, you know? Yeah, it's literally the only gesture is to touch my finger to my thumb. And

**00:54:11** what's very strange about it is like, I can see that my virtual hand has done it. Yes. Like,

**00:54:16** you know, my index finger is touching my thumb. Where's the menu? You don't bring up the little

**00:54:21** menu. Yeah. I don't know what's going on there. It's like there's two systems that aren't talking

**00:54:25** to each other or is trying to use some different kind of recognition to bring up the menu. I don't

**00:54:30** know. It's odd. Sometimes it feels like, like, you know, when you're like pointing or something

**00:54:33** and pinching, it feels like there's like a weird lag to it sometimes where like I'm doing it and

**00:54:38** my hand will come and join me in a second. It's very strange. Like the hand tracking does feel

**00:54:43** incredibly complicated to do. So like, I'm not surprised that it is something that

**00:54:49** requires more work over time. Yeah. But it is something that it's one of the only things that

**00:54:56** I'm doing that's pulling me out of the experience while I'm in it. Yeah. And I do think they have

**00:55:01** the disadvantage of being caught in the middle of some things you need to use controllers for,

**00:55:08** some things you need to use your hands for, which then also means the system has to guess very fast

**00:55:15** which one of these two input methods are you using. And so there can be this lag of, oh, I've

**00:55:20** picked up the controller, but it hasn't recognized it for a second or the reverse of that. I've put

**00:55:25** the controller down on my desk and now I've lifted my hand up and my virtual hand just stays on the

**00:55:31** desk for a few moments until it realizes, oh no, he's, he's let go of that. I think that is really

**00:55:36** hard. Like the ideal for what they want. Again, if you want like normal people in meetings to just

**00:55:42** use this, it has to be a controller free experience. Like these controllers just have to go,

**00:55:47** but it isn't there yet to be able to actually just use it entirely without controllers.

**00:55:54** This episode of Cortex is brought to you by SetApp. Of all the tools available to us these days,

**00:55:59** looking for something new to improve the way we work can feel like drowning in an ocean of

**00:56:03** different apps and services. There are just so many available on the market right now,

**00:56:08** and not all of them are worth your time and money. And what's more, so many of us are paying

**00:56:12** for apps and services that have never properly integrated into our workflows. So how do you know

**00:56:18** which are worth trying without emptying your wallet and subscriptions that you're probably

**00:56:22** going to forget to cancel in the future? The answer is SetApp. SetApp is a platform that combines more

**00:58:31** As you know, Gray, I'm abreast of the rumors, right? Yeah, I'm all over it. Apple rumors. You are

**00:58:39** literally my only source for Apple rumors. So as far as I'm concerned, you are where all the rumors

**00:58:44** come from. So as we are recording this, Apple have announced nothing, and we're expecting something

**00:58:50** later on this year from them. So I hear from you. So you hear from me, you're about to hear from me.

**00:58:54** You know, we're maybe at this point, a few months away from an unveiling, maybe nine months away

**00:58:59** from a shipping product. The things that we are talking about that we want to see improved are,

**00:59:06** as of this moment, the things that it seems Apple are most focusing on. So one of them is

**00:59:14** avatar creation. So the rumors are suggesting in a one on one, they're going to do this like

**00:59:20** really high quality avatar, which is going to be very intensive and seems like probably,

**00:59:27** unfortunately for you, they're going to try and make something as realistic as possible.

**00:59:31** What do you mean by intensive? What does that what do you mean by?

**00:59:34** Processor intensive. Oh, okay. So just like high resolution,

**00:59:37** very high resolution, because in any meeting environment where it's more than two people,

**00:59:42** it's going to revert to emoji. I'm surprised. The rumor is that they're doing something more

**00:59:46** than emoji because I was surprised about that too, is that you have the perfect system. Why

**00:59:50** would you do something else? But I think they are Apple are going high end with this product,

**00:59:56** right? The rumors are it's probably going to be like $3,000 and Apple's going to make no profit

**01:00:00** on that, right? Like they are going heavy now to build the platform for when it can be cheaper

**01:00:07** later, but they're going to go heavy, high power, high performance with the first instance. I don't

**01:00:15** know why they're attempting to go that route. My hope is that they will show us things that are so

**01:00:20** mind blowing and that's the reason that they got to go expensive. Right? And so the,

**01:00:26** the expectation is these will have basically Mac chips in them. And so they in doing that,

**01:00:32** they want to create this very realistic feeling experience as a way to wow people.

**01:00:40** I think for me, what I'm looking for from the headset, I want them to be able to produce

**01:00:48** an event which provides similar shock and awe to the original iPhone. Oh yeah. I mean,

**01:00:55** of course that's what you'd want, but I did not feel like this with the Apple watch.

**01:01:01** Right. But I think if they want to really make this seem like it's going to be a big deal,

**01:01:07** they need to be able to shock us. I don't believe they will get to that level, but if they're able

**01:01:12** to do things like automatically create a realistic avatar for you that looks like you in the,

**01:01:19** it's like, you know, like, wow, you know, like that's the kind of thing I think they're going

**01:01:23** for here with that kind of stuff. So they're going for maybe more realism. Yeah. And to be fair,

**01:01:28** if there was an automatic avatar creation process, I would probably be significantly

**01:01:33** less resistant to that. Good point. It's a little bit of like, I hate that. I have to pick which

**01:01:38** nose is mine. Right. That's awful. I hate it. And I actually think one of the things about

**01:01:44** me emoji is like the cartooniness of it actually made it easier. Like that experience is nicer in

**01:01:50** that way. Cause it isn't so like I'm trying to make me. Yeah. It can't possibly be you. It's the

**01:01:58** cartoon version of you. Again, like I just think of Pixar. It's like if it was a Pixar created

**01:02:04** version of you, no one expects it to really look like you. It's supposed to capture the idea of

**01:02:08** you. They're apparently, you know, we're talking about the resolution. So they go in all in on

**01:02:13** screens, eight K screens in each eye is one of the rumors. Yeah. That's going to be very expensive.

**01:02:19** And then apparently they have no controller. It's all hand tracking. I think that's what it's got

**01:02:24** to be. So here's what I'll say. I think for certain use cases, I agree with you, right? Like

**01:02:31** that is what it's got to be like for work, for the things that we're talking about here, me and

**01:02:34** you sitting down in a meeting environment. What I want is the very best hand tracking that money

**01:02:40** can provide. Right. That that would be great, but not for games though. Yeah. I know. I completely

**01:02:45** agree. Like this whole conversation hasn't been games for like explicitly from the top. But like

**01:02:50** if we're talking about me and you here sitting down and having a meeting, then yes. Right. Like

**01:02:56** I want great hand tracking. I want great comfort, which apparently they're going for one of the

**01:03:00** things that they've done, which on the face of it sounds not great, was apparently the battery

**01:03:07** is not in the headset. There is a cable from the headset to a battery pack that you put in your

**01:03:12** pocket or something. I don't think that's the worst idea though. I mean, when I heard it, I was like,

**01:03:17** well, my expectation is all of the reasons they've done this are things that I want, which is I want

**01:03:22** it to feel more comfortable in my head and last longer. That's something we didn't talk about with

**01:03:25** the Quest Pro. The battery life is terrible. It's so bad. It's like two hours or something.

**01:03:31** Like it's, you know, it's just not great, you know, using this thing for any kind of intensive thing

**01:03:36** and the battery started to go. I would not want to be in a meeting in the Quest Pro for one minute

**01:03:41** more than two hours, but yeah, it's got to last longer. It's still not great. It's not great because

**01:03:47** again, I think in Meta's ideal world, people would be doing several meetings a day in this. And it's

**01:03:52** like, it can't, the battery can't hold up to that. It can't charge fast enough.

**01:03:55** It's like, it's great that I have this fancy charging dock, but oh boy, do I need it, right?

**01:03:59** Because it's in there all the time, this thing. So there were some potential rumors, which I would

**01:04:04** like is that the battery, you could then swap out for another battery. You could just like plug in

**01:04:08** a new battery. So you can have a couple go in if you wanted to have a really long session. So,

**01:04:13** I mean, I'm choosing to stay like positive about this. And I will say one of the things that has

**01:04:20** changed my mind about Apple's headset is my experiences with the Meta Quest Pro with you.

**01:04:27** Now I'm like, yeah, I could use this as a work tool. I could do this. You know,

**01:04:33** like I think about recording podcasts in VR. Like what could that be like? Yeah. Would that feel

**01:04:41** better in a way? We don't have to do video, but we could actually feel like we're in the same place.

**01:04:47** Would it help with you knowing when I've got something to say that kind of thing? Like that

**01:04:52** could be really interesting. Yeah. I hadn't thought about that with video podcasts, because

**01:04:59** do pull back the curtain. There's a thing if you are recording a podcast and like we are,

**01:05:04** you're willing to put in a bunch of actual editing effort to make it happen that we both do where

**01:05:10** you sometimes talk over each other, but we've both learned to finish our own sentences as we're

**01:05:17** simultaneously talking over the other person because we know like you can fix that in editing

**01:05:23** and just pull the two sentences apart. All the best sentence wins. Yeah. But that is a byproduct

**01:05:29** of not having the visual cue of when the person is going to talk. And I just don't think that

**01:05:37** FaceTime is actually like for all the reasons we discussed before, I think if we recorded a

**01:05:41** podcast using FaceTime, it's more of a hindrance than a help. Yeah. But it is conceivable that a VR

**01:05:48** podcast could help there. And even again, if you're being professionals about recording something,

**01:05:55** you could just have a little hand signal. It's like, Oh, when I put my finger up, like I have

**01:05:58** something that I want to say, but I don't want to interrupt you. Like you can have that kind of

**01:06:02** stuff in real life that could make an editing effort easier that I hadn't really thought about.

**01:06:08** But I didn't realize like, so you were, you were just like not positive on VR as a, as like a

**01:06:16** future product really until you tried this. Like what's your position that's changed since using

**01:06:21** the Oculus or the meta or whatever the quest very into it for gaming, right? Like I think

**01:06:28** great gaming experiences. And I would actually say great gaming experiences more than great

**01:06:34** games. I have yet to encounter personally a VR game that felt like a full video game, you know,

**01:06:41** and like I've played a bunch of things that I've purported to be that kind of thing, but it still

**01:06:47** feels like there is a novelness to it that I don't experience in other regular console games.

**01:06:54** But I do believe that's coming as we move further and further down the line.

**01:06:59** PlayStation just released their PS VR to, I believe we will see more and more full video games in VR,

**01:07:05** but I've yet to really have that kind of experience where this meeting has had actual

**01:07:13** real benefit to it over what I was doing otherwise, where for me, the video gaming aspect of my

**01:07:22** quest experiences, like this is a nice way to play this game, but it's not necessarily better

**01:07:27** than any other game that I would play on any other console. It's different. And I enjoy the

**01:07:34** feeling in the world, but also sometimes there are some games where like I could play them on

**01:07:39** a console and enjoy them, but too intense for me in VR, right? So like it can detract as well as

**01:07:46** enhance an experience. But like, I'm not like in the meeting, I'm not getting scared of you.

**01:07:52** Like it's only adding for me to that experience. I mean, that's not technically true because we

**01:07:59** did discover that you can teleport into different seats and surprised each other a couple of times,

**01:08:04** but you know, that ends very, but it's not so intense as like a dragon chasing me, you know,

**01:08:09** like, and I did, I did keep getting, you didn't get them, but I, whenever I loaded into the VR

**01:08:14** space, it gave me this warning of like, Hey, you better respect people's personal space in here,

**01:08:18** which I found very, like, very funny as a warning, but I can also get it that in VR,

**01:08:24** like if you get right up in someone's face, like it does feel like someone's right up in your face.

**01:08:28** Can be a little disconcerting, but for me, the experiences that we've had of like, Oh,

**01:08:33** I could actually understand using this in my professional life, which then it becomes more

**01:08:39** than novelty, like the novelty can still be there, but I can also use this professionally.

**01:08:45** And then if I can use it professionally, maybe one day, it could be used for more like talking

**01:08:51** with friends kinds of experiences rather than just being like a professional thing. Because

**01:08:58** what I was concerned about for Apple is all of the rumors suggesting the price $3,000, right?

**01:09:05** Is this expected price is number that keeps getting thrown around. And it's like, well,

**01:09:09** that's too much money, right? Like you are not going to sell enough of these is too expensive.

**01:09:15** It's more expensive than the max. Most of the max, like it's very, very high. But if they're doing

**01:09:22** this because they can offer an experience, which in all of the professional realms here that we're

**01:09:27** talking about is better than what mentor can do, then maybe it's a decent place to start.

**01:09:33** Yeah, I've thought many times while we're having those meetings, that it's useful for us. But if,

**01:09:40** let's say we worked in computer graphics or anything that had CAD, like architecture software,

**01:09:47** you know, you've seen videos, right? Or like movies where people are discussing a physical

**01:09:53** object in a virtual space. Like we've all seen this in movies, but having done the actual meeting,

**01:09:59** it was like, Oh my God, if I was an architect, 100%, this would be incredibly useful. If we can

**01:10:05** bring physical objects into this space. It was like, if I'm designing a video game and I'm like

**01:10:11** having meetings with developers around the world, and we need to talk about like models for

**01:10:16** characters. It was immediate, like this is a no brainer. We should do it in this environment.

**01:10:22** I mean, who knows what Apple's going to do with their initial product, but I could see that they

**01:10:26** have something that's very high end, but they're also trying to target a particular market. And I

**01:10:33** always thought Apple does seem to be going after the entertainment industry in interesting ways

**01:10:37** with some of their production stuff behind the scenes. And it's like, I could see this fitting

**01:10:42** in very well for like people who are having meetings about special effects in movies. I could

**01:10:48** see that. I think ultimately the place that they're going to start is this is for some high end

**01:10:56** customers, customers that are going to pay this money, right? It's going to be for professional

**01:11:01** customers who are going to want this for the enhanced FaceTime experience that they'll get

**01:11:07** out of this. And it's for developers who are going to start crafting the apps and experiences

**01:11:13** that will then be ready for when in three years time we have a $1,000 version of this product.

**01:11:20** And then we're ready. My co-host and upgrade Jason Snell keeps talking about this. And I

**01:11:24** hope that he's right that when they announced this product, they talk openly about this is

**01:11:29** the beginning of a line of products that we will produce. So they contextualize that like

**01:11:35** the Apple headset is not always going to be a $3,000 product every single year, right? That is a

**01:11:42** start, but they've chosen to start in this place because they want to show what they believe

**01:11:46** they'll be able to offer to everyone for a third of the price in an amount of time from the future.

**01:11:52** But they have to start somewhere. And I do believe they just need to get going with this,

**01:11:57** because if they believe this is important to them, Meta will just take the market. Yeah.

**01:12:04** So like if they want to do it, they've got to get in and they've just got to get going,

**01:12:08** no matter what their headlines are going to say, right? Apple charging $3,000 for their headset,

**01:12:16** you know, Meta charges $500 for their headset. Like, you know, it's going to be bad press,

**01:12:22** because that's just what it's going to be if this is the product that they offer.

**01:12:26** But I understand why you might start here. If you believe this is the beginning of a

**01:12:32** thing, you know, it's worth remembering when the iPhone came out, the idea of an $800 phone

**01:12:38** on a contract was ridiculous, but they just pushed it forward and people went in on it because it

**01:12:44** was so impressive. So that's the kind of thing they got to hope that they can do, right?

**01:12:49** Ultimately, the thing that surprised me about this whole experience, and we decided we were

**01:12:53** going to do this episode, it was going to be more of like, ha ha, how fun is the Metaverse?

**01:13:00** Yeah. How silly all these game experiences are. But it quite quickly changed when we had a couple

**01:13:06** of these meetings. And then it was like, Oh, no, wait, we're believers in this technology now.

**01:13:11** Yeah, we both expected that we were going to spend a bunch of money on these headsets.

**01:13:17** And it might be an entertaining disaster. We have both been surprised that for all of the

**01:13:24** complaints, Meta has proved there's something here. Like there is something here in terms of a useful

**01:13:32** tool. Like they're going to keep iterating on it. And someone is going to win this space.

**01:13:40** How big is this market? I don't know. But I've, I've felt like, and ever since we had that very

**01:13:45** first demo at Facebook headquarters, that was for me the experience of a new medium for the first

**01:13:53** time. And it's like, oh, there's, there's plays, and then there's radio, and then there's television,

**01:13:58** this is amazing. It's a new medium. And VR for me was like, I cannot believe this is a new medium.

**01:14:04** And I still really enjoy gaming in VR in that as that like new medium experience.

**01:14:12** But this is something else on top of that now of like, it's not just entertainment. There is a

**01:14:18** useful tool here. It may be in the most baby form, but there's something here and someone is going

**01:14:28** to be the winner in this market.
