# Cortex - 107: A Visual Bombardment
**00:00:00** Oh, I should probably open the show notes. That would be helpful.

**00:00:03** Oh my god, this Google Docs is blindingly white.

**00:00:08** But the first thing in the show notes is Google Docs has a dark mode somewhere.

**00:00:12** Google Docs dark mode.

**00:00:16** Where are you?

**00:00:17** If I was dark mode, where would I hide?

**00:00:22** Oh, are you looking for it in the web browser?

**00:00:24** Yeah.

**00:00:24** You're not going to find it there.

**00:00:26** What do you mean I'm not going to find it there?

**00:00:27** Because it doesn't exist yet.

**00:00:29** You say there's dark dark mode in Google Docs.

**00:00:31** It says it right here on iOS.

**00:00:33** There is dark mode on iOS. OK.

**00:00:36** I'm not 100 percent sure why they are so slowly rolling this out.

**00:00:42** But I'll tell you now, great.

**00:00:44** Google Docs in dark mode.

**00:00:45** Yeah, great.

**00:00:47** It looks weird like.

**00:00:49** So I'll say it's way better in docs in sheets.

**00:00:53** It doesn't work so well.

**00:00:54** The colors are all wrong.

**00:00:56** OK, so like if you use Google Sheets for anything in your coloring cells or rows

**00:01:00** like I do, it just doesn't work when you flick from white to dark.

**00:01:05** Like, really, you have to rebuild all the colors again and stick to one or the other.

**00:01:10** Right. But I think Google is aware of this

**00:01:12** because they have a per document toggle.

**00:01:17** That's not a bad idea for a spreadsheet.

**00:01:19** No, and it was not a bad idea.

**00:01:21** I now have everything in dark mode.

**00:01:24** And when I need to see something in light mode, I just turn it on or off again,

**00:01:28** which at least I have dark mode now is an option that is available to me.

**00:01:32** I like looking at Google Docs in dark mode, but I would also really love it

**00:01:36** on my Mac, because right now, I have five windows open in front of me.

**00:01:41** Right. And all but two of them are dark.

**00:01:45** The one that is light is like a light gray and it's tiny.

**00:01:49** It's the core recorder window, which I don't care about.

**00:01:52** The only one of them which has taken up any significant space is Safari

**00:01:56** and it is blindingly white, but full of Google Docs.

**00:02:01** Well, let me let me recommend a Safari extension to you.

**00:02:04** I like dark reader for the dark mode.

**00:02:07** That's what I'm using to like force Google Docs to not be bright and into my eyeballs.

**00:02:11** Dark reader. Is it?

**00:02:13** How does this work, though?

**00:02:14** I don't like this website. It's weird looking.

**00:02:17** How does this work? Dark reader for Safari.

**00:02:19** What do you mean? How does it work?

**00:02:20** It makes the page dark.

**00:02:22** No, but like will it do it for every website?

**00:02:25** So you OK, I like dark reader for two reasons.

**00:02:29** It does have an individual toggle so you can say, yes, Google Docs.

**00:02:34** No, my bank, right?

**00:02:35** Like that kind of thing.

**00:02:36** So you can uncheck it on your bank website and then it won't ever run.

**00:02:39** And then what I also really like, which is different from all of the other plugins

**00:02:43** I've tried, is it has a couple of different modes that it tries to make the page dark.

**00:02:50** So you know how like on some pages, the first guess about how should this page

**00:02:54** look good in dark mode might not be right.

**00:02:56** So you can go in and say like this mode doesn't work.

**00:02:59** Try the other mode and then have it remember like which darkification works

**00:03:03** better for which website. So I like it.

**00:03:05** It gives a couple of options and it makes Google Docs

**00:03:09** able to be looked at as well on my screen where everything is dark.

**00:03:12** And I'm like, I'm not I'm not going to sit here for two hours recording a podcast

**00:03:17** with a white piece of paper in front of me the whole time blasting into my eyeballs.

**00:03:21** Like no way. So dark reader is is my recommendation.

**00:03:24** I've tried a bunch of these and I like to agree to the best.

**00:03:26** I mean, I haven't I've installed it right now.

**00:03:28** OK, but so here's the thing that I want, though.

**00:03:31** I want it to just opt into some websites and not everything.

**00:03:36** And I don't think I can.

**00:03:37** I don't think it does that right.

**00:03:38** I have to turn it on and then opt stuff out like that's all. OK.

**00:03:43** Yeah, you just leave it on and you opt stuff out

**00:03:45** as you don't want to use that stuff.

**00:03:47** Yeah, see, I don't know if that's what I want.

**00:03:49** Now give it a try. It'll be fine.

**00:03:50** Look, what you'll discover very fast is you forget that it's even there

**00:03:53** for most places and you're going to run into like an 80 20 principle real fast.

**00:03:57** I like the couple of places that you don't want to have dark mode,

**00:03:59** like always bank websites or whatever.

**00:04:02** There's not actually a lot of them.

**00:04:03** So you just uncheck a couple of them and you saw like 80 percent of your problem

**00:04:09** of I don't want this to be in dark mode with just a handful of websites.

**00:04:13** Give it a try. Yeah, I'm sure I'm going to try.

**00:04:16** I'm going to try out.

**00:04:17** I'm already like I'm just flicking between my tabs and I'm seeing some

**00:04:21** and I'm turning them off for those websites.

**00:04:22** OK, I can I can I'm happy to try this out for a while.

**00:04:26** But what it has done is made the Google Docs window darker

**00:04:29** and I've changed some of the contrast and I think I'm happy with this.

**00:04:34** Yeah, we all know light mode, light mode is the worst.

**00:04:37** The dark side is cool and the light side is dumb.

**00:04:42** Well, let me tell you something that is funny, though, both sheets

**00:04:45** and docs, they look exactly color wise how they look on IOS.

**00:04:50** So whatever Google is doing is exactly the same as what this developer is doing,

**00:04:55** which is annoying me even more because it's proving the point

**00:04:58** that Google didn't really spend a ton of time on this.

**00:05:02** No, I imagine I imagine that I've always been really terrible

**00:05:06** as like a color designer.

**00:05:07** I'm very aware this this is one particular weakness of mine.

**00:05:11** Is that like I'm very bad at selecting colors that go well together.

**00:05:14** But I'm very certain looking at light versus dark mode stuff

**00:05:18** that there's just way fewer options with dark mode

**00:05:22** of how to make things look good that way.

**00:05:24** Yes, definitely.

**00:05:26** And so that also makes me just wonder when companies are rolling out dark mode

**00:05:29** like, hey, guys, you don't have an infinite rainbow of palettes to choose from here.

**00:05:36** Right. Is like you've got two or three dark backgrounds to pick from

**00:05:41** that range from dark gray to darker gray and black.

**00:05:46** And then on those, you have a very small handful of colors that look OK.

**00:05:50** Like you shouldn't be investing three members of staff

**00:05:54** and six months into picking your dark mode colors.

**00:05:57** Like it's just it's a much, much more confined range.

**00:06:01** But also, if you're going to do a really good job

**00:06:06** and some companies have done better jobs than others.

**00:06:10** You know what's really annoying?

**00:06:11** This is so I'm so upset about this.

**00:06:13** Google Sheets, they automatically direct to docs, Google dot com.

**00:06:18** So I can't have sheets always white.

**00:06:21** Docs always dark with this. Right.

**00:06:25** We'll see. We'll see how this goes.

**00:06:27** But for the rest of the episode, I will be using this dark reader thing.

**00:06:31** I like that I could get it from the app store. That's cool.

**00:06:34** I like that. Yeah.

**00:06:35** Like, I don't know how much of an additional layer of security that is,

**00:06:38** but it particularly for installing stuff in the browser.

**00:06:41** I don't like browser extensions.

**00:06:43** So I'm happy to have at least had a little bit more peace of mind

**00:06:48** in getting it through the app store.

**00:06:49** Yeah. Installing a browser extension from a random website

**00:06:52** just feels like asking to get hacked. Yeah.

**00:06:57** I wanted to follow up on the podcast of Thangrai.

**00:06:59** How did it go? It was a fantastic success.

**00:07:02** We hosted the event for seven hours in total.

**00:07:05** So this was our charity fundraiser for St. Jude Children's Cancer Research Hospital.

**00:07:09** I would say that content level, I think we did a vastly better job

**00:07:13** than the previous podcast.

**00:07:15** I actually think it was more entertaining, which, you know,

**00:07:18** that came from just having done it once and that kind of stuff.

**00:07:21** Technically, we pulled it off.

**00:07:23** Wasn't perfect.

**00:07:24** But again, it's one of those things I kind of learned for next time.

**00:07:27** There's something that I realized is video conferencing software

**00:07:30** tends not to like seven hours of constant connection.

**00:07:34** And towards the end, my like audio and video was out of sync.

**00:07:38** And I wasn't aware of it.

**00:07:39** So like if I would have maybe just quit Discord and reopened it again,

**00:07:42** I maybe would have been able to make my end look a little bit better towards the end.

**00:07:46** But as Steven put, because, you know, you know, when I'm sure

**00:07:50** you can sympathize with this, like you work really hard at something

**00:07:53** and then something small happens like that, really.

**00:07:57** And and you end up feeling like deflated from it because it's like, oh, yeah.

**00:08:00** Right. Because it wasn't quite and quite perfect.

**00:08:02** But as Steven very rightly put to me, it clearly didn't harm anything

**00:08:06** because we got the job done because during the podcast itself,

**00:08:10** we raised enough money to meet our three hundred and fifteen thousand dollar

**00:08:13** goal for the month. Sweet. That's amazing.

**00:08:16** So we ended up going for an extra hour because we were getting so close

**00:08:20** that we decided to push it for another hour to meet that goal.

**00:08:24** And overall, in the month of September, Relay FM and the community

**00:08:28** raised four hundred and fifty six thousand dollars for St.

**00:08:31** Oh, which is when I said that then I got like a little shiver in my spine.

**00:08:37** So, yeah, we we've absolutely smashed it.

**00:08:40** And so it was such a such a proud moment to have hit that those kinds of figures.

**00:08:47** So between both years now, we've raised seven hundred and seventy one thousand

**00:08:52** dollars. So we'll go for a million next year, I guess.

**00:08:55** Total raised over those three years.

**00:08:57** Yeah. So proud of this.

**00:09:00** We had no idea what it was going to be like going into it, you know,

**00:09:02** not just the podcast itself, but the fundraising, right?

**00:09:05** Because the the landscape of the globe is very different to what it was a year

**00:09:09** before. Yeah. Yeah.

**00:09:11** And to see the kind of support that we got for this incredible charity this year

**00:09:16** was really very, very amazing, very special.

**00:09:20** If you want to catch the podcast, it's all on YouTube so you can go and watch it.

**00:09:24** If you want to, I'll put it in the show notes.

**00:09:25** Yeah, really, really thrilled.

**00:09:27** That's an amazing response from everyone because, yeah, I was I was a little bit

**00:09:31** worried because of like the global situation this year.

**00:09:35** And I didn't know what the final number was until now.

**00:09:38** And and four hundred and fifty six thousand dollars is a money.

**00:09:46** Look, you have one hundred thousand here, one hundred thousand there.

**00:09:49** It starts it starts turning into real money real fast.

**00:09:51** So, yeah, that's that's incredibly impressive.

**00:09:54** And I think a lot of people were tuning in for the balloon room for sure.

**00:09:58** Balloon room was a big success, man.

**00:10:00** Even my own father who listened to Cortex was like, Mike's going to be in a balloon

**00:10:04** room. Where can I see this thing?

**00:10:06** Yes, I will say balloon room was successful.

**00:10:10** People like it.

**00:10:12** I took a bunch of like Instagram stories and put them into a little collection.

**00:10:16** And so I'll put those in the show notes as well, which includes stuff of filling

**00:10:20** the balloons and then also my favorite thing,

**00:10:23** which was popping them gray.

**00:10:26** I had so much fun doing that.

**00:10:29** Like it was I will say it was like this maybe sounds a little dramatic,

**00:10:34** but like it was me. It's like a dream realized to do this because I've wanted

**00:10:37** to do this for ages to be in this room and it was like slowly

**00:10:40** falling up with balloons around me and I was walking around and I could hide in

**00:10:44** them, which was fun.

**00:10:45** You got a lot of balloons in there.

**00:10:46** It was a lot of balloons.

**00:10:47** And I was like, this is this is a bunch of balloons.

**00:10:49** I think we put like six or seven hundred in there.

**00:10:52** Oh, and like I would come back from the video and I'd be like hidden

**00:10:57** and I could just like appear from the balloons.

**00:11:00** The popping them was brilliant.

**00:11:01** Like I got like a tube that a poster comes in post a tube.

**00:11:04** Yeah. And we just got some electrical tape and stuck some sewing needles

**00:11:09** on the end of it.

**00:11:10** So there was like just three sewing needles poking out.

**00:11:12** OK. And I was just like running around in there just popping these things.

**00:11:16** It was fantastic.

**00:11:17** So, yeah, I would say absolute success.

**00:11:20** Everything went perfectly well.

**00:11:21** The balloon room was better than I thought.

**00:11:23** And even the cleanup was fun.

**00:11:24** So and then along the way, we raised nearly half a million dollars.

**00:11:28** So, you know, pretty great.

**00:11:30** Yeah, that's that's really amazing.

**00:11:32** That's really amazing.

**00:11:34** On the last episode, you put out a quest to the cortex.

**00:11:37** And no, don't ask me.

**00:11:39** Don't ask me this now, Mike.

**00:11:40** OK, so when is the problem?

**00:11:43** OK, OK, so look, I know you're going to bring up the mask thing.

**00:11:46** I felt like, OK, great.

**00:11:48** Gray asked everybody for a mask.

**00:11:50** And I'm like, I'm so sorry to do this to everyone.

**00:11:53** So, you know, talk about community responses being great. Right.

**00:11:57** There were also a ton of mask suggestions from people,

**00:12:00** which is totally the same as raising half a million dollars for children's cancer.

**00:12:05** I wasn't really thinking of it like this for sure.

**00:12:08** I get what you're saying.

**00:12:09** We've moved on. We're into the next segment.

**00:12:12** You know, yeah, this is the transition.

**00:12:14** I played a little diddling sound.

**00:12:16** Oh, it's like it's everyone knows that the way that the time looks

**00:12:20** wants to be the link sounds.

**00:12:21** It could have been 20 seconds or two hours in between those two things.

**00:12:24** So it's yeah, no one knows.

**00:12:26** The problem is when we're recording, I don't hear the little sound.

**00:12:30** Would you like me to to do it?

**00:12:32** Yeah. If you think it's going to be the little sound,

**00:12:34** why don't you just go for it in the recording?

**00:12:36** That would be something I would enjoy is you can just go for it.

**00:12:40** OK, when you think it's time.

**00:12:42** But I'll just throw those at you all the time.

**00:12:47** But yeah, so I realized in getting ready for today's episode,

**00:12:52** I was like, everybody participated in.

**00:12:54** Let's have a lot of mask suggestions for gray.

**00:12:57** And they're probably going to want to know the answer to which mask

**00:13:01** and gray like the best.

**00:13:03** And I think I bought them all like I bought all of the masks

**00:13:08** that people suggested.

**00:13:09** That's the only way you could have known.

**00:13:11** Yeah. OK, so here's the thing.

**00:13:12** I did find one that I really like.

**00:13:15** But the problem is the mask does not on its list.

**00:13:19** The manufacturer I was going through.

**00:13:21** This is useless what you were doing.

**00:13:24** No, no, no, you just let me finish.

**00:13:28** OK, so listen, so I was going through the Reddit and I was like,

**00:13:32** well, I'll just find it's surely the one I like is definitely top

**00:13:35** voted in this thread.

**00:13:37** I was going through and opening the links and like,

**00:13:39** I can't figure out which of these masks is the one that I bought.

**00:13:43** And so then I was like, well, at least I have two dozen, three dozen,

**00:13:47** four dozen receipts for masks that were sent to my house.

**00:13:51** I'm sure I can work it out by going through those.

**00:13:55** And I cannot.

**00:13:58** And I'll tell you, no one is more frustrated than me

**00:14:01** because I would like to buy more than one of these.

**00:14:05** So here's the deal, listeners.

**00:14:07** If between now and when Mike edits and posts the show,

**00:14:12** I can figure out which mask it is.

**00:14:15** There will be a link in the show notes, but if I can't figure it out,

**00:14:20** we can play crowdsource again and I'll give Mike pictures of the mask

**00:14:25** and people can figure out which one it is.

**00:14:28** And so we'll get the answer one way or the other.

**00:14:30** But yeah, so I have a mask that I quite like

**00:14:33** and I have no idea what company made it.

**00:14:36** Thanks, everyone.

**00:14:36** Did you buy the Adidas ones that I recommended?

**00:14:40** Yeah, I hated them.

**00:14:41** I hated everything about them.

**00:14:42** What would you not like about them?

**00:14:44** The logo. The logo was like, well, I knew I said that.

**00:14:48** No, I said that though, didn't I? Do you remember?

**00:14:50** No, I know.

**00:14:51** I know perfectly well that you said it and I looked at it on the page

**00:14:55** and I thought, maybe I can live with this.

**00:14:59** Right. But but the answer is when it arrived in the house, it was like,

**00:15:04** I'm so physically revolted by this giant logo that that isn't even,

**00:15:09** you know, it's not like a nice design.

**00:15:11** It's just words. Adidas.

**00:15:13** No, it's got the little lines on it.

**00:15:15** You know, it's written on my face.

**00:15:17** Right. So so no, I absolutely hated it.

**00:15:20** Thank you for the suggestion.

**00:15:22** Zero out of five stars.

**00:15:23** If you remember, on the last episode, I mentioned that there was a mask

**00:15:27** that I wanted to try by a company called Atoms. Yes.

**00:15:30** They are now shipping to the UK.

**00:15:32** I have bought some and they're on the way.

**00:15:35** But these look to me to be similar in style to the Adidas ones.

**00:15:40** Right. Like, which is what I like, which is like that kind of like

**00:15:43** polyestery kind of material.

**00:15:45** And yeah, I don't like cloth coverings.

**00:15:48** I don't like surgical ones.

**00:15:50** I don't like ones that are made out of like thick material.

**00:15:52** Like this just really works for me.

**00:15:54** I've ordered a bunch of these.

**00:15:56** I may follow up with you, but I don't know.

**00:15:59** What about the logo on the Atoms mask?

**00:16:01** It just says atoms on it.

**00:16:02** Is that acceptable to you?

**00:16:05** I don't love it, but I could live with it because it's significantly

**00:16:09** less obnoxious than the Adidas logo.

**00:16:11** Right. OK.

**00:16:13** With the Adidas logo.

**00:16:15** Now, so you said it.

**00:16:16** OK, so there are two ways to say it and you said it a third way.

**00:16:20** What do you mean?

**00:16:21** It's Adidas, which is the American way or the UK one, which is Adidas.

**00:16:26** Adidas. What are you talking about?

**00:16:27** Which I actually think Adidas is the correct way to say it

**00:16:31** because the guy's name was Addy Dazzler.

**00:16:34** Wait, his name is not Adidas.

**00:16:36** Wait, ADI space.

**00:16:38** Dazzler. Is that what you're saying?

**00:16:40** Yes. Mr. Dazzler.

**00:16:42** Addy Dazzler. Well, OK.

**00:16:45** His name was Adolf Dazzler, but Addy for sure.

**00:16:47** Oh, that's awkward.

**00:16:49** Adolf is an unpopular name.

**00:16:50** I mean, he was born in 1900, so he couldn't have known.

**00:16:54** He was a German cobbler.

**00:16:56** It's still retroactively awkward.

**00:16:58** Yeah, it's funny that really is like

**00:17:00** it's a name that can never be used.

**00:17:02** Like who would do that?

**00:17:03** Who would call their kid Adolf?

**00:17:05** All right. Like it's just never going to happen.

**00:17:06** That name is lost to time.

**00:17:08** So many names, I think, that that's happened to.

**00:17:10** But that's definitely one of them.

**00:17:12** Yeah, for sure.

**00:17:14** Like I don't know if I can think of another one.

**00:17:16** Yeah. Well, also because of the problem, like Joseph Stalin

**00:17:19** didn't make Joe go out of style.

**00:17:21** Oh, I mean, which is interesting, right?

**00:17:24** Because I bet that there were lots of people called Adolf,

**00:17:27** but they were just maybe in one part of the world.

**00:17:30** Yeah. Yeah.

**00:17:31** Joseph sounds like Joseph in many different languages, right?

**00:17:37** Yeah. But I don't know what like the anglified name of Adolf is,

**00:17:42** but you know, most names have some kind of like parallel to them, don't they?

**00:17:46** Yeah. But yeah, anyway, so we don't call him Adolf Dazzler.

**00:17:51** Let's not focus on that.

**00:17:53** He was known as Addy Dazzler,

**00:17:55** and he created the German sportswear company Addy Dazz.

**00:17:58** Okay. Well, I don't like his name.

**00:18:00** I don't like his logo. End of story.

**00:18:03** This episode of Cortex is brought to you by Team History,

**00:18:06** a podcast that tells the stories of teams who work together

**00:18:09** in new and unexpected ways to achieve remarkable things.

**00:18:14** Every episode of Team History tells a story,

**00:18:16** and in each story, you'll find practical lessons

**00:18:19** for your team and your business.

**00:18:21** On this season, the show travels deep into the underwater caves

**00:18:24** with Northern Thailand to discover how divers,

**00:18:27** medics, soldiers, and volunteers freed a group of trapped teenagers.

**00:18:31** You might remember that story. Actually, I do.

**00:18:33** It explains how a world-renowned watch company

**00:18:36** pitted their two factories against each other

**00:18:39** in an attempt to become the best watchmaker in the world.

**00:18:42** It can also find out how Iceland went from having

**00:18:45** one of the highest COVID-19 death rates in Scandinavia

**00:18:48** to an interesting example of how the virus could be dealt with.

**00:18:52** You can discover stories that entertain.

**00:18:54** It's packed with business cases you can actually use.

**00:18:58** Season 2 of Team History is out now.

**00:19:00** It's hosted by award-winning documentary filmmaker,

**00:19:02** Gabriela Koppathwaite, the director of Blackfish.

**00:19:06** I got a sneak preview of season 2 of Team History.

**00:19:09** The episode that I listened to was all about an application called Wildbook,

**00:19:13** which helps conservators and researchers keep track of wild animals

**00:19:16** like whale sharks and zebras via an AI analysis of imagery.

**00:19:22** It's super fascinating stuff that is helping with conservation efforts

**00:19:25** and understanding the world around us that little bit better.

**00:19:28** A project like this was a huge undertaking involving many, many people.

**00:19:33** But the typical problems that are the same as a team of any size,

**00:19:37** stuff like data management, communication,

**00:19:39** these were the things they had to solve.

**00:19:40** These are things that we all have to manage.

**00:19:43** This show really indicates and highlights that teamwork comes in many, many forms.

**00:19:49** It's not just about office work by any stretch of the imagination.

**00:19:53** Search for Team History anywhere that you listen to podcasts

**00:19:56** or you can find a link in the show notes.

**00:19:59** Thanks to Team History for their support of this show and Relay FM.

**00:20:02** CortexMerch.com

**00:20:07** We've mentioned this in the past,

**00:20:10** but we're working hard on a new version of the theme system journal.

**00:20:14** We have some of the original journal in stock right now at CortexMerch.

**00:20:18** And because we are working on something new,

**00:20:21** we are doing something that most companies do in the merchandising space

**00:20:26** in that we are putting our current product on sale.

**00:20:29** All of this stuff is new to us because it's the first time we've done any of these types of things.

**00:20:34** But the remaining stock of version one of the theme system journal is on sale now for $15,

**00:20:42** which is a 25% decrease.

**00:20:44** We usually start it for $20.

**00:20:46** New stock is being produced for version two,

**00:20:48** which will go on sale sometime later this year.

**00:20:52** It is worth noting version two will be higher priced than version one

**00:20:56** because of some of the changes that we're making to the notebook and how it's made.

**00:20:59** So $15 for a theme system journal is an absolute bargain

**00:21:04** and it is worth remembering.

**00:21:05** I will say it here again.

**00:21:07** So if you do buy one of these,

**00:21:08** the layout and the system in the journal is not changing.

**00:21:12** So like the way that the journal is actually put together

**00:21:15** and the system itself isn't changing between version one and version two,

**00:21:19** there's just some tweaks we're making to how the stuff is put together,

**00:21:22** the product that we're using and there's a couple of little fun features that we're putting in.

**00:21:26** But if you buy version one,

**00:21:28** it's not like you're going to be using version one of the system,

**00:21:31** if that makes sense, right?

**00:21:32** Yeah, we haven't invented a new theme system for the new journal.

**00:21:37** It's the same theme system.

**00:21:39** It's still the same basic idea of what's happening.

**00:21:42** Yeah, there's just some visual tweaks really and then a couple of extra little features.

**00:21:46** But yeah, so if you have a journal and you want a journal

**00:21:49** or you've been interested to try it out,

**00:21:52** you can now get one for $15 and I will remain.

**00:21:55** It is a great time to re-theme your year.

**00:21:59** Still, I have been very happy, Grey,

**00:22:02** and we'll talk about this in a couple of episodes time

**00:22:04** when we do the 2021 yearly themes,

**00:22:06** but I have been very happy.

**00:22:07** I cannot believe that's coming up so soon.

**00:22:09** I just realized where that sentence was going.

**00:22:14** We are a few episodes away from 2021 yearly themes,

**00:22:19** but I have been very happy with setting a new theme

**00:22:22** and it has really invigorated my theme system journaling

**00:22:26** over the last few months in doing that

**00:22:28** because I feel like I'm actually moving towards something

**00:22:31** and living along something I can achieve

**00:22:33** rather than just spending the whole time thinking about

**00:22:35** how I can't do any of the things that I wanted to do at the beginning of the year.

**00:22:39** Right.

**00:22:40** I really recommend it.

**00:22:41** There's still a few months left of the year

**00:22:42** so you can go and get a journal now for just $15

**00:22:45** and try it out for yourself.

**00:22:47** Looking outside, what's happening, Mike?

**00:22:50** The leaves are turning.

**00:22:52** What is this?

**00:22:53** It's a new season.

**00:22:54** New season.

**00:22:54** The new season is a great time to get a new theme journal.

**00:22:58** On sale now, $15.

**00:23:01** Cortex March.

**00:23:04** Dot com.

**00:23:06** Diddly-loot!

**00:23:07** Very good.

**00:23:08** You did it.

**00:23:09** We can all do it.

**00:23:11** I have been waiting for this episode for months

**00:23:15** and I have been so excited over the last couple of days

**00:23:19** that we can share our iOS 14 home screens.

**00:23:23** Okay.

**00:23:23** Well, I'm calling shotgun straight away.

**00:23:26** You have to go first.

**00:23:27** That's totally fine.

**00:23:28** Just to lay the groundwork as to why I'm excited about this while we're doing this.

**00:23:33** iOS 14 introduced two key things to the iOS landscape

**00:23:38** as to why our home screens may look different.

**00:23:40** One of them is the app library,

**00:23:42** which means that we can now hide applications from the home screen.

**00:23:45** They no longer need to be on the home screen.

**00:23:48** You can hide whole screens.

**00:23:49** You can turn screens on and off if you want to.

**00:23:52** I've seen people say this, including in Federico Vatici's wonderful iOS 14 review,

**00:23:56** which is available now if you want to get more information on this kind of stuff.

**00:24:00** But he mentioned something that I thought if you're not doing,

**00:24:02** something you might like to do is to have like a home screen of applications

**00:24:07** that you can just turn on and off when you want to see it.

**00:24:09** You know, it's kind of like a nice little idea.

**00:24:11** So you could have like all of your work apps on a screen

**00:24:14** and you can just like long press on the home screen

**00:24:16** and you can turn screens on and off, which is kind of nice.

**00:24:18** Okay.

**00:24:19** So yeah, like so this is one of these things like I have to stop you right there

**00:24:21** because like I sort of forgot that this was even a thing.

**00:24:24** Yeah, right.

**00:24:25** And it's like because there is a lot of aesthetic differences between last time

**00:24:29** and this time and so even right now, it's like, okay,

**00:24:33** so I how do I set a screen to be turn offable?

**00:24:36** Because I can't figure it out long press anywhere to go into jiggle mode, right?

**00:24:40** Okay, I'm jiggling.

**00:24:42** There's jiggling now, you know, you've got the little dots for indicate

**00:24:45** which home screen you're on tap that it shows you all of your pages

**00:24:51** and then you can turn pages on and off.

**00:24:54** So like when I installed iOS 14, all I did was I immediately went there

**00:24:58** and just turned off my pages two and three.

**00:25:00** So I don't have to see them anymore.

**00:25:01** And that's where all my apps were right.

**00:25:03** And they're just right.

**00:25:05** So you know, but like people do this and I think you can make sense, right?

**00:25:08** Like you can put all of your work related applications there.

**00:25:12** And then when you're on vacation or it's the weekend, just turn them off

**00:25:15** and you don't even get distracted by notification batches anymore.

**00:25:18** So this is okay.

**00:25:20** So here's the thing about iOS 14.

**00:25:22** There is a lot of really cool stuff here, but a lot of it is hard to find.

**00:25:26** So app library is one.

**00:25:28** So we can now no longer need to have every app need to have a place on a home screen

**00:25:33** or in a folder, they can just go straight to the app library.

**00:25:36** And then also, of course, the big one is widgets.

**00:25:39** So there are now widgets available on the iPhone home screen,

**00:25:43** which has never happened before.

**00:25:45** So Apple has finally joined Android in this.

**00:25:48** I overall have been really excited about the widget stuff.

**00:25:51** The design and the customization and the flexibility is more than I expected

**00:25:55** it would be, but we'll get into that a little bit more.

**00:25:58** But yeah, so now I have widgets on my home screen.

**00:26:01** I am assuming you may have at least something on yours.

**00:26:04** We'll have to see, but I am mostly intrigued to see how or if you have changed

**00:26:09** your home screens now that you have more control over what you can and can't see.

**00:26:13** Mmm.

**00:26:14** We'll see.

**00:26:15** All right.

**00:26:15** Anyway, I spent some time today putting together a nice little graphic for you.

**00:26:21** Oh, okay.

**00:26:21** This is this is great.

**00:26:22** This is this is super great.

**00:26:24** So I have taken a screenshot of all of my pages.

**00:26:29** Oh my goodness.

**00:26:30** Okay.

**00:26:30** And stitch them together.

**00:26:32** This includes.

**00:26:33** Oh, that's a much better idea.

**00:26:35** Okay, right.

**00:26:36** So I will do with anything you share with me.

**00:26:39** I would do this the same for the show notes.

**00:26:41** So when you look at the image, basically what I've done is starting from the

**00:26:45** today view, I have taken a screenshot of my widgets and also because you can you

**00:26:51** can lay a widgets on top of each other like a stack, right?

**00:26:54** It's cool.

**00:26:55** So I've also swiped through the stacks and taken images there.

**00:26:58** So you can see every widget I have, right?

**00:27:01** Because otherwise some will be hidden.

**00:27:03** Right.

**00:27:03** So like if you're looking at the far left, I have a stack of shortcuts

**00:27:07** widgets on top of each other.

**00:27:09** So I've taken screenshots of the widgets.

**00:27:12** I only took two screenshots because the third widget saying is just a set of

**00:27:15** timers, which I actually don't really use anymore.

**00:27:17** So I think I'm going to get rid of that widget and then we go through the

**00:27:20** today view and then to my home screens.

**00:27:22** Okay.

**00:27:23** Okay.

**00:27:23** Hold on.

**00:27:24** Yeah.

**00:27:24** I need a minute to take all this in like this.

**00:27:26** There's so much going on.

**00:27:28** Yeah.

**00:27:28** This is a visual bombardment here.

**00:27:31** Okay.

**00:27:32** So the stuff to the left, are we just scrolling down your formerly called

**00:27:37** today view or still called today view?

**00:27:39** I think it's still called today view.

**00:27:40** I don't know what it's called anymore, but yeah, we're scrolling down today.

**00:27:44** That word never made any sense.

**00:27:46** The first two, they're the same section, right?

**00:27:49** But I've just gone through different widgets.

**00:27:51** Then we scroll down and we have calendar, timer, we have OmniFocus.

**00:27:55** This is the beta version of the widgets.

**00:27:57** I don't think they'll be available yet, but they'll be available soon.

**00:28:01** And then we have more time reason and photos and batteries, right?

**00:28:04** So that's, that's my today view.

**00:28:06** Oh, so you're, you're running the beta of OmniFocus, right?

**00:28:09** Okay.

**00:28:09** That makes sense of what some of the stuff is.

**00:28:10** I was like, how are you doing this?

**00:28:11** But you're in, you're in the beta program for OmniFocus.

**00:28:14** I think it's an open beta though.

**00:28:15** So you can, you can join it.

**00:28:17** Yeah.

**00:28:18** Yeah.

**00:28:18** Yeah.

**00:28:19** You know, but someone once was like, Oh, you want to upgrade to the beta

**00:28:23** with you or a task manager?

**00:28:24** Do you?

**00:28:24** And I was like, you know what?

**00:28:25** Maybe I should never do this.

**00:28:26** That was a terrible idea.

**00:28:27** So there were two things when that happened.

**00:28:29** One, that was when they were doing the database migration, which is not a

**00:28:32** thing that I would do.

**00:28:33** That's a great time to do the beta, but I really wanted the widgets.

**00:28:37** Right.

**00:28:37** Right.

**00:28:38** Yeah.

**00:28:38** Right.

**00:28:39** So what, so let me, I'll do an actual run through for you here.

**00:28:42** Yeah.

**00:28:42** Says you or any of us don't know what certain widgets are.

**00:28:45** Right.

**00:28:45** So start, we have a stack of shortcuts widgets to begin and they live on

**00:28:51** the left hand side and the today view because that's where it's all been

**00:28:54** for me for a long time.

**00:28:55** Right.

**00:28:56** Like these shortcuts widgets replaced the shortcut widget that was previous.

**00:29:00** And this is where I always had that.

**00:29:02** So we have a grid of eight in total widgets.

**00:29:06** I have a couple for OmniFocus.

**00:29:08** I have my show prep shortcut, right?

**00:29:10** Tap that.

**00:29:11** It asks me what show I'm working on sets a timer and opens the appropriate

**00:29:15** Google doc for that.

**00:29:17** I then have a home fan and a studio fan.

**00:29:20** So like they're like fans and heaters.

**00:29:22** I haven't home and in the studio.

**00:29:23** So I can turn those on and off.

**00:29:25** My shortcuts.

**00:29:27** I have a cortex posting checklist thing.

**00:29:31** So more text listeners will know about this.

**00:29:33** I spoke about this a couple of episodes ago where I reworked some automation

**00:29:38** that I had using drafts and things for a checklist that I produce whenever

**00:29:43** I publish an episode of cortex.

**00:29:45** So that lives there and then also something boring CPM calculator.

**00:29:50** CPM is an advertising metric for how much you charge and I just have a calculator

**00:29:56** for it because I can never remember the calculation.

**00:29:59** So I built a shortcut to do it for me then underneath that, right?

**00:30:02** So we have to look on the right image now.

**00:30:04** Sorry, it gets a little confusing for what's underneath that in that stack.

**00:30:09** These are all these are my time tracking related shortcuts.

**00:30:12** So I have start any timer so that I just tap that and it will give me a list

**00:30:16** of all of my time as I can tap and it just begins.

**00:30:19** Right.

**00:30:19** It doesn't need to open any application.

**00:30:21** That's the one thing that shortcuts has every other widget opens an app,

**00:30:25** but the shortcuts widget doesn't need to open the app.

**00:30:28** Recording and editing is another one where when I tap that shortcut,

**00:30:31** it asks me are you recording or editing right now?

**00:30:34** And if I say recording it sets a timer based on what's in my calendar.

**00:30:38** So I like that one.

**00:30:39** Yeah, I always think that's that's that's one of my favorite like little clever

**00:30:42** automation things that you've ever mentioned.

**00:30:45** Like it never would have crossed my mind was like, oh, of course you already

**00:30:47** have this data somewhere.

**00:30:48** I could just love that as a shortcut.

**00:30:50** You have to name things particularly, right?

**00:30:52** Oh, of course.

**00:30:53** Yeah, but if you do that and honestly, I actually didn't have to change anything,

**00:30:57** but I just have to be careful stuff I had in the future.

**00:30:59** Plus track time is one that I use all the time, which is if I've forgotten

**00:31:03** to set a timer for the work that I'm doing I can hit that and it will say

**00:31:08** how many minutes and then which thing do you want to assign it to?

**00:31:11** So I like that update tag will just update the current time tracker

**00:31:15** with a different tag and then I have stop timer and open timer.

**00:31:18** So they're my time tracking shortcuts.

**00:31:21** I use those less and less now because of the time re widget.

**00:31:24** There are many different time re widgets and that's the one that's sitting

**00:31:27** underneath and it's showing I was preparing for cortex whilst putting

**00:31:31** this stuff together obviously, right?

**00:31:32** So the time re widget is is better and worse in different ways.

**00:31:37** It's not through for the developer like one of the things with widgets

**00:31:40** and iOS 14 is they cannot be interactive.

**00:31:43** This is a shortcuts widget.

**00:31:44** It's the only one that can be interactive.

**00:31:46** So the old time re widget used to have a bunch of buttons and you tap

**00:31:50** them and it would start and stop timers, right?

**00:31:52** I never need to open the app.

**00:31:53** That isn't the case anymore, but I've gotten really used to having

**00:31:57** the added utility of so I have that like the current running timer there

**00:32:02** and I can tap that and it gives me a lot of different options, right?

**00:32:05** When you're actually open the application.

**00:32:07** So I've gotten used to it and plus there are some other time re widgets

**00:32:11** that I have which didn't exist before or couldn't have existed before.

**00:32:15** And overall for me, it's kind of like made up the whole package to

**00:32:18** make it worth it.

**00:32:22** Fantastic.

**00:32:22** Cal underneath.

**00:32:24** So this is the big Fantastic.

**00:32:26** Cal widget.

**00:32:26** So I've got the day and a calendar and then showing me what's on my

**00:32:31** calendar for the day.

**00:32:32** No, you're a heat map of calendar busyness makes me feel physically

**00:32:37** ill just looking at it.

**00:32:38** I thought you wouldn't like that.

**00:32:39** I mean, I yeah, that's a fantastic feature.

**00:32:45** It's a cool feature.

**00:32:45** Yeah.

**00:32:46** I remember turning it on once and being like, oh, of course this

**00:32:48** makes no sense for me at all because almost every one of my days is

**00:32:51** like there's nothing scheduled for today.

**00:32:53** And then it's just like a couple of things, but I think that's a really,

**00:32:57** really nice feature and in a widget.

**00:33:00** That's a that's a great way to like, oh, let me have a quick look at my calendar.

**00:33:03** Yeah, that's the idea of the information being glanceable.

**00:33:07** This is a perfect thing.

**00:33:08** At first, I didn't like it because it's quite visually busy, but I kind

**00:33:13** of left it on for a bit and I've grown to enjoy it.

**00:33:16** And it's basically when you look at the image, it starts off with like

**00:33:19** nothing to yellow to orange and it's basically like a traffic light

**00:33:24** system of how busy your day is and the deeper the color, the more

**00:33:29** events you have on the calendar.

**00:33:30** So it's just an easy way like a glance to see like when am I busy?

**00:33:34** When am I not busy?

**00:33:35** Then I have underneath that.

**00:33:37** So we're on to the third image in this panel now, right?

**00:33:40** This is a timery widget showing what I have tracked for the day.

**00:33:46** Then we have one of the OmniFocus widgets underneath which is showing me

**00:33:50** kind of my forecast over the next few days.

**00:33:53** And then it also has a list of stuff that's due today.

**00:33:56** As someone who's in the OmniFocus beta, I just have to ask now like the

**00:34:00** forecast view was interesting.

**00:34:01** I presume that you can just set a custom perspective for one of those

**00:34:05** instead, like that's an option on the widgets.

**00:34:08** They have a separate set of widgets in the current beta.

**00:34:12** It could all change that are called perspective widgets and I don't

**00:34:15** believe they show the forecast, but you can just get a list of all

**00:34:18** tasks in a perspective.

**00:34:19** Yeah, great.

**00:34:20** That's what I'm looking for.

**00:34:21** I specifically don't want the forecast, but as I was like, oh, I

**00:34:24** hope that forecast isn't attached to everything.

**00:34:26** So that's why I had to know.

**00:34:27** I had to interrupt you there for my selfish reasons.

**00:34:31** Then I have underneath that another timery widget.

**00:34:34** This is also something I like.

**00:34:35** You can have multiple widgets with multiple different information

**00:34:38** types and at a request that I made the developer timery Joe allowed

**00:34:45** for me to selectively change the theme.

**00:34:47** I think all widgets should have this.

**00:34:49** Widgets have dark and light themes to them.

**00:34:52** If a lot of developers have actually worked to create lots of different

**00:34:56** color options and I love that so I can choose what I want the colors

**00:35:00** to be, but other than that, they have they will all pretty much have

**00:35:03** dark and light themes to them.

**00:35:06** Yeah, I want the developer to allow me to choose if I want the widget

**00:35:10** to have a light or a dark theme and not just take it by what's on the

**00:35:13** system and because that's what I wanted here.

**00:35:15** Like I have two widgets that look very similar.

**00:35:18** They're just graphs, right?

**00:35:20** But I know the light one means today and the dark one means this week.

**00:35:25** Yeah, what I also love is with these timery widgets, you can make

**00:35:28** lots of choices.

**00:35:29** So this is just showing me podcast related stuff what I've tracked in

**00:35:34** a week.

**00:35:35** Okay, that's what this is.

**00:35:37** Right.

**00:35:37** So this is a combination of prep recording and editing with just show

**00:35:42** tags and busy week for upgrade this week.

**00:35:45** Why was that Mike?

**00:35:46** Yeah, yeah, yeah, Apple event again.

**00:35:50** So upgrade and connected actually, it's more than I would usually spend.

**00:35:55** Oh, yeah.

**00:35:56** Connected right behind it.

**00:35:57** Yeah, in a week.

**00:35:59** Yeah, five hours for each of those is basically a full-on work day

**00:36:03** nearly for each show, but that's kind of how it goes.

**00:36:06** Then I have the photos widget.

**00:36:07** The photos widget is an absolute joy.

**00:36:10** This is the Apple's photos widget and it surfaces just photos from

**00:36:14** your library and every day I get something where I'm like, oh, look

**00:36:17** at that or hey, that happened.

**00:36:19** Or you know, it's an I like that widget a lot shortcuts and photos

**00:36:23** are the only Apple widgets that I'm using.

**00:36:25** Then I had the bat and the batteries widget, which I always forget exists,

**00:36:28** but it's there so now we move on to my actual home screen.

**00:36:33** Question one is why do you have the fantastic Cal widget duplicated?

**00:36:38** Like you have you have it on the today view and you have it on your

**00:36:41** home screen.

**00:36:41** Why?

**00:36:42** Well, I don't very frequently look in my today view.

**00:36:48** Right.

**00:36:48** So really today view serves to get to my shortcuts and and also

**00:36:54** the timer II, but if I want to like if I'm purposely thinking, oh,

**00:36:57** hey, I want to just get a quick glance at stuff.

**00:37:00** I could look at the calendar widget there really that the top two

**00:37:04** widgets in today view past that I don't really look at them very often.

**00:37:07** They're just like here's a bunch of data in case I want it, right?

**00:37:10** Okay, that makes sense.

**00:37:11** But if I want to see my calendar, I want it on my home screen.

**00:37:15** Okay, and so you just have it in a stack with the weather so you

**00:37:17** can flip to it if it's not already presented to you.

**00:37:20** Yeah, I have fantastic Cal and carrot weather in the top slot.

**00:37:24** They're both medium size widgets and I have this one doing the auto

**00:37:28** rotating the Apple does and most of the time I feel like I see what

**00:37:32** I want, but it's because I only have the two widgets there.

**00:37:34** It's really easy to flick between the two of them.

**00:37:37** Yeah, what I've been able to do with these two and this is like a

**00:37:40** thing that I've been trying out is now I no longer have fantastic

**00:37:44** Cal and carrots apps on my home screen, right?

**00:37:47** Right.

**00:37:47** Yeah, because yeah, you don't because when I want to get to them,

**00:37:50** I just tap the widget and it opens the app took a little bit.

**00:37:53** I'm getting used to that, but now I'm pretty used to it after like

**00:37:57** a couple of weeks of doing this and I would say fantastic Cal

**00:38:01** and carrot weather.

**00:38:03** They're like my favorite, you know, I really love time read widgets

**00:38:08** too, but like these the widgets that I'm using they're the ones that

**00:38:11** have to stand to test the time, but the fantastic Cal and carrot

**00:38:13** ones are excellent.

**00:38:14** I think probably my favorite widget is the carrot weather widget

**00:38:17** because this one widget I use the forecast widget and it's just

**00:38:22** fantastic because it shows different types of data at different

**00:38:27** times.

**00:38:28** So like in the morning, I get a like and in the early afternoon,

**00:38:34** I get a like a daily by hour forecast, right?

**00:38:38** What the rest of the day is going to be like in the evening.

**00:38:41** It changes to a weekly forecast.

**00:38:45** So I can see what's coming up over the next few days because in

**00:38:49** the evening, I don't really need to know the hour by hour, right?

**00:38:52** Yeah, at that point you don't care like what was the high today.

**00:38:56** Exactly.

**00:38:56** It's not relevant information anymore.

**00:38:58** And if it's going to rain or if it's raining it changes to the rain

**00:39:02** widget like rain information in the widget.

**00:39:05** So like it's going to rain for the next hour and here's the graph

**00:39:08** of rain.

**00:39:09** Yeah, once again, I'm continually impressed by the carrot developer

**00:39:15** and just like the the aggressive use of all of the new features that

**00:39:21** come out every time and also almost always thinking about them

**00:39:24** in an interesting way.

**00:39:26** It's like I use this widget but all of those widgets that I do

**00:39:29** all of those view types that I just mentioned there also their

**00:39:31** own independent widgets.

**00:39:33** So if you only want to have always the hourly one you can do

**00:39:37** that and also all of the information in that widget is configurable.

**00:39:41** So I said I want the high and low the precipitation and the UV

**00:39:45** index and I also want the temperatures and feels like because

**00:39:48** it's the only temperature that matters.

**00:39:49** And you can do all of that.

**00:39:51** And so yeah, the carrot weather widget is just stupendous like

**00:39:55** it's absolutely stupendous again, as you said as always and then

**00:40:00** else on my home screen.

**00:40:02** I have the small forecast widget for OmniFocus which I at first

**00:40:07** wasn't sure about this but I actually really like it now.

**00:40:11** What I don't need is past so much.

**00:40:15** I would prefer today in the next two days.

**00:40:17** Rather than past today and the next day.

**00:40:19** Yeah, because it's just not really something that I'm fussed

**00:40:22** about but I also understand it could look a bit visually weird

**00:40:26** to have the highlighted day be on the leftmost side of that

**00:40:28** three column.

**00:40:30** But nevertheless, I like this and when I tap it opens OmniFocus

**00:40:34** to the forecast view which is where I mostly am.

**00:40:37** I have it in a stack with a shortcut underneath which is my

**00:40:43** OmniFocus task which is where I'm mostly in.

**00:40:45** Which is my OmniFocus task shortcut which is the only way

**00:40:49** I enter tasks into OmniFocus.

**00:40:52** Oh, okay.

**00:40:52** So this is this is for input the OmniFocus.

**00:40:56** Oh, that's clever to have it under there.

**00:40:57** I was I was wondering what the deal was.

**00:40:59** I thought you might just be using this shortcut to open

**00:41:01** a perspective but I thought that doesn't seem like Mike.

**00:41:03** This is going to do something else that makes that that's

**00:41:06** actually a really good idea to have the input be in a stack

**00:41:10** that's under something else.

**00:41:11** Yeah, just flick up tap and enter a task into OmniFocus.

**00:41:16** That's a really good idea.

**00:41:16** Yeah on their larger widget sizes.

**00:41:19** They have like a button.

**00:41:20** Well, like when you tap it opens to the entry, but I like entering

**00:41:26** OmniFocus tasks by shortcuts like their shortcut supports

**00:41:29** very good.

**00:41:29** It's very easy to build.

**00:41:30** Yeah, it's very fast.

**00:41:33** This is the same shortcut that I have in the shortcuts widget

**00:41:37** that's in my today view.

**00:41:38** I'm trialing it out here as well.

**00:41:40** But there's just like something I like about the logic of why

**00:41:43** I can just flick it over and press that to enter a task.

**00:41:46** So before we move on, how are you feeling about my home screen?

**00:41:50** Is the only place where there's apps now is on this one screen

**00:41:54** as you can see.

**00:41:56** Yeah, yeah, I like your wallpaper selection there.

**00:41:59** I feel like I do it.

**00:42:00** Yeah, I think that's a good one.

**00:42:02** Like thank you.

**00:42:03** It's a little busy, but I think it's it works because it's flat.

**00:42:06** It is a photo.

**00:42:07** I took of the wallpaper at the Beverly Hills Hotel.

**00:42:10** Oh, that's nice.

**00:42:12** Yeah, that's nice.

**00:42:12** Okay, that'll okay.

**00:42:14** I can aesthetically I can understand that that makes sense.

**00:42:18** So yeah, I like it.

**00:42:19** You you've definitely had worse wallpaper.

**00:42:20** Oh, I know.

**00:42:22** This is why I'm happy because I think this is like my favorite

**00:42:25** wallpaper.

**00:42:26** I actually have it on all of my devices.

**00:42:28** I love it so much.

**00:42:29** And so I'm pleased that you're not repulsed by it.

**00:42:32** And I'm especially enthused that you think it's actually quite

**00:42:35** nice.

**00:42:36** Yeah, that's extra funny that it is literally wallpaper as

**00:42:39** well.

**00:42:39** Yeah, I hadn't thought that.

**00:42:41** Yeah, that's a good joke in there.

**00:42:42** I really struggled with with paring down my my screens here

**00:42:46** because I wanted to just have one.

**00:42:48** That was what I wanted.

**00:42:50** I may change this in the future, but that was what I wanted

**00:42:52** to go for and I had to like sacrifice a couple of applications

**00:42:57** so I could fit that two by two widget in there because you

**00:43:01** know, I was able to free up some space because there was some

**00:43:04** apps I didn't need anymore, but like it was really a thing

**00:43:06** of trying to work it out.

**00:43:07** Like I never had the clock on my main home screen.

**00:43:11** It was always on a second screen, but of applications that

**00:43:14** I am opening and closing every day.

**00:43:16** The clock is one of them because I turn on and off alarms.

**00:43:19** I don't have the same alarm every day.

**00:43:21** I selectively turn on alarms depending on when I want to

**00:43:23** wake up the next day.

**00:43:25** So like the clock app had to come forward, right, which

**00:43:28** meant something had to go.

**00:43:29** So yeah, it was it took a bit of time to get there, but I'm

**00:43:33** I feel pretty happy about the selection of apps that I have

**00:43:38** on the home screen.

**00:43:40** Yeah, I was originally like why is discord on there?

**00:43:43** But but of course while you were talking I worked my way

**00:43:45** through of like, oh, I know why discord's on there.

**00:43:49** Well, it's actually a couple of reasons.

**00:43:50** So I spend a lot of time in discord now because we have the

**00:43:54** discord available for real AFM members of which if you go to

**00:43:58** getmoretext.com and get more text, which is more cortex with

**00:44:01** no ads, you can also get access to the real FM members

**00:44:05** discord. But also the keyboard hobby is very discord heavy.

**00:44:10** Oh, oh, right.

**00:44:11** You're I forgot you're participating in your keyboard

**00:44:15** scene on discord.

**00:44:16** That's where the cool kids hang out for the keyboard stuff.

**00:44:18** It's also good for like product releases.

**00:44:21** Like if you're in discords, they'll ping the discord and

**00:44:23** say like, hey, we have a new product.

**00:44:25** And so, you know, I'm a part of like 20 discords, but I

**00:44:29** don't look at any more, but I don't look at any more.

**00:44:31** Then like two of them.

**00:44:33** Okay, the rest of them are just like I'm there in case they

**00:44:35** like say, hey, this new thing is available for sale right

**00:44:39** now, right?

**00:44:40** Like, you know, so I have that it's just like a thing where

**00:44:43** I can look in these places if I want to.

**00:44:45** But yeah, as I dive deeper and deeper into mechanical

**00:44:48** keyboards, discord is becoming more of a thing.

**00:44:51** Okay.

**00:44:51** Yeah.

**00:44:52** So yeah, that makes that makes total sense.

**00:44:54** The one that catches my eye, but this is just because I've

**00:44:57** you know, I've been on a renewed crusade about this with

**00:45:00** people, but I was like, oh, you've got you've got Twitter

**00:45:03** down there.

**00:45:03** Like, how often are you opening Twitter every day?

**00:45:05** Mike, I don't it's on your dock.

**00:45:07** Like real behind real estate to my screen crimes and tell

**00:45:10** you, can't I?

**00:45:13** Yes, you can tell me in your screen crimes screen time

**00:45:16** screen, scream, scream.

**00:45:18** God damn it.

**00:45:18** I still can't do it.

**00:45:20** Why is it so hard?

**00:45:24** It isn't for most people though.

**00:45:26** It is.

**00:45:27** No, it's like it's a tongue twister screen time crime.

**00:45:30** It's impossible.

**00:45:32** No one can say it.

**00:45:33** Well, again, it tells you it's the app you open after pickups,

**00:45:37** right?

**00:45:37** And on average, it's 22 first used after pickup, but that's

**00:45:43** you know, but really like if I look like over the week, it's

**00:45:47** always the top one or two applications for me.

**00:45:50** It's in top one or two for pickups.

**00:45:52** Yeah, for first use after pickup.

**00:45:54** Yeah, and also for actual usage.

**00:45:58** I spent a lot of time.

**00:45:59** Although I will say actually that the numbers are starting

**00:46:02** to get skewed now because I'm using a Mac with Catalina, which

**00:46:07** also reports into these figures.

**00:46:09** Oh, oh, right, right.

**00:46:10** Okay.

**00:46:10** So yes, you yeah, this is this is I don't I don't know.

**00:46:13** Like do we have a regular time when we talk about screen

**00:46:17** crimes?

**00:46:17** I can't remember.

**00:46:18** We do not but I have it in my topic list for a future episode

**00:46:23** where I want to go through that again, mainly because I realized

**00:46:27** that was like.

**00:46:27** Oh, I actually have a much bigger picture.

**00:46:30** See like things that things are misreporting, right?

**00:46:32** Because I have here.

**00:46:34** I'm looking at it now nine hours in notion.

**00:46:37** I'm not using nine hours of notion.

**00:46:39** Just open on the Mac.

**00:46:41** Yeah, we never we never talked about this, but like in the

**00:46:44** last rollout, like I've always been extremely frustrated with

**00:46:48** you know, the way Apple does this stuff and just like the

**00:46:52** way downtime works and the way time reporting works.

**00:46:55** And yeah, after that last rollout where they include the Mac

**00:46:58** is like, hey guys, you know what?

**00:47:00** I don't need to see you've got finder open for 47 hours of

**00:47:04** the past week.

**00:47:05** It's like, thanks.

**00:47:06** I really appreciate that.

**00:47:08** Oh, there was a finder window open on my computer while I

**00:47:10** was doing other stuff for 47 hours really useful.

**00:47:14** I understand why they're doing it because they're primarily

**00:47:17** viewing it as a like parental time control tool and like

**00:47:23** incidentally a let us tell you how you're using your computer

**00:47:27** thing. But yeah, the moment that rolled out within a week,

**00:47:29** I was like, oh my god, I have to turn off the share across

**00:47:32** all devices because this is right.

**00:47:35** This is totally crazy and madness and also the weird way

**00:47:39** that I want to run my phone is infecting absolutely everything

**00:47:42** else. And so it was it's very odd now.

**00:47:45** Yeah, we'll come back to this.

**00:47:47** Yeah.

**00:47:47** Yeah.

**00:47:49** But yeah, I just did that to like just turn it onto one device

**00:47:51** or the other and it really changes things.

**00:47:54** But yeah, Twitter is high on Twitter as high for me.

**00:47:58** You know, it's like one of those things with should I

**00:48:00** smoking should I use Twitter less?

**00:48:02** Yes, sure.

**00:48:04** But doom scrolling now, you know, that's where I have in

**00:48:06** my life sometimes these days.

**00:48:08** I know but it's just like oof the dock.

**00:48:11** It makes me sad to see it on the dock there and then like

**00:48:13** oh top top one pickup.

**00:48:15** Don't do it.

**00:48:16** Don't do it man.

**00:48:17** I tweet less but consume as much.

**00:48:20** Yeah.

**00:48:21** Okay.

**00:48:21** So, you know, tweeting less is great.

**00:48:23** It is great.

**00:48:24** But I think Twitter literally makes people crazy.

**00:48:27** And even if you're just doom scrolling, it's like I've seen

**00:48:30** people become real weirdos and I think you can point it to

**00:48:34** Twitter a lot for the for the cause of that.

**00:48:36** So but I'm not I'm not here to I'm not here to shame you but

**00:48:39** it just like it just did catch my attention.

**00:48:40** I know it's a good question, especially on this show.

**00:48:43** These kinds of questions are good.

**00:48:45** And yes, I think it is something I would like to try and

**00:48:48** start addressing again.

**00:48:50** Maybe I'll make it a New Year's resolution.

**00:48:53** Yeah, make it a New Year's resolution.

**00:48:54** You're gonna quit smoking in Twitter.

**00:48:58** All right.

**00:48:59** So do we move on?

**00:48:59** Is there anything else on my home screen you wanted to

**00:49:01** point to?

**00:49:02** No, I was I was just curious if you happen to remember like

**00:49:05** who didn't make the cut for the widgets because like the

**00:49:09** thing that I think it's sort of interesting about upgrading

**00:49:12** for the first time to this version of the operating system

**00:49:14** and then playing around with widgets is I know one of my

**00:49:18** immediate experiences even as someone who you know, the if

**00:49:21** we if we take a look at the last time we looked at my home

**00:49:24** screen like there wasn't a lot there.

**00:49:26** I still feel like woof these widgets take up a lot of space.

**00:49:31** Yeah, and they they really do force a trade-off because

**00:49:35** there's a great utility in having four buttons and since

**00:49:40** many of the widgets are really like conveying some limited

**00:49:44** information.

**00:49:44** I think when you first start playing with them, it really

**00:49:47** does force you to like have to make some tough decisions

**00:49:50** about what what do you want there?

**00:49:52** So I'm just curious if you happen to remember who got cut.

**00:49:54** I can tell you I have an old screenshot in front of me who

**00:49:56** got cut.

**00:49:57** So the music app got cut.

**00:50:00** The files app got cut.

**00:50:02** Calzones got cut for good reason, which we'll get to in

**00:50:05** a bit.

**00:50:05** Fantastic Cal got cut because it could be cut for the widget.

**00:50:09** Right.

**00:50:09** I mean if you still had the Fantastic Cal icon on there,

**00:50:11** I'd be questioning your sanity.

**00:50:13** Indeed.

**00:50:13** The Canary app got cut.

**00:50:15** I just rely on notifications.

**00:50:17** This is my like security camera thing.

**00:50:19** Right.

**00:50:19** Okay.

**00:50:20** Carrot got cut.

**00:50:21** Narwhal Reddit client that I use.

**00:50:23** Airtable pipe drive, but those weren't really being used

**00:50:27** very much.

**00:50:28** Right shortcuts, timer-y.

**00:50:30** Okay.

**00:50:31** All right.

**00:50:31** That makes sense.

**00:50:32** There were a couple of applications on here that I was using

**00:50:34** to like fill out my home screen because I couldn't work out

**00:50:37** what to replace them with.

**00:50:38** Right.

**00:50:38** Right.

**00:50:39** Of course.

**00:50:39** And then there was some that I got to get rid of because of

**00:50:43** the fact that I was adding their widgets.

**00:50:46** So and you have you haven't gone the cool kid route of redoing

**00:50:50** all of your home screen icons with shortcut shortcuts.

**00:50:54** You know, I will say if Apple removed the requirement to

**00:51:00** have it open shortcuts first, I would consider it.

**00:51:05** Interesting.

**00:51:06** You know, I did have a thought of like CGP Grey ahead of

**00:51:09** the curve, right?

**00:51:11** All these teens have discovered having custom shortcuts for

**00:51:15** icons, but you were doing it for years.

**00:51:17** My only thought on this is like, well, well, well, like everyone

**00:51:21** thought I was crazy.

**00:51:22** Like, oh, like your whole home screen is shortcuts.

**00:51:24** That's ridiculous.

**00:51:25** And it was like, I'll just wait.

**00:51:27** I'll wait in the like, I forged the world with my attention

**00:51:31** and the world will eventually come to me and it's like here

**00:51:33** we are.

**00:51:34** But I honestly, I wasn't sure if you would decide to go all

**00:51:38** in on this of like now would be the time to try the shortcuts.

**00:51:41** But for you opening the shortcut app is still the deal breaker.

**00:51:45** I don't like it visually.

**00:51:47** I think it's super cool.

**00:51:49** Right.

**00:51:49** And I applaud people who are taking the time to pick or create

**00:51:54** their own icons and set them all up.

**00:51:56** You have no idea what we're talking about.

**00:51:57** I'll put some links in the show notes, but it's so me me that

**00:52:00** if you use an iPhone, you probably have heard about this

**00:52:03** thing.

**00:52:03** Yeah, if you're not already doing it yourself and if you've

**00:52:05** been listening to Cortex, like you were just talking about

**00:52:07** this for years as well.

**00:52:08** You've been doing it for years.

**00:52:09** But if Apple did do that, if they would just like stop having

**00:52:12** to open the shortcuts app or if they created a official like

**00:52:16** this is how you change your icons type thing.

**00:52:18** I would 100% do it.

**00:52:20** Right.

**00:52:20** Like I would find some cool icons online.

**00:52:22** Loads of people selling great icon packs now and I would have

**00:52:25** something that was maybe a little bit more to my aesthetic

**00:52:28** tastes or whatever and or something I thought of.

**00:52:30** Like I could have certain applications that when I tap them

**00:52:33** they open to exactly where I want them to be in that app.

**00:52:37** Right.

**00:52:37** Because that's something that you could maybe do right where

**00:52:40** it's like, you know, I might have like an OmniFocus icon,

**00:52:43** which just opens to a specific view in OmniFocus rather than

**00:52:46** the last place I left off or whatever.

**00:52:47** Right.

**00:52:48** But no, I haven't done that because I don't like the jumping

**00:52:52** between applications.

**00:52:53** It's it wouldn't remind me.

**00:52:54** I know it wouldn't remind me.

**00:52:55** It's why I've never done it because that that step is a

**00:52:57** frustration for me.

**00:52:59** Yeah, I think that that's a totally fair.

**00:53:01** That's a totally fair frustration.

**00:53:02** Yeah.

**00:53:03** All right.

**00:53:03** So you have one more screen than when we slide over or two

**00:53:06** more screens.

**00:53:07** Two more screens of just widgets.

**00:53:09** Yeah, it's one and a bit because the very final screen

**00:53:12** there's just widgets.

**00:53:12** I'm testing or playing around with.

**00:53:15** Okay, but the next one is fixed.

**00:53:16** So I have two three widget Smith widgets and most people

**00:53:21** listening to this show.

**00:53:22** Well, I will say of course I have widget Smith widgets and

**00:53:25** most people would hear that and say well, yeah, of course

**00:53:28** because like everyone knows widget Smith.

**00:53:30** But my of course is because widget Smith is made by one of

**00:53:33** my closest friends underscore David Smith who we have mentioned

**00:53:36** on this show before he was went also to developer of

**00:53:39** apps like calzones which is an app I mentioned in cortex

**00:53:42** multiple times.

**00:53:43** Yes frequently mentioned on the show underscore David Smith

**00:53:47** fastest developer in the West and we are now just saying

**00:53:50** this to try and prove how cool we are that we know the guy

**00:53:53** who made widget Smith widget Smith which was like number

**00:53:56** one app on the world.

**00:53:57** I got to hang out with underscore at WWDC like that's

**00:54:01** so cool.

**00:54:03** I've been to his house.

**00:54:04** Okay.

**00:54:05** I think I know I was I don't know if you were testing widget

**00:54:08** Smith during the Bay Area period you weren't running Bay Area

**00:54:10** so no, I was I was I was late to the show Dave was number

**00:54:15** one for many weeks and it's still I think in the top 10 in

**00:54:18** the US and other countries.

**00:54:20** It really was it was just the app right like it was the app

**00:54:24** is what you download it.

**00:54:25** Right like I know I was thinking about as I joked with

**00:54:28** him about it, but I genuinely believe it's true.

**00:54:29** Like there were people updating their iPhone to get widget

**00:54:33** Smith, right?

**00:54:34** Like that was like a real thing which is an absolutely wild

**00:54:37** notion.

**00:54:38** He was basically the emoji of this release, but I was using

**00:54:43** two widget Smith widgets before it went wild which was the

**00:54:47** time one.

**00:54:48** So this is just shows me all the times in the time zones

**00:54:50** that I need to know about and the steps widget.

**00:54:53** So it shows how many steps I'm doing on a daily basis and

**00:54:56** then after widget Smith exploded.

**00:54:58** I was like, oh it does actually have all these other types

**00:55:01** of widgets and customization options that I never would have

**00:55:03** thought to look at and that was the whole funny thing about

**00:55:06** this of like of I think everyone that I knew that was testing

**00:55:10** the app.

**00:55:10** We are all just thinking like what is the best utility I can

**00:55:14** get out of this application when the rest of the world was

**00:55:16** like how can I use this application to customize my home

**00:55:19** screen, right?

**00:55:20** So after that was when I was like, why don't I actually try

**00:55:23** and theme these widgets to my background which I did.

**00:55:26** Yeah, it looks nice.

**00:55:27** It looks really nice and I am very happy with that.

**00:55:29** Actually, they were just black before I was like no I can

**00:55:32** make them look good.

**00:55:33** And then also I use the photos widget.

**00:55:36** One of the widgets that widgets myth is it can look in an

**00:55:39** album and I have an album of photos which I think is hilarious

**00:55:44** and adorable.

**00:55:45** I call it the close-up album and it's a selection of pictures

**00:55:48** that I take of Adina uncomfortably close to her face.

**00:55:53** Okay, which I just think is hilarious.

**00:55:55** I just have these like large selection of images where it's

**00:55:59** it's just too close and I think that's so funny and

**00:56:03** I have just have these images going over time.

**00:56:05** So it just pulls different ones there for me and some of them

**00:56:08** are hilarious and some of them are adorable and I like that

**00:56:11** a lot and then I also have another one of the photos

**00:56:13** widgets there.

**00:56:14** So it's just the same one.

**00:56:15** It's like a smaller version of Apple's photos widget, right?

**00:56:17** And then on the very final screen, there's another widget

**00:56:20** Smith widget, which I'm testing because Dave is working on

**00:56:24** analog clock stuff.

**00:56:25** So I was testing one for him to make sure it looked okay.

**00:56:28** And then the two at the top.

**00:56:30** Are like a trend of widgets that I've seen which I really

**00:56:33** like which are brilliant and hilarious.

**00:56:36** So one on the right is called sticky widgets and it is a

**00:56:38** widget version of the stickies app on the Mac.

**00:56:42** Okay, so you can tap on that type whatever you want in there

**00:56:47** and it's just like a sticky note that lives on your home

**00:56:49** screen and you can customize it.

**00:56:50** You can have as many of them as you want.

**00:56:52** It's kind of like brilliant and hilarious at the same time

**00:56:56** and then Scribble it is something similar which is it

**00:56:59** uses the pencil kit stuff.

**00:57:01** So you can draw with your finger of an Apple pencil on

**00:57:03** the iPad and bring it over to the iPhone and you can also

**00:57:06** bring up images and doodle and images.

**00:57:08** So they're just like two widget types of like if you wanted

**00:57:11** to keep basic information on your home screen.

**00:57:14** So I liked both of those and I've been kind of like playing

**00:57:16** around and testing them out.

**00:57:17** So that is my iOS 14 home screen selection gray.

**00:57:24** I mean, there's a lot going on.

**00:57:25** I mean, even with just the oh, there's eight screenshots

**00:57:30** in front of me to to survey.

**00:57:33** But I mean, I got to say I think this is I would I would

**00:57:37** rank this as one of your maybe the best looking of your of

**00:57:41** your home screens in the years that we've known each other.

**00:57:43** I'm happy with it.

**00:57:45** Like the aesthetics of it.

**00:57:46** I'm very very happy with it.

**00:57:48** I like that.

**00:57:48** I only have one screen that I have to focus on and then every

**00:57:52** other screen is just superfluous now and then the rest of

**00:57:55** it is just searches.

**00:57:57** I don't use the app library very much in the initial betas.

**00:58:00** I did because the app library was my second screen.

**00:58:03** I didn't have a second screen.

**00:58:05** So I was using it all the time.

**00:58:06** But the fact that I have to swipe like three times to get

**00:58:09** to it means I'm not using it very much.

**00:58:11** Yeah, yeah.

**00:58:12** Three swipes instead.

**00:58:13** Is a swipe up on the home screen to bring up the app library

**00:58:16** just like on Android.

**00:58:18** That's what I would like.

**00:58:20** Oh, that's interesting.

**00:58:21** I guess swipe up doesn't do anything on the home screen.

**00:58:23** I think that that that gesture is free.

**00:58:25** You know, like right at the very bottom.

**00:58:26** That's how you get to like the home or multitasking.

**00:58:29** Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, but in the same way that you pull

**00:58:32** down to go to search, I would like to pull up right to bring

**00:58:37** up the app library.

**00:58:38** That's what I would like.

**00:58:41** Huh, you found to use it that much.

**00:58:43** Okay, I would use it that much if it was there because when

**00:58:47** I only had the one screen, I was, you know, reflexively

**00:58:52** would swipe to the right to go to more applications, but I

**00:58:55** didn't have the home screens there, right?

**00:58:57** Then I would go to the app library and I found that the

**00:59:00** sorting was pretty good or if not, I could just search right

**00:59:02** from that screen.

**00:59:03** But yeah, I was using it, but now I'm not because it takes

**00:59:06** so many swipes to get over there, but I would use it more

**00:59:09** if it was more readily available to me.

**00:59:12** So how are you thinking about widgets in this widget world?

**00:59:16** So I think I mentioned on this show when we were talking

**00:59:21** about Sartre WDC that my hope, my best case scenario with

**00:59:27** widgets is that whilst we would lose functionality in

**00:59:32** interactivity that we would gain in some way, right?

**00:59:38** That like, yes, we've lost something in having widgets

**00:59:41** being able to do things inside of applications, but we

**00:59:44** will make a gain.

**00:59:44** And I think overall that the availability of widgets, the

**00:59:49** type of information and the applications that they're

**00:59:52** connected to vastly outweighs any downsides because my phone

**00:59:58** now gives me all of this information to some extent my iPad

**01:00:03** but Apple really need to with iOS 15 put find a way to make

**01:00:08** this work to put widgets on the home screen because then

**01:00:12** like is popping off at that point.

**01:00:15** My iPad is going to be incredible of all this information,

**01:00:18** right?

**01:00:19** It will be like command center.

**01:00:21** It'll be amazing.

**01:00:22** Yeah.

**01:00:22** Yeah.

**01:00:23** And and for sure, for sure, if Apple had known how big of

**01:00:28** a deal widgets were going to be, they would not have like

**01:00:32** like quarantined off.

**01:00:34** They would have put the work in the iPad.

**01:00:35** Yeah, like they would have done it if they would have known

**01:00:37** because I believe this is just a case of like priorities

**01:00:40** or whatever.

**01:00:40** There is no reason to do it other than the fact that they

**01:00:42** didn't do it.

**01:00:43** Every reason Apple is given is just like ass market and

**01:00:46** speak, right?

**01:00:46** Dudes widgets are so popular.

**01:00:48** You will sell iPads because people want more widgets.

**01:00:52** Yeah, like you they have to do it.

**01:00:54** Basically the what widget Smith did which it was widget

**01:00:57** Smith that did it right as made widgets more popular than

**01:01:02** anybody ever would have expected them to be without a

**01:01:05** shadow of a doubt.

**01:01:06** Right.

**01:01:07** And and now I think people are more willing to try out

**01:01:10** widgets from other applications that they use because

**01:01:13** hey, they're already used to adding widgets.

**01:01:15** So, you know, like yeah, so but what I like about them is

**01:01:20** that I'm getting this information.

**01:01:21** I have the weather on my calendar available to me all

**01:01:24** the time.

**01:01:25** Yeah, you know, I'm on my home screen a lot, right?

**01:01:29** And so that information is there and it's readily available

**01:01:32** to me and I really like having even just those two things

**01:01:37** if I had nothing else I would be happy to have that information

**01:01:41** because it's information.

**01:01:42** I frequently want frequently need and now I have it there.

**01:01:46** Like I'm more aware of when it's going to rain because the

**01:01:50** carat weather widget is telling me right when I'm looking at

**01:01:54** my home screen that is useful information having the photos

**01:01:59** widgets brings a smile to my face more in the day than before

**01:02:03** because I see these little memories is like, oh that was

**01:02:06** nice, right?

**01:02:07** And so I have that for me there and overall, I really like the

**01:02:12** aesthetics of finally having a different look to my home screen

**01:02:15** that it is no longer just a grid of icons super good.

**01:02:19** So I'm very pleased with what has happened so far even though

**01:02:24** really, you know, like widgets haven't been available for very

**01:02:27** long and more applications that I use are adding them over time.

**01:02:31** So yeah, I think I think it's really great and we all thought

**01:02:35** Apple would do more in year two of widgets, you know, maybe to

**01:02:38** make them more interactive or whatever whatever they end up

**01:02:41** doing, you know, they're going to do more of it because widgets

**01:02:43** have been an absolute unmitigated success for them.

**01:02:47** Yeah, yeah, I think like for sure.

**01:02:50** There's been a lot of meetings at Apple about like so widgets.

**01:02:55** What's the widget roadmap and whatever it was compress it

**01:03:00** compresses by a quarter.

**01:03:02** Yeah, we now have the widgets team.

**01:03:05** You know what?

**01:03:05** I wouldn't be the least bit surprised if there's a dedicated

**01:03:08** widgets team in a way that there wasn't before.

**01:03:10** I'm sure there's at least a cross-department working group

**01:03:13** gray. I'm sure they've got something going on.

**01:03:16** Oh, wow.

**01:03:16** You make it sound so exciting with your business talk.

**01:03:21** Cross-department working group.

**01:03:23** Oh boy.

**01:03:24** I did choose particularly the worst sounding at least sexy

**01:03:28** name for this but probably what is the most likely of what is

**01:03:32** actually occurring here.

**01:03:35** This episode of cortex is brought to you by ExpressVPN.

**01:03:39** There are tons of VPN providers out there.

**01:03:40** I bet you've heard a few of them and some of you may have

**01:03:42** even used the VPN before but there's a reason I use ExpressVPN

**01:03:46** and why we have them as a sponsor on their show.

**01:03:49** It's because they're that good.

**01:03:50** Here's why ExpressVPN doesn't log your data.

**01:03:53** Other VPNs can make money by selling your data to ad companies.

**01:03:57** ExpressVPN developed a technology called trusted server

**01:04:00** that actually makes it impossible for their servers to

**01:04:02** log any of your information because all the data is stored

**01:04:06** in RAM. Second is speed.

**01:05:27** Okay, let me show you my home screen.

**01:05:29** Okay.

**01:05:31** So I can see oh, is this the home screen?

**01:05:34** Yeah, this is the home screen.

**01:05:36** What would you think I sent you?

**01:05:37** I thought it was the today view.

**01:05:40** No, I have the today view.

**01:05:41** I can send you the today view.

**01:05:43** Yeah, I want all of them.

**01:05:44** Okay, right because I need to be able to to view them the

**01:05:48** way that I sent them right now.

**01:05:50** And yes, I understand what you want.

**01:05:52** Those are the only two screens.

**01:05:55** Well, there's another screen because I can see I know there's

**01:05:57** a dot but that the dot has just been where I've been like a

**01:06:00** place to put widgets that I want to try but there's nothing

**01:06:02** really on that screen.

**01:06:03** It's just like so I don't mess up the home screen.

**01:06:05** There's okay.

**01:06:06** These are the only two actual screens which is my home screen

**01:06:09** and the today view and these are the widgets that I'm currently

**01:06:13** running on those.

**01:06:14** I will say yeah by and large.

**01:06:18** This is exactly what I was expecting.

**01:06:21** Okay, you were expecting a 100% widget II world.

**01:06:24** I was expecting no apps on your home screen and that's what

**01:06:28** we've got but we have four widgets.

**01:06:33** The reason it surprised me which is because it's like the

**01:06:35** batteries widget.

**01:06:38** I'm surprised that's on your home screen.

**01:06:41** Yeah, that's why I for some reason just immediately assumed

**01:06:46** that it was the today view.

**01:06:48** Also, I have to say like the other thing that really confused

**01:06:51** me and I'm going to say it now.

**01:06:52** I cannot believe how much color is on this screen.

**01:06:54** I it is a pink to blue gradient.

**01:06:58** And I think that really threw me for a minute.

**01:07:02** What's that?

**01:07:02** Why?

**01:07:03** What do you mean?

**01:07:04** That's just not a very at that this you know, if I basically

**01:07:08** if somebody just opened links and went to this one first,

**01:07:11** they would assume that this was my home screen.

**01:07:13** I think look, I'm just living the outrun life and sometimes

**01:07:17** you just want to change and it looks cool.

**01:07:19** It looks great.

**01:07:20** Like I love it, right?

**01:07:22** But it's just a surprise to me.

**01:07:24** It actually like it partly was I think that you said, okay,

**01:07:28** this is going to sound really weird.

**01:07:30** But so my home screen was just black before and it put the

**01:07:34** widgets on and especially in the beginning all of the widgets

**01:07:38** are like, oh, hey, it's dark mode.

**01:07:39** We're going to be black and there were also just fewer options

**01:07:43** as I was playing around with things.

**01:07:45** There's a weird way in which the black widgets on the black

**01:07:49** background, I thought just look terrible.

**01:07:51** It somehow made the whole phone seem even darker and we and

**01:07:56** inconsistently dark.

**01:07:57** I just didn't like it.

**01:07:58** So I was I was looking around for something.

**01:07:59** It was like, let me try something that's more colorful

**01:08:01** and I just stumbled upon this.

**01:08:03** But yeah, so I'm with you totally that widget designers

**01:08:07** need to have options to set the background colors separately

**01:08:11** from whatever the system mode is.

**01:08:13** I get why over the summer when everybody was working on it,

**01:08:16** this wouldn't have crossed anybody's mind like, oh, I'll

**01:08:18** just have it follow the system setting.

**01:08:20** But the moment you start to use them, you realize even if

**01:08:24** my phone is in dark mode, it does not mean that I want the

**01:08:28** home screen to be in dark mode.

**01:08:31** And I just think like that's a distinction that people

**01:08:33** haven't considered.

**01:08:34** What I really want at makers to do is to offer lots of options,

**01:08:39** but at the bare minimum, considering you've probably already

**01:08:43** made light and dark, at least let me choose between those.

**01:08:46** Yes, and then maybe later we can talk about different colors.

**01:08:50** Right.

**01:08:50** But immediately just let me choose between light and dark.

**01:08:54** Yeah, so I was just looking for a brighter wallpaper because I

**01:08:57** felt like if I've got to have all of these black rectangles on

**01:09:00** my screen, I feel like I have to lighten it up elsewhere.

**01:09:03** I do have the battery widget on because the main thing has been

**01:09:07** like my, it's an easy way to keep an eye on the watch battery

**01:09:12** for me to just be like, okay, when do I need to just top it

**01:09:15** up if I'm sitting at my desk?

**01:09:16** And also the, I really like having a sense of the headphone

**01:09:20** batteries as well.

**01:09:21** Yep.

**01:09:21** So I find it useful enough that I do like having it right there

**01:09:26** on the home screen.

**01:09:27** It's like I agree with all of that, right?

**01:09:28** Like I'd like to know that information.

**01:09:30** I just don't like to know it so much that I would give it such

**01:09:34** prominence.

**01:09:36** Yeah, yeah, I do.

**01:09:37** I don't know.

**01:09:37** I just, I want to see, I want to see the circles.

**01:09:39** I like them and I like, you know, it's like, oh, they're charged.

**01:09:42** And, uh, I was really surprised when it worked with my Sony

**01:09:45** wireless headphones of like, Oh, this will, it'll show the

**01:09:47** battery for this as well.

**01:09:48** Like that's fantastic.

**01:09:49** I just assumed that would only work with Apple devices.

**01:09:52** Nope.

**01:09:52** It works with some other stuff that connects to the phone.

**01:09:55** I've been surprised like not everything, but some things.

**01:09:58** I guess maybe if it uses a certain type of Bluetooth or whatever,

**01:10:01** like, or it can report that information back to the system.

**01:10:04** Yeah.

**01:10:04** So it's, I like it there.

**01:10:05** I'm also using the Carrot weather the same way that you are.

**01:10:08** It's, you know, absolutely fantastic.

**01:10:11** So are you using the small version of the forecast?

**01:10:14** Yes, I'm using the small version of the forecast there.

**01:10:17** And again, Carrot can never be more impressed, but they do just

**01:10:22** such a good job of figuring out like when to flip over into

**01:10:25** a different mode.

**01:10:26** I really like that.

**01:10:27** Like I said this before, I'll say it again.

**01:10:29** I mean, we've loaded them with enough praise and stuff, so

**01:10:31** but I'm going to do it again.

**01:10:32** I genuinely think it's one of the very best iOS apps ever made.

**01:10:35** And like it is in a very small category of apps that I would

**01:10:39** consider in that and Carrot weather is, is 100% one of them.

**01:10:44** Yeah, for sure.

**01:10:45** Then just like what I have is, is Timery at the top, which is

**01:10:48** showing me the, how much time have you logged on, on various

**01:10:51** things.

**01:10:52** I do like the little bar graph and then I have Fantastic

**01:10:55** Cal at the bottom of here's the items that are on your schedule

**01:10:58** for the day.

**01:10:58** And so yeah, I like this as the home screen.

**01:11:01** I was, I was asking about your, your feeling about widgets

**01:11:03** because I've like, I've never been more unsettled and, and

**01:11:09** uncertain about home screen setups.

**01:11:12** Oh, I have had this and I still am a little, but over the last

**01:11:17** maybe week, I kind of crystallized on a bit, which it helped

**01:11:21** of OmniFocus adding theirs.

**01:11:22** Cause I was really waiting on that.

**01:11:24** Yeah.

**01:11:24** OmniFocus is, is the real, like, let's see what happens one.

**01:11:28** And so I've kind of gotten to a bit more comfort, like comfort

**01:11:32** with it, but I do still feel like my home screen is in flux

**01:11:37** depending on what other widgets may or may not appear and what,

**01:11:41** so like there is definitely this, this feeling of unease with

**01:11:45** it, but where I am with it right now, I like it a lot, but I

**01:11:49** can certainly understand it, especially because of the route

**01:11:52** that you have taken on the home screen here of just like no

**01:11:55** apps for widgets.

**01:11:56** You have no stacks, right?

**01:11:58** They were just single widgets.

**01:12:00** Yeah, they're basically single widgets.

**01:12:01** The Fantastic Cal one is sitting on top of the like automatic

**01:12:05** Siri shortcuts thing, but that is gone.

**01:12:08** Like I just, I just didn't happen to get rid of it today.

**01:12:10** But it's like this prediction algorithm is not good enough

**01:12:13** to take up this much real estate on my home screen.

**01:12:15** Is that what shows you the applications?

**01:12:17** Right?

**01:12:18** It's like a one that's like the eighth grid of apps, two by

**01:12:20** four of apps.

**01:12:21** No, no, no, no, no.

**01:12:22** It's, it's the Siri suggestion one.

**01:12:24** Oh, it's their version of like, what does it think you want

**01:12:27** to do?

**01:12:28** And it tries to automatically recommend either your shortcuts

**01:12:32** or anything in the whole system that plugs into shortcuts.

**01:12:35** And my experience is like, you're guessing is too terrible

**01:12:38** on this.

**01:12:38** Like it's, it's not good enough.

**01:12:40** Whatever system Apple uses for this is really good at guessing

**01:12:43** what app I want when I go to the search field, but terrible

**01:12:46** or anything else.

**01:12:48** Yeah, that's why I was, I was shocked at how bad it was.

**01:12:51** And I kept thinking like, oh, it must just need some time to

**01:12:53** calibrate was like, no, it doesn't.

**01:12:55** It's not doing well here.

**01:12:56** And I cannot understand how it can do so well at guessing apps

**01:12:59** and so poorly at shortcuts, especially because like just

**01:13:02** mentally running it through with like, oh, hey guys, guess what?

**01:13:06** It's 6 30 in the morning.

**01:13:08** I'm going to run a timer.

**01:13:09** I've just finished my boot up timer.

**01:13:11** Guess what timer it's going to be like it's going to be the

**01:13:14** starting writing timer like it is every time at this time.

**01:13:18** Like, how can you not know that it's been two weeks of doing

**01:13:21** this every day and they're like, do you, would you like to

**01:13:23** check the weather now?

**01:13:24** Like, no, I wouldn't carrot is right above you.

**01:13:27** You morons.

**01:13:28** Like, why would I check the weather?

**01:13:30** So anyway, the yes, there's technically a stack, but no,

**01:13:33** there isn't really.

**01:13:34** I'm surprised that you are still using the folders there at the

**01:13:40** bottom.

**01:13:42** Okay.

**01:13:42** Yeah.

**01:13:42** So, all right.

**01:13:43** So the, the folders at the bottom were, were my like, what's going

**01:13:47** to happen here?

**01:13:48** And so I used to have four folders and the way that I'm using the

**01:13:53** folders is, is actually just, I would like to have all of the

**01:13:58** badges for certain kinds of things in one spot.

**01:14:02** It's a grouping, right?

**01:14:03** So the one that had to go was I had a generic other grouping and

**01:14:08** I was like, well, I really want at least one shortcut that I can

**01:14:13** always just hit on the home screen, which is my generic shortcut

**01:14:16** to like launch every other shortcut, you know, menu system

**01:14:19** that I built for myself.

**01:14:20** So I can just go like tap, tap, enter to OmniFocus, you know, or

**01:14:24** tap, tap, tap, invoke a template for all the actions for the

**01:14:27** next cortex, like whatever.

**01:14:28** So like that little rocket ship launcher there is my like, you

**01:14:32** can pry that out of my cold, dead hands.

**01:14:34** Like I will never give that up, but it meant I only have four slots

**01:14:37** on the bottom.

**01:14:37** So I had to get rid of one of the folders, but the other three

**01:14:40** folders are like the first one on the left is basically OmniFocus

**01:14:44** and reminders.

**01:14:45** Like it's all of the task notifications.

**01:14:48** The second one is mostly iMessage.

**01:14:52** It's like social notifications.

**01:14:54** And then the third one is like Slack messages and a couple of

**01:14:59** other like important work related messages.

**01:15:01** So those are the way I'm like grouping things together into

**01:15:04** those three.

**01:15:05** So they're not really folders.

**01:15:08** It's just like, how can I collect these things together?

**01:15:11** And then everything else like whoosh away into the app library

**01:15:14** you go and I never look at it.

**01:15:17** Like I just never ever look at the app library.

**01:15:19** I do everything from searching.

**01:15:22** I don't love it.

**01:15:22** I like the, the asymmetry sort of bothers me that it's like

**01:15:25** three folders and the launcher, but there's no way around it.

**01:15:30** Like I can't make it look better.

**01:15:32** I don't want to compress two of those categories into one.

**01:15:38** Like I, I could compress maybe like work in tasks or social

**01:15:45** and work into one and then put the rocket launcher in the

**01:15:47** center and it would look significantly better.

**01:15:50** But I don't, I don't think I can genuinely do that because I

**01:15:53** wouldn't like the ambiguity and what the tasks are.

**01:15:55** It's that little notifications trick, which is a thing that

**01:15:59** you stumbled upon for yourself and are now kind of boxed into

**01:16:02** it because there's no way to replicate that any other way.

**01:16:06** Like this idea of like multiple applications can have the

**01:16:09** notifications, but they get bundled together and shown to

**01:16:11** you as a group on the folder.

**01:16:15** Yeah.

**01:16:15** So the only way to do it is to collapse three down into two.

**01:16:19** And I just don't like the, there's no version of those combinations,

**01:16:23** which is great.

**01:16:24** Like social and work would be the best, but it's, you know, it's

**01:16:29** still not fantastic because like there's a big distinction between,

**01:16:33** you know, there's a message on Slack I should look at and like

**01:16:36** there's a text from my wife.

**01:16:37** Like I don't really want to combine those two into one little area and

**01:16:40** then be like, Oh, I wonder which one it is.

**01:16:42** Part of the whole point is like, I don't have to wonder what

**01:16:44** the notifications are, but yeah.

**01:16:46** So like, I feel very in flux about this design.

**01:16:51** Overall, I'm very happy with widgets.

**01:16:55** I think perhaps my main frustration, and I don't know if this is, if this

**01:17:00** is related to like the tools developers have or whatever, but I feel

**01:17:04** like a lot of the widgets, they take up a lot of space and their information

**01:17:10** density is very low and so lots of the widgets, I feel like, come on, you

**01:17:15** can put, you could put more on here.

**01:17:17** Like even the timer re widget up at the top, like, okay, I don't really

**01:17:22** care about the total track time.

**01:17:24** Like you can, you could show me the total track time and you could fit

**01:17:27** in what's the current running timer.

**01:17:29** Like almost all of the widgets, I feel like you could, you could

**01:17:32** squeeze something else here.

**01:17:34** Like the fantastic how one at the bottom, you can see like this basically

**01:17:38** is half of it is totally wasted space.

**01:17:40** Like there's nothing that's being used there.

**01:17:43** I just find that as a, like a recurring frustration with a lot of the

**01:17:45** widget design, but I have a suspicion that maybe it's to do with the tools

**01:17:50** Apple has given developers, but I don't, you know, I just don't know.

**01:17:53** But I think overall it's definitely a net win.

**01:17:57** And then right now my, the today view exists almost entirely as like a

**01:18:05** legacy tool at this point.

**01:18:07** Yeah.

**01:18:07** Cause the old widgets can be there.

**01:18:09** Yeah.

**01:18:09** The old widgets can be there.

**01:18:10** What's keeping you on Cal zones?

**01:18:12** The thing that is keeping me on Cal zones is that it did not occur to me.

**01:18:15** Until you showed me your home screen that I could reproduce this in widget

**01:18:19** Smith, which I just totally will do.

**01:18:21** So I was like, that's what I was double checking.

**01:18:24** There's, there's no particular reason.

**01:18:25** I just, it didn't cross my mind that I could do it that way.

**01:18:29** And you don't even have to have the guilt of leaving behind an app that your

**01:18:32** friend made cause your friend made the upper app.

**01:18:34** That's exactly it.

**01:18:35** Right.

**01:18:36** There's this other thing of like, Oh, if you're showing off your home screens,

**01:18:39** there's also a big difference of like, and I'm not using underscores app anymore.

**01:18:43** Right.

**01:18:44** But it's like, Oh no, that's fine.

**01:18:45** I don't have this problem this time.

**01:18:46** Like I can, I'm keeping the same.

**01:18:48** And now you guys use like underscores favorite child, right?

**01:18:52** Yes, exactly.

**01:18:54** So Cal zones, I'll switch over.

**01:18:56** OmniFocus is also there because I'm not on the OmniFocus beta.

**01:18:58** So I, I, I wanted that there.

**01:19:00** The only thing though, that I do wonder is on the today view, I do use this

**01:19:08** widget to tap, like to check off OmniFocus options quite a lot.

**01:19:13** You're not going to have the option anymore.

**01:19:15** Okay.

**01:19:15** So the old legacy widget doesn't even exist anymore in the new beta.

**01:19:19** In the beta, they actually have kept the legacy widget.

**01:19:22** Okay.

**01:19:22** I haven't seen any other application do this.

**01:19:26** So I don't know if you're allowed to, or if they've just made the decision

**01:19:31** that other apps aren't making.

**01:19:33** Um, I'm not really sure what the deal is there.

**01:19:35** I don't know if you can keep them both, but of all of the apps that I've used,

**01:19:39** it is the only app that I have installed that has remained with the old one as well.

**01:19:44** So I actually don't know what the situation is there.

**01:19:47** And I also can't speak to if they will keep it around.

**01:19:50** Right.

**01:19:51** Right.

**01:19:51** Right.

**01:19:52** Of course.

**01:19:53** The reason I was just thinking about that, it's like if I had the option to

**01:19:55** keep the OmniFocus one there, I might.

**01:19:57** Oh, actually Cara has got the old one there as well.

**01:20:00** So I think maybe this is a thing that developers can, can do.

**01:20:04** Uh, personally, I'm just trying to get used to not having them because that,

**01:20:09** you know, they're going to go eventually.

**01:20:11** Yeah.

**01:20:11** Yeah.

**01:20:12** Of course.

**01:20:12** It's, it's like, you know, we're playing a game of hangman that they're all going

**01:20:16** to lose with every time there's any change in the operating system for sure.

**01:20:20** I think the only other reason I was thinking that the today view is, is kind

**01:20:23** of nice is the ability to slide over, you know, without like having to open the

**01:20:27** phone properly, which is why I also have the widget there for just checking like

**01:20:32** what is the current timer that's running without having to go to the home screen.

**01:20:35** That's another reason why I do have some duplication, like at the calendar and

**01:20:38** stuff, because I can grab that straight from the lock screen.

**01:20:41** Yeah.

**01:20:42** So one of the things I've been doing a lot, which is I really mostly quite

**01:20:46** like is I've been slowly making sure to convert all of my shortcut timers into

**01:20:53** being like things that I can say to Siri.

**01:20:57** And so like, I can just say track this track that and like the timer just

**01:21:01** runs and it all runs from my phone.

**01:21:03** And I've slowly built up a system.

**01:21:05** So like there's a little notification that shows like, yes, this is the

**01:21:08** timer running, but every once in a while I do have that moment of like,

**01:21:11** did you really do that Siri?

**01:21:13** I don't know if you did.

**01:21:13** And so I just want to be able to quickly like swipe over onto the today

**01:21:17** screen and see like, yes, the Cortex prep timer is running.

**01:21:21** Yeah.

**01:21:21** That's one of the things that I have there.

**01:21:22** So I was really happy actually, cause I didn't think it was possible that there

**01:21:26** is a live running timer on the widget.

**01:21:28** Yes.

**01:21:29** Yeah.

**01:21:30** That's one of the only things that Apple enabled of like, this is a constant

**01:21:34** because everything else just updates on a schedule that the developer can try

**01:21:38** and set, but the system ultimately decides.

**01:21:40** Ah, interesting.

**01:21:41** Okay.

**01:21:42** But they kept like count up and count down as a live element

**01:21:46** that you could have on widgets.

**01:21:48** Oh, thank goodness.

**01:21:48** Because yes, the time tracking is one of like the main things.

**01:21:52** I would have been like broken if there wasn't a way for that to work of like,

**01:21:56** you know, like every 10 minutes it updates.

**01:21:58** It's like, no, this isn't useful.

**01:22:00** You've, you've made this very, very bad.

**01:22:02** When I tell Siri to track whatever I wanted, like I'm almost always

**01:22:07** checking within five seconds from like, did that run?

**01:22:11** And I wouldn't want to have that be in every 10 minutes kind of thing.

**01:22:14** So I will say as a timer, you've done a very, very good job of watching out for the system.

**01:22:21** So like, I, my understanding is not very easy to do, like that.

**01:22:25** I can use shortcuts to start a timer and the time re widget picks it up.

**01:22:32** Uh, okay.

**01:22:32** So it's looking for a system.

**01:22:33** Yeah, that is a, my understanding at least is that is a non-trivial thing to, to make

**01:22:38** that work seamlessly.

**01:22:39** And I know from the beta that like it took a bit, right?

**01:22:42** Like for the developer to get that right.

**01:22:46** Um, also like trying to notice when other devices are updating it as well.

**01:22:50** It also does a good job of that, which again, my understanding is not an easy thing to do.

**01:22:55** Like if I start a timer on my iPhone, is it picked up by my iPad?

**01:22:59** So yeah, when I say about like favorite apps, I mentioned it earlier, time raise one of them.

**01:23:04** Actually, let's not get into this because state of the apps is coming too.

**01:23:07** We're doing state of the app so soon.

**01:23:08** Don't start doing a rundown of like your favorite apps.

**01:23:10** Home screen, screen crimes and state of the apps.

**01:23:13** Only one episode madness around here.

**01:23:15** What are we doing?

**01:23:17** But yeah, so I don't know.

**01:23:19** I just feel like I feel uncertain with a lot of this and you know, most of the time

**01:23:27** when we do this episode, I'm like, here's the home screen.

**01:23:30** I've been rocking it for a while and I love it.

**01:23:33** And I think this is also just a side effect of clearly lots of people were caught off

**01:23:37** guard by the widget stuff.

**01:23:40** And so tons of my apps are slowly rolling out like, Hey, we've got a widget.

**01:23:44** We've got a widget.

**01:23:45** It is also worth remembering that developers did have significantly less time to make

**01:23:51** enhancements this year.

**01:23:52** Well, yeah.

**01:23:52** Cause iOS 14 is released tomorrow.

**01:23:55** This is my favorite thing I've seen in Apple keynote in a really long time.

**01:23:59** I literally laughed out loud.

**01:24:02** It was like, Tim, you crazy maniac.

**01:24:08** You complain over the summer.

**01:24:10** Yeah.

**01:24:10** I loved it because it was also like, Oh, Hey, just, uh, FYI, IOS 14 tomorrow.

**01:24:15** Bye.

**01:24:16** And he walked off stage.

**01:24:18** I was like, that's amazing.

**01:24:20** People will remember this in the development community for 20 years.

**01:24:23** Yeah.

**01:24:24** This is one of those things that will always be brought up.

**01:24:26** You remember that time when I was 14, we had less than 24 hours notice.

**01:24:30** Yeah.

**01:24:31** I was like, that's amazing.

**01:24:32** You know, and here I was like sitting, dupe dupe, like I haven't run the betas and

**01:24:36** like, Oh great.

**01:24:37** I just get the whole thing tomorrow.

**01:24:38** Amazing.

**01:24:39** But yeah.

**01:24:40** So like, I feel like I'm doing just way more playing around and because of like

**01:24:46** the information density thing, I feel like I still keep swapping a lot of this.

**01:24:53** Up of like, should I do it this way?

**01:24:55** Should I do it that way?

**01:24:56** I don't know, but I do think I'll probably still land ultimately on like two

**01:25:06** screens in this way, like the today screen for stuff to check that I don't need, like

**01:25:12** running on the home screen the whole time and a more like home screen.

**01:25:18** Information board of like, here are the things that you actually do want to be

**01:25:23** reminded of all the time when you open up the home screen, like you want to know if

**01:25:26** your batteries are running low.

**01:25:28** You want to know if it's raining outside.

**01:25:30** You want to know if you forgot that cortex is recording today, uh, despite

**01:25:35** Mike's constant reminders and you want to know if you're being like just

**01:25:40** unreasonably lazy and your unintentionally timer has been running for the last two

**01:25:45** hours and now it's the most frequent thing that you've done in the day.

**01:25:48** Like I feel like that's a relatively good mental divide, like check an

**01:25:54** information board, but I'm very, very uncertain.

**01:25:58** This episode of cortex is brought to you by Squarespace.

**01:27:46** FM Squarespace, make your next move, make your next website.

**01:27:51** New iPhone time, kind of, kind of.

**01:27:54** What do you mean?

**01:27:54** What do you mean?

**01:27:55** Kind of.

**01:27:55** Well, we know when we know about them, but it's mid October and depending on

**01:28:01** the phone, if you want, it's like over a month until you can get it.

**01:28:05** Right.

**01:28:05** But this is notable, I guess for multiple reasons, really.

**01:28:09** There are now four iPhones in three different sizes, depending on the

**01:28:14** phone that you want, I guess you get some different features, but it's mostly the

**01:28:18** same, they all have OLED screens now.

**01:28:21** They all have a new design, which is flat sides as the design.

**01:28:27** Can we just pause right there and say, please Apple, these round edges.

**01:28:34** Let's never do this again.

**01:28:35** I think you're good for a while at least, right?

**01:28:38** Because they've clearly decided this is the root, right?

**01:28:41** And I think when Apple makes a decision like this, which is like, well, now they

**01:28:45** have three different product lines that have this flat edge design.

**01:28:51** We had the iPad pro, the new iPad air, and now all the iPhones.

**01:28:56** The rumor is the iMac is going to look like this too.

**01:28:59** I think you're good for a while with flat edges, honestly.

**01:29:02** Yeah.

**01:29:02** I hope so.

**01:29:03** Like I am with you on this, but I just always worry that four years from now,

**01:29:08** they'll be like, you know, it would be cool to have a phone with round edges and

**01:29:13** be like, guys, no, we've done this before.

**01:29:15** These soap phones are terrible ideas.

**01:29:18** When I saw that they had the flat edges, I was like, oh, thank the Lord in

**01:29:22** heaven above, like I have a phone that I can hold with my monkey paw.

**01:29:26** Like yeah, a flat edge.

**01:29:28** Don't give me the round edges.

**01:29:30** Like round edges from what was it?

**01:29:32** Six onward was just awful.

**01:29:34** And I hated them every year and it just, they made cases mandatory.

**01:29:38** And now it feels like, Oh, it's a phone.

**01:29:40** I can hold it with my hands without having to have a case on it.

**01:29:43** So I'm thrilled about the flat edges.

**01:29:45** Like I could not be, this is one of my favorite features.

**01:29:48** So like top three flat edges.

**01:29:50** We'll see.

**01:29:51** I mean, like we haven't held them yet, right?

**01:29:53** Like we don't know what they're going to, I mean, like my assumption is

**01:29:55** they'll feel good to hold, but again, like the sizing of them is different.

**01:29:59** Right.

**01:29:59** Yeah.

**01:30:00** They were flat edges when these phones could very easily fit in one hand.

**01:30:04** And most of these phones, I think all except one of them doesn't really anymore.

**01:30:08** Right.

**01:30:09** And even the smallest one is bigger than the phones were back then.

**01:30:13** I understand.

**01:30:14** But unless they're making the sides out of a frictionless material, I just, I

**01:30:19** can't conceive of any way that the flat edges aren't going to be easier to grip,

**01:30:25** to pick up less droppable, or even, even just little things like how,

**01:30:29** Oh, Hey, you know, it's nice sometimes being able to set your phone on an edge

**01:30:32** to take a picture when you walk away, right?

**01:30:34** Like couldn't do it with those around edges, like flam all over the phone would go.

**01:30:38** So three thumbs up to flat edges for me.

**01:30:41** That's my, that's my rating.

**01:30:43** Back to the old gray rating scale.

**01:30:46** New colors.

**01:30:47** So in the pro line, we have blue and gold, and there is red, blue, black, white,

**01:30:54** and green in the regular line.

**01:30:57** Better cameras across the board.

**01:30:59** Um, I will say that the camera stuff is tag confusing.

**01:31:04** Essentially there are better improvements for all of the phones, but depending on

**01:31:07** which phone you want, you may get more or less improvements.

**01:31:10** Yeah.

**01:31:11** I also feel like Apple intentionally a little bit seemed to obfuscate some of

**01:31:16** the, in their original presentation, like was very unclear about which

**01:31:22** phones have which features and I went back later and I was watching their

**01:31:26** little summary of the iPhone thing.

**01:31:28** And I had to screenshot the like two seconds where they actually show you

**01:31:32** what the real differences are and be like, okay, let me really compare this

**01:31:36** because your comparison page on your website is worthless for all the

**01:31:39** information that I actually want to know about what's the difference between

**01:31:43** the lenses and the sensors and everything else.

**01:31:46** Um, so I think, I feel like there was, there was a little bit of like,

**01:31:50** don't look too closely at this.

**01:31:52** Yeah.

**01:31:52** It's, it's definitely, um, tricky to nail down some of the camera stuff.

**01:31:57** Like what I know is that the pro max has a vastly better camera because

**01:32:03** they detailed that way more.

**01:32:05** And it seems like for the other cameras, there are improvements.

**01:32:08** I think mostly in the regular lens, right?

**01:32:13** Like what they call, what's called the wide lens, but it's the regular lens.

**01:32:16** Why they call it a wide lens is maddening the normal lens.

**01:32:18** Yeah, I hate that.

**01:32:20** Yeah.

**01:32:20** And there's software improvements, right?

**01:32:22** So like night mode can be done on any lens now and stuff like that.

**01:32:26** But the pro max gets LIDAR, which apparently helps with focusing in low light

**01:32:31** and enables portrait mode in night mode.

**01:32:34** But it also has more zoom on the telephoto goes to 2.5.

**01:32:39** It has a better main camera with a much larger sensor, which will make better low

**01:32:44** light and basically means indoor photography is better.

**01:32:48** And there's a new stabilization system on the main camera as well, which is more

**01:32:53** akin to the way that a DSLR is stable where instead of just stabilizing the

**01:32:58** lens, they also stabilize the camera sensor itself.

**01:33:02** Yeah.

**01:33:02** That was one of those things.

**01:33:03** As soon as they said it, I thought, I'm sure there are technical reasons

**01:33:06** why it didn't happen before, but this seems like obviously the better path to go.

**01:33:12** Don't try to stabilize the lens, stabilize the sensor.

**01:33:15** I mean, which is why good expensive cameras do this, right?

**01:33:18** But I think it's a like miniaturization.

**01:33:22** Technical challenge and physical size of phone problem.

**01:33:26** Because this is the biggest iPhone ever made.

**01:33:28** The screen is massive in the pro max, but it's not physically that much larger than

**01:33:33** the pro max it replaces, but it's a little bit larger, but they, the screen is larger.

**01:33:38** They made the borders smaller.

**01:33:40** I will say these phones, I think all look fantastic.

**01:33:43** Like the visuals doesn't look fantastic.

**01:33:45** I am very into the gold.

**01:33:48** I was, I was going to ask if you have a color preference here.

**01:33:51** I thought I was going to be all in on blue, but the, when they showed the gold

**01:33:56** stainless steel rails, I was like, Oh no, that's the one for me.

**01:34:02** Wait, gold stainless steel rails.

**01:34:04** What do you mean the rails?

**01:34:05** Yes.

**01:34:06** You know the outside of the phone, right?

**01:34:08** They, they color match it to the phone.

**01:34:10** Oh, okay.

**01:34:11** I see what you mean.

**01:34:12** Yeah.

**01:34:12** That does look pretty good.

**01:34:14** The gold stainless steel, I think looks fantastic.

**01:34:18** So gold is going to be what I'm going for.

**01:34:20** Obviously I'm going for the larger phone.

**01:34:22** I was going to say, there's no way you're not going for the iPhone pro max.

**01:34:27** Pro max.

**01:34:27** Right.

**01:34:27** Like for sure.

**01:34:28** I mean, I think, so, you know, I was like wondering, I was like, Oh, I'll see what

**01:34:32** they've got.

**01:34:32** Right.

**01:34:32** Like maybe I'll change who knows.

**01:34:34** Right.

**01:34:35** Because I was, I was, and I, and I remain a little bit concerned about the screen

**01:34:38** continuing to get bigger, right?

**01:34:40** Like it's not a lot bigger, but it is bigger.

**01:34:43** And I think that maybe the current phone is like the maximum at which it feels even

**01:34:49** remotely comfortable to use in one hand.

**01:34:51** And like that phone continuing to get bigger at now 6.7 inches diagonally might be like,

**01:35:00** I think we've passed the point, right?

**01:35:03** Right.

**01:35:03** Where it's, where it's comfortable to use, but they have done for the pro max what they

**01:35:08** did for the original plus phones in them.

**01:35:11** They have made that phone tangibly better in one of the most important ways an iPhone

**01:35:16** can get better, which is the camera.

**01:35:18** Yeah.

**01:35:19** And I'm really pleased about that because I think that's what this phone deserves.

**01:35:23** It is the most expensive.

**01:35:24** It is the most inconvenient because it's so physically large.

**01:35:28** Continue to make that worth my while outside of screen and battery life improvements.

**01:35:35** Right.

**01:35:35** Like put more cool technology in this thing.

**01:35:38** And I am super excited to try out these cameras.

**01:35:42** Yeah.

**01:35:43** I was just just looking around like, you know, like it's see just tons of people

**01:35:47** complaining about like, Oh, the bigger phone has the better camera.

**01:35:52** But I just, I just think people are thinking about it the wrong way.

**01:35:56** Cause it's like, you know, guys, I agree with you that there should be this

**01:36:00** differentiation, but it's not for the purpose of product differentiation.

**01:36:06** It's like, look guys, if they make the pro max and the pro have the same camera,

**01:36:13** it's not because they have decided to not differentiate.

**01:36:18** It's because they have decided to not take advantage of the larger space that

**01:36:23** they have, which means that the pro max has a worse camera than it theoretically

**01:36:28** could, but you will always be able to make a better camera with more space.

**01:36:35** And if you don't like it, take it up with physics.

**01:36:38** Like that's where, that's where your complaint department has to be.

**01:36:42** And what, you know, someone, people are like, Oh, I want the better

**01:36:45** camera on the smaller front.

**01:36:46** It's like, it is never going to happen.

**01:36:48** You have to wait, right?

**01:36:49** Yeah.

**01:36:50** In a couple of years, probably they will find a way to do the sensor

**01:36:53** shift on the smaller phone.

**01:36:55** Yeah.

**01:36:55** Because again, it's like the reason they've been able to do it now is because

**01:36:58** they can make the technology small enough, give them enough time at enough

**01:37:01** scale, Apple will work out, shrink it down.

**01:37:03** History has shunned this.

**01:37:04** They do these wild things and they end up making the cameras way better again.

**01:37:08** But I agree with, I am super pleased that they are once again, taken advantage of

**01:37:12** the canvas that they have in the phone being massive using that physical

**01:37:17** size to the advantage of the phone.

**01:37:19** Like you can fit more in the case, do more with it.

**01:37:23** So I'm, what are you leaning towards?

**01:37:26** Cause for me, like I was like, I thought that you might want the better camera,

**01:37:30** but I could also imagine you being intrigued by the mini.

**01:37:37** Oh, Mike, I have never been more torn in my whole life of iPhone buying.

**01:37:45** No exaggeration.

**01:37:46** I am genuinely finding this a gut wrenching decision.

**01:37:51** Like I can't decide and I keep going between all three phones.

**01:37:58** And, and so it's like, God, do I love the idea of the 12 mini, right?

**01:38:05** I love it.

**01:38:06** Uh, actually I really love the blue on the 12 mini.

**01:38:09** I actually think the blue on the mini is nicer than the blue on the pro.

**01:38:14** Yeah.

**01:38:14** I, I, it is the only time I have found myself really pulled to buy a phone

**01:38:22** that is not black.

**01:38:24** I do like the, I do like the Pacific blue on, on the pros.

**01:38:27** The black, like the graphite looks terrible in the images.

**01:38:32** Oh, I haven't even looked at it.

**01:38:33** It's like, it looks brown.

**01:38:34** It's very weird.

**01:38:35** Oh yeah.

**01:38:36** You're right.

**01:38:36** It does look terrible black because they've changed it now.

**01:38:38** It's now called graphite.

**01:38:39** Like the watch.

**01:38:40** Oh, we're not in space anymore.

**01:38:43** Space gray, a color name that makes just as much sense as space orange.

**01:38:47** Like, have you guys looked at space and they gave up on the 25 million

**01:38:51** different color options that has been space gray over time.

**01:38:55** I'm sure someone's done it, but there's got to be a fantastic infographic of

**01:38:58** like what Apple thinks space gray is.

**01:39:00** And like here's 70 versions of gray.

**01:39:02** It's like, it's always infuriating.

**01:39:05** Like I hated everything about space orange, by the way, we may have to make

**01:39:09** like some kind of cortex brand product in space.

**01:39:13** Let's do it.

**01:39:14** Let's do it for sure.

**01:39:17** But yeah.

**01:39:18** So, so the mini, the blue, I think it looks fantastic and I've always been

**01:39:23** pulled by the smaller phones.

**01:39:25** Like I just, like, I just really like the idea of the smaller phone.

**01:39:29** But so then here's where I was like, I was really looking at the camera differences

**01:39:36** and having done some professional photography in the past, you know, just

**01:39:41** like trying to look at the actual specs of it, like, okay, this is what this means.

**01:39:45** And like the differences in the pro max are very significant.

**01:39:50** Like this, the sensor size thing is huge.

**01:39:54** Sensor size doesn't just matter in low light.

**01:39:56** Like it matters for every image you take.

**01:39:59** Stabilization is also one of those things.

**01:40:01** Like you can never get enough stabilization, especially if you're

**01:40:05** doing any kind of video, you know, so I was looking at those pro max things.

**01:40:09** I was like, this camera is a lot better.

**01:40:12** And I've, I've always said that the only thing Apple needs to say every year to

**01:40:18** get me to upgrade is the two words, better camera as like, that's it.

**01:40:23** If you change nothing else, but you make the camera better, I will give you

**01:40:26** money for a new phone, like it's a totally done deal, but God damn, I feel

**01:40:31** like I know I will be unhappy with the size of that phone.

**01:40:34** Yeah.

**01:40:35** I didn't like the size of the max before.

**01:40:38** It's like, I could tolerate it, but I always found it annoying.

**01:40:41** And the pro max is a lot bigger, but being a little bigger is like,

**01:40:47** I don't love it.

**01:40:47** I don't know if you know this and I'm not going to make it any easier for you

**01:40:51** in telling you this, but the 12 mini is smaller than the iPhone.

**01:40:54** I see the currency.

**01:40:55** Oh God damn it.

**01:40:58** Okay.

**01:40:59** That's that's infuriating.

**01:41:00** This is also, I have never more wanted to see the phones in person, but also like

**01:41:07** if there's any place like crawling with people in central London is like, I am

**01:41:12** not going into an Apple store in central freaking London, like that is not happening.

**01:41:16** So yeah, like I'm, I'm totally drawn towards the mini.

**01:41:19** Like that is the phone.

**01:41:20** The blue mini is the phone I want to buy.

**01:41:23** There is no question about that.

**01:41:26** However, there's two problems.

**01:41:28** One is a possible problem and one is an actual problem.

**01:41:31** The possible problem is Apple's really poor track record of keeping

**01:41:37** the small phone updated frequently.

**01:41:41** You are not going to have a problem with this.

**01:41:43** You, I don't think that's the case this time, but I'm just bringing it up because

**01:41:48** it's something in the back of my mind of like, look, I am happy to get on the

**01:41:53** small phone train, as long as this train is pulling out of the station and going

**01:42:00** down the line and so like, okay, if there's going to be another small phone

**01:42:04** next year that has a better camera, I'm happy to just like pretend and be two

**01:42:10** years behind the top of the line camera technology.

**01:42:14** Like I would totally do that, but they don't have a great track record.

**01:42:17** I agree.

**01:42:19** I suspect they're going to sell a lot of these iPhone minis.

**01:42:22** Like, I think this is good.

**01:42:23** They're going to sell a bazillion of these.

**01:42:25** It could potentially be the best selling model.

**01:42:28** Yeah.

**01:42:29** Yeah.

**01:42:29** I think that's very possible.

**01:42:31** So that's why I say that is a theoretical problem.

**01:42:33** The one that really puts a dagger straight through my heart is that the second lens

**01:42:40** is the super wide angle lens.

**01:42:42** It's not the telephoto lens.

**01:42:43** Yeah.

**01:42:44** Yeah.

**01:42:44** Yeah.

**01:42:45** And that is brutal.

**01:42:47** Like that is so brutal.

**01:42:48** And that's the one that's really hard to get past because I use the wide angle,

**01:42:54** the super wide angle.

**01:42:55** Occasionally it's nice to have, but you know, I could totally do without it.

**01:43:01** The telephoto lens is the one where it's like giving that up is really hard and

**01:43:07** is going to be a constant frustration.

**01:43:09** Uh, like I don't have the telephoto lens.

**01:43:12** I get why they did it because in the computational photography stuff, I can

**01:43:16** easily understand how the super wide is the lens to have if you're combining

**01:43:22** information from the two lenses.

**01:43:24** Like that just that perfectly makes sense.

**01:43:27** I get it.

**01:43:28** And also you can fake a zoom.

**01:43:30** Yeah.

**01:43:30** Yeah.

**01:43:31** To most people's satisfaction, you can fake a zoom.

**01:43:34** So like, yeah, that's the good asterisk, but yes.

**01:43:37** Yeah.

**01:43:38** Like cropping isn't zoom.

**01:43:39** Digital zoom is not a thing.

**01:43:41** People digital zoom is a lie.

**01:43:43** Just move.

**01:43:46** So, so that is the part that just kills me.

**01:43:50** Like it really kills me is the lack of the telephoto lens.

**01:43:53** And so then I think, well, why don't I just go with the, the 12 pro?

**01:43:59** It's like the camera is better than my current camera.

**01:44:02** Not like amazingly better, but it is better.

**01:44:06** But then, then here's the problem, like iPhone 12 pro is the iPhone of compromise.

**01:44:13** And you know what the thing about compromise is everybody's unhappy or you,

**01:44:18** if you're an individual, you're unhappy in both directions.

**01:44:22** So I know if I get the iPhone 12 pro, I'm going to both think this phone could be

**01:44:27** smaller and it could have a better camera.

**01:44:32** Yeah.

**01:44:32** The middle one is not the right one.

**01:44:34** Cause you're right.

**01:44:35** You're not benefiting from either of the things, which is even making you question

**01:44:39** which phone to get anyway.

**01:44:41** Exactly.

**01:44:42** Right.

**01:44:42** So like the, the iPhone 12 pro is, is like, this is, this is the phone of compromise.

**01:44:48** And there's, there's plenty of times in life when compromise is the correct solution.

**01:44:52** And this may well be the time when it is a correct solution, which is why I'm saying

**01:44:58** I'm genuinely frustrated between all three options.

**01:45:02** But so then with the iPhone 12 pro it's like, okay, well I want the better camera.

**01:45:05** So why don't I just like min max the actual thing that I want?

**01:45:11** It's like, do I want the better camera?

**01:45:14** I really, really do.

**01:45:16** Do I want to be carrying around a phone that was bigger than the phone that I

**01:45:20** already found uncomfortably big to carry around?

**01:45:23** I really don't.

**01:45:24** And so then I'm like, well, maybe I'll get the mini.

**01:45:26** It's like, but I know if I get the mini, I'm going to constantly miss the telephoto

**01:45:29** lens.

**01:45:30** Like it's really going to be annoying.

**01:45:31** And you know, so like that area, of course.

**01:45:33** Yeah.

**01:45:34** It's like, okay, well, so then I should compromise and I should get the 12 pro.

**01:45:37** It's like, oh, but the 12 pro doesn't maximize and either of the characteristics

**01:45:40** that you want.

**01:45:41** So like, well, why don't you get the better camera?

**01:45:43** Okay.

**01:45:43** I'll get the better camera, but then it's going to be like, I just keep going

**01:45:46** around and around and around.

**01:45:48** And I like, I cannot decide.

**01:45:50** I really cannot decide this year and it's gut wrenching.

**01:45:54** Luckily you do have a little bit more time to decide because both of those phones

**01:45:59** go on pre-order at the same time, which is not until the sixth of November.

**01:46:05** Yeah.

**01:46:06** Yeah.

**01:46:06** But I just, I don't know what I'm going to do.

**01:46:08** I don't know what I'm going to do.

**01:46:09** And I thought after the presentation, it was going to be a much easier call, but

**01:46:15** like the more I dug into the details, the harder a decision it came to be.

**01:46:19** And so I don't know.

**01:46:22** Anyone who was on the fence before you screwed.

**01:46:28** What do you mean?

**01:46:30** Anybody who was on the fence of the phone sizes, this presentation

**01:46:34** has made everything way worse.

**01:46:36** Yeah.

**01:46:37** Because now like there are vastly different phones, like plus the, the

**01:46:41** fact that the 12 pro and the 12 are the same size now and the 12 pro is bigger

**01:46:50** than the 11 pro.

**01:46:52** Yeah.

**01:46:52** So if you were already unhappy, then you're going to be really unhappy, right?

**01:46:58** Like if you were, cause I know a lot of people felt like the 11 pro was too big.

**01:47:02** And then the 12 pro is now bigger.

**01:47:05** So now you have to decide, do I want to go to the mini and give up features

**01:47:09** because you're losing stuff like the other camera and stuff like that.

**01:47:13** Or do I get a phone that's bigger or do I get a phone that's even bigger if I'm

**01:47:17** already going to go bigger?

**01:47:19** Yeah.

**01:47:19** It's, it's definitely tricky.

**01:47:21** I personally think this is the best lineup Apple's had for a long time, if not ever,

**01:47:28** because there is tangible choice and they're comparable, right?

**01:47:33** Like the fact that Apple makes a phone as small as the iPhone 12 mini, and it has an

**01:47:38** A14 chip in it and two excellent cameras and 5g and face ID and the mag safe, which

**01:47:43** we'll get to in a minute and the new ceramic shield, strong glass.

**01:47:47** Like this is what people wanted the iPhone SE 2B, right?

**01:47:53** Which is like a non-compromised small phone.

**01:47:57** Yeah.

**01:47:58** So it's absolutely excellent that they've made that.

**01:48:01** But for people that are looking to upgrade from a phone of the last two years, the

**01:48:06** choice, the choice is difficult for people.

**01:48:09** Yeah.

**01:48:10** Yeah.

**01:48:10** I'll, I'll agree from a, uh, you know, you're in charge of the, of product

**01:48:14** lineup at Apple or whatever.

**01:48:16** It's a very good product lineup and it's not quite, but it makes me think of that

**01:48:21** old, like four quadrant.

**01:48:24** Yeah.

**01:48:24** The four quadrant chart of like, you've got the pro and you've got the consumer and

**01:48:28** you've got good and you've got better.

**01:48:30** And it's like, I think that is a very good model for like, what is your product lineup?

**01:48:35** So I think, yes, it's the names are still a little, like a little off, but it's fine.

**01:48:39** Like you're, they, they've had, they have a sensible selection of phones, but it's

**01:48:46** just, it's for me personally, it's, it's gut wrenching.

**01:48:50** Like it really, really is.

**01:48:53** And I can't even, I can't even come to the conclusion of like, well, you know,

**01:48:58** which one, which one do I just order?

**01:49:00** Even if I'm trying to frame it of like, just to try it, right?

**01:49:04** Which one is I still can't even make the decision of, of, of that.

**01:49:07** And, and yeah, the, the, you're right.

**01:49:10** The additional complication here that the iPhone 12 pro is a little bigger is also

**01:49:17** really throwing me because it feels like, Oof, I don't want this phone to be any

**01:49:22** bigger, but I can see that it would make sense of like, it might be more tolerable

**01:49:27** to deal with a phone that's significantly bigger than one that is just.

**01:49:31** Annoyingly bigger.

**01:49:33** Right.

**01:49:33** So it's, it's, it's brutal.

**01:49:35** I can't, I don't know.

**01:49:36** I don't know what I'm going to do.

**01:49:40** How cool is that mag safe though?

**01:49:42** The mag safe is very cool.

**01:49:43** Um, the mag safe is very cool.

**01:49:46** I don't like the name because it feels like Apple's rubbing a little thumb in

**01:49:51** your eye about like, Hey, remember mag safe, like a, a perhaps defining

**01:49:56** invention from Apple that has saved my laptops many times that we replaced with

**01:50:01** USB-C, like we're bringing it back, but we're not.

**01:50:05** Well, you know, I hope they do eventually.

**01:50:07** It could be a bold new world in Apple Silicon.

**01:50:10** Yeah.

**01:50:10** I mean, I guess, I guess maybe for something like the smallest laptop,

**01:50:14** they could have a 20 watt charger.

**01:50:16** I said the fact that they have brought it back or all puts more chance of them

**01:50:22** bringing it back to the laptop.

**01:50:25** Yeah, maybe.

**01:50:26** I don't think it's going to happen, but it's, I feel like it's more possible now

**01:50:32** that this exists than if it would have never existed.

**01:50:35** Yeah.

**01:50:36** I think they're just recycling the name.

**01:50:37** I don't think we're going to get laptop chargers that are mag safe.

**01:50:40** Oh, they're definitely recycling the name, but the fact that the name exists again

**01:50:44** means that Apple believes in the technology again.

**01:50:47** I reckon it'll probably just be USB-C, but nevertheless, it's nice to dream.

**01:50:51** Yeah, but it is.

**01:50:52** It's very cool.

**01:50:53** That clear case that shows you where to put the mag safe is one of the

**01:50:56** fuggliest things I've seen Apple produce in a long time.

**01:50:59** It is ridiculous.

**01:51:00** Like it has a magnifying glass on the back.

**01:51:03** It's terrible.

**01:51:04** It like, it made me think of the iPhone case that had all the holes on the back

**01:51:08** that said hun when it went over the iPhone thing.

**01:51:12** It was like, like who designed that?

**01:51:14** It was just awful.

**01:51:15** Like guys, just, just combine those three circles on the bottom and it would say

**01:51:18** iPhone nice and neatly centered.

**01:51:21** Like, I don't know what you were doing.

**01:51:22** But no, the mag safe looks totally awesome.

**01:51:25** That looks like a really, really nice feature.

**01:51:27** I'm glad that they're upping the wattage a little bit, like slowly, slowly chipping

**01:51:32** away at one of the biggest problems about wireless charging, which is just the slow

**01:51:36** speed.

**01:51:36** Well, I guess they've done too, right?

**01:51:38** That it's, it's faster with the mag safe.

**01:51:41** It was 15 watt, but also now like it aligns properly because there's magnets.

**01:51:47** So it's easier to get the lining correct.

**01:51:49** Yeah.

**01:51:49** No, it's, it's, it's very, it's very cool looking.

**01:51:52** The other thing, of course, I'm sure you had the exact same thought that I did as

**01:51:56** soon as you saw that, that wallet, which was like, maybe we could put some kind of

**01:52:01** hook on the back of the phone here.

**01:52:04** You know, some kind of little gripper, especially if say I was going to have a

**01:52:08** big phone, like a little, a little ring or something that could pop out of the back.

**01:52:14** It's like almost like a socket, which you could pop.

**01:52:17** Cause I was like, I saw this and was like, ah, you see, they're making wireless

**01:52:20** charging more appealing to me now than it has been before.

**01:52:25** But I can't wireless charge because I am a pop socket guy.

**01:52:28** And if the phones get in bigger still, I definitely need my pop socket.

**01:52:33** I can't get rid of that.

**01:52:34** And then pop socket did announce after the event that they will have mag safe

**01:52:39** compatible pop sockets when that's going to happen.

**01:52:43** I don't know.

**01:52:44** I reckon we'll be like six months away from that, but I like the idea of this as

**01:52:49** a possibility in the future still though, that like, and, and I think a lot of

**01:52:53** questions like how strong is the magnet?

**01:52:56** Is it actually going to hold?

**01:52:58** Right?

**01:52:58** Like that's, that's what I'm not sure of.

**01:53:00** I mean, I assume it's strong enough, but I don't know how strong.

**01:53:02** So yeah, I'm, I'm keen.

**01:53:04** I'm keen to see what will happen there.

**01:53:06** But the mag safe thing is it's clever.

**01:53:08** I'm genuinely pleased that Apple have opened it up for third

**01:53:11** parties to make products that it's not just a thing that they make.

**01:53:15** You know, obviously you have to, I'm sure go through some kind of

**01:53:18** certification with them or whatever, blah, blah, blah, but you know, I think

**01:53:21** it's cool that there will be other options.

**01:53:23** And I think as a wireless charging thing, this is much better than

**01:53:27** what Apple had done previously.

**01:53:29** Yeah.

**01:53:30** It looks pretty cool in my dream fantasy land.

**01:53:33** Apple would make something that's like a pass through charger.

**01:53:36** That's also a gripper for the back of your phone.

**01:53:38** Like I don't know if that would be technically possible, but that's,

**01:53:41** that's what I would totally love.

**01:53:44** And again, if you're listening, Apple, I don't care how few watts get through.

**01:53:49** Right.

**01:53:50** If, if, you know, you're trying to charge at 20 and only five make it through the

**01:53:54** pass through gripper charger, that's fine.

**01:53:56** I can live with that.

**01:53:57** You know, that that's, that's the thing that I'd be looking for.

**01:54:00** I'm just going to put this side by side comparison to the three phones to the

**01:54:04** side of my screen and bring back up our show notes for more text time.

**01:54:09** And I'm just, I'm just going to have all three of them looking at me the whole time.

**01:54:12** I figured that windows probably going to remain open on your desktop for quite a

**01:54:16** while.

**01:54:17** Yeah.

**01:54:17** But my brain and eyes literally bounce like pro max pro mini pro max pro.

**01:54:29** Ooh, I think you should go with the pro max.

**01:54:36** Pro max is the option for the head.

**01:54:39** Mini is the option for the hearts.

**01:54:41** Because the reason I think is you've, you've, you already have this phone.

**01:54:45** It's not like you're jumping up from the regular one.

**01:54:47** And so you're used to dealing with a phone of this size for all of its

**01:54:51** frustrations, but this phone is a better version of the new one than the current

**01:54:56** one, because the current one is just a big version of the small, the smaller phone.

**01:55:00** It doesn't have anything else except a bigger battery.

**01:55:03** But like, it's just, if you took the phone and dragged it diagonally, right?

**01:55:08** In Photoshop, that's the 11 pro max.

**01:55:11** Right.

**01:55:11** But the 12 pro max at least has what I think is like the functionality to

**01:55:17** warrant it being called max.

**01:55:19** Yeah, no, I, yeah, I agree that that's the whole dilemma is like it's, it, it has

**01:55:24** the features that, that make it worthwhile.

**01:55:26** That's why I think it isn't a dilemma.

**01:55:28** I think you should just stay on the train that you've been on, get the 12 pro max

**01:55:32** and benefit from the better camera.

**01:55:34** Yeah.

**01:55:34** You're just trying to get me to join your plus club.

**01:55:36** That's all you're trying to do here.

**01:55:37** You're already in the club.

**01:55:38** No, I left.

**01:55:40** Plus you've left a bunch of times.

**01:55:45** And I may leave again.
