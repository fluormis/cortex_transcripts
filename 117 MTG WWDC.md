# Cortex - 117: MTG WWDC
**00:00:00** WWDC week. WWDC week. Is it still, because we're recording on Saturday, is it still going or is it

**00:00:06** fully over now? It ended Friday. Like Friday is when Apple's thing ends. You know, there's always

**00:00:11** a lot of overhang. There's things going on probably into next week. I still feel like I've

**00:00:16** barely dug into a lot of the stuff. This year was more of a success from a how I'm feeling standpoint.

**00:00:23** Yeah. Not as busy, better planned, really. Which part of the reason we're recording this on Saturday,

**00:00:27** like I've, I spread my week out pretty nicely. So I was only ever recording one thing per day.

**00:00:34** That is much better than last year. Last year was very rough for you. Yeah. The biggest change

**00:00:40** for me this year was moving like non-essential things. I could just like regular things out of

**00:00:46** this week and that's made things a lot better. And it's actually, I just think it's been very

**00:00:50** helpful because I've also had more time this week to watch some session videos and dig into

**00:00:57** some of the beta stuff. So Monday was rough, but like that was just the way it was going to be.

**00:01:03** Right. It's just super late recording. I published upgrade at hop us two in the morning

**00:01:07** and then was awake until hop us four, which was just wild. Your, your upgrade WWDC recording

**00:01:15** schedule day on Monday. My thoughts are with you that day, Mike, cause I know it is a late night

**00:01:20** for you doing the recording and the editing to turn that show around real fast. It's brutal.

**00:01:25** People ask me like, why do you publish it that day? Like, why not just go to sleep and do it

**00:01:30** the next day or whatever? And sometimes I find, especially with creative work, there are, there

**00:01:36** are reasons to do things. And sometimes those reasons mean you end up working really late. And

**00:01:41** for me, I want to not only have our show out on the day of the keynote, I kind of want it to be

**00:01:49** first. And so I will burn the candle at every possible end to get it out that day. Cause that's

**00:01:57** just important to me. I think most people probably don't care about it as much as I do, but I do just

**00:02:04** really care. It's important to me. It's important to me that we have that episode out on Monday.

**00:02:08** It's just a thing. Like I just want to do that. It's like a little commitment that I have to

**00:02:12** myself. Yeah. Like I don't think you're wrong. I think this is the way different projects are

**00:02:20** different, right? Which is obvious to say, but if you take that idea seriously, it means you make

**00:02:25** very different decisions for different sorts of things. And so I imagine on the spectrum of

**00:02:29** projects that you work on, Cortex is relatively untime sensitive, which is why we make a lot of

**00:02:36** different sorts of decisions about Cortex upgrade is way more time sensitive. And particularly the

**00:02:44** WWDC episode is the most time sensitive episode in a more time sensitive show.

**00:02:49** Because when we recorded, so like I always say this, I say this about every show that I've made.

**00:02:54** I've said it on the show a bunch of times. I don't like recorded content just sitting somewhere from

**00:02:59** the moment that I press stop on any show, including this one, the clock has started ticking. It's

**00:03:05** getting old and the longer I leave it until I release it, the worse I feel about it with

**00:03:10** especially WWDC. The content is getting old immediately because there's so much more

**00:03:18** information that is coming out after the keynotes and people are digging through web pages. They're

**00:03:23** downloading the baits on their phones. They're like finding out little details that if I recorded

**00:03:29** that, because our thing is we go live on the show basically as soon as the keynote ends.

**00:03:35** So if I waited and published it the next day, it's so old by that point. So it's just important to

**00:03:42** me to get it done. And yeah, we could record the show on Tuesday and that would be great. And

**00:03:47** in some ways it would be better. In some ways it would be worse because it wouldn't have that kind

**00:03:52** of excited energy that we have because we've just watched the thing. It's about what type of show

**00:03:57** you want to make. And the type of show that I want to make for that episode of Upgrade is like

**00:04:03** immediate reactions. What do we think? And then there's a spectrum of shows and it comes down to

**00:04:09** Cortex where we not only record it at the end of the week and we always have, it also doesn't come

**00:04:15** out until the week after. So by this point, I know a bunch more stuff and the types of things we talk

**00:04:21** about and the way that we talk about it, by the time we get to the show, it's completely different.

**00:04:26** And we could, in theory, could record the show on Tuesday and not release it until the next Tuesday

**00:04:33** because we want our immediate reaction. But then that's a completely different show to the one that

**00:04:36** we're making. And so that's why I will publish the show at Hapas 2 in the morning. Because the

**00:04:41** point is that we record it that day, I edit it, and then however long it takes you, so long it

**00:04:45** takes and it goes out immediately. And then I fulfilled what I wanted to.

**00:04:50** Yeah, it's like you want to maximize what things are in their good attributes. And I think I have

**00:05:01** that experience with your annual upgrade episode of, oh, it's fun to listen to, to get exactly that.

**00:05:08** What are the initial responses of two thoughtful people about what we've just heard in WWDC before

**00:05:14** all of the information comes out? Like it's a very particular experience. And so like I totally

**00:05:19** back your, like while normally with most of your shows, I would say, Mike, don't stay up that late.

**00:05:24** Like don't do that. That's dumb. You have to know under what circumstances does it make sense to

**00:05:29** break the rules? And I think with a product that is delivering that thing, the excited initial

**00:05:36** response, and also what comes along with that is a lot of the initial wonderings that people have.

**00:05:43** Ooh, is it really this way or is it that way? Like we'll find out. That has to, it just has to come

**00:05:48** out soon. So I do back your staying up until 4 30 in the morning to get it finished because then it

**00:05:54** means people like me can just listen to it the next day in the UK. And it's like, oh, great. Upgrades

**00:05:58** here immediately. Like I watched the thing late at night. I went to bed, did some work in the morning

**00:06:03** and then great afternoon break. I can find out what the initial reactions are to what happened.

**00:06:08** So as a listener, I appreciate it. But as a friend, I'm very sympathetic to knowing how much

**00:06:15** knowing what your day is like. It did result in a, in like in a piece of follow up. I had another

**00:06:19** work hangover on Tuesday. Like I wasn't just tired. I was like, I was wrecked, but I planned for it.

**00:06:27** I had nothing booked in on Tuesday. That is a very good decision. Because I knew it was going to be

**00:06:31** bad. What time did you say you were up until I was up until half past four, I published at 2 30.

**00:06:37** I was at the studio as well. I went home and I just couldn't sleep. I mean, plus, I mean,

**00:06:42** if you are slamming a rebel at 11 PM, it's going to mess you up anyway. Right. Yeah.

**00:06:49** There was one moment in the show where I ended up editing it out, but it was funny for me because

**00:06:56** I've never done this before where, you know, like when you yawn, you answer a question, like you say

**00:07:02** something when you yawn. Like I did that and I noticed myself doing it. I was like, that's bad.

**00:07:07** I was like, yeah, like that. You know, right. Oh boy. That's not good. Right. Because to the average

**00:07:15** listener, it just sounds like you're super bored as opposed to the person who understands this is

**00:07:20** happening at one in the morning, this, this back and forth. So Mike's a little sleepy. It was just

**00:07:25** funny. Like I kind of caught myself doing it as I was doing it. You know, it was just like a funny

**00:07:30** little thing to happen. But yeah, so I published that, Dave, just because I want to, it's important

**00:07:34** to me, but the content is dictated by that release and the release dictates the content.

**00:07:40** Yeah. And it totally makes sense. And I think it's also just a case of, again, you need to know when

**00:07:45** to break the rules and when, or when is it worth super pushing things on? Like not all projects

**00:07:51** are worth super pushing it on, but sometimes they are. And like, this is part of the decision-making

**00:07:57** process is realizing when does it make sense? And I agree with you that this is one of those cases

**00:08:01** where it makes sense, even though it can seem totally crazy to, uh, to people sometimes of like,

**00:08:07** geez, does it really matter if you wait a day? And it's like, yeah, for some things it does for

**00:08:11** other things, it doesn't. And this is a case where it does, but I'm also very glad to hear that you

**00:08:16** were able to plan ahead and not have anything, not have anything happened that day and just like

**00:08:22** work with that as opposed to last year, where you seemed optimistic about how many things could

**00:08:27** happen in a day because you don't need to physically be there. So it's surely going to be way easier.

**00:08:34** One of my very, very favorite iOS apps now has a Mac version,

**00:08:38** Timey. Oh. One time listeners of this show know about Timey. And I purely just wanted to mention

**00:08:44** it on the show because Joe, the developers just done such a great job. When the M1 Macs launched,

**00:08:51** I was really disappointed that the app wasn't available to download. Like I couldn't download

**00:08:55** the iPad version onto my Mac. And part of the reason for this was because Joe was working on

**00:09:00** a Mac version. So this is a catalyst version of Timey and it's fantastic. I love it. And in a

**00:09:07** really interesting way, and we'll maybe talk a little bit more about this kind of stuff later

**00:09:11** on in the show. Anyway, this is one of those instances where in building a Mac version,

**00:09:17** it's made the iPad version better. So he's added a bunch of features to the app in general because

**00:09:23** they were good for the Mac. So like it now has on iPad, like a sidebar interface, which is like

**00:09:29** something that was introduced last year at WWDC with these sidebars for iPad apps. There are more

**00:09:34** keyboard shortcuts now for the application. And also my favorite thing is you can set it so when

**00:09:39** you open a time entry, it drops like the text cursor into the description field. And if you

**00:09:44** start typing, it auto completes projects and tags based on things that you've recently set.

**00:09:51** And I really like this feature. So like if I open it and I type C-O-R, it offers me podcast

**00:09:56** recording, podcast editing, or show prep, or with the cortex tag, because there are things

**00:10:01** I've recently done. So I just, I really love this app. Joe has done such a great job bringing it to

**00:10:06** the Mac. And now I finally jettisoned the abhorrent toggle application into the moon and I will never

**00:10:13** see it again. That thing has gone from my life and I am so happy. Wow. Jettison into the moon.

**00:10:20** I hate that toggle app. The toggle Mac app is just like, I don't even know why they bothered.

**00:10:25** They should have just had an electron app based on the website. Like I just don't even know why

**00:10:30** they bother with that little toggle app. So now I have the timer app. I'm very happy to pay toggle

**00:10:35** the company forever, right? For their wonderful service that they provide. And all of the great

**00:10:40** reporting tools that I have on their website, all super good. I do not know why they make bad apps,

**00:10:46** right? For setting up the timers, but they have an API again. Thank you toggle for creating an

**00:10:51** API. I love that you did that. So then talented developers like Joe can build applications to

**00:10:57** plug into your API. Yeah. I wish more companies would follow that model of we do the core thing,

**00:11:02** but we also have an API. And so people can build stuff on top of that. I am picky clearly with my

**00:11:08** software. The toggle app for Mac does the job for so many people, but I want more out of it,

**00:11:15** you know? And that's why again, I love that they have this API. So then

**00:11:19** other developers can plug into it. But yeah, the, the Mac app, the timer Mac app is really,

**00:11:24** really great. I'm very, very, very happy that it exists now. Yeah. I literally installing it as,

**00:11:29** as we were speaking. And of course I'll almost certainly be emailing the developer with things

**00:11:35** that I want. Yeah. This was one of those. I was pretty early in the process for this one because

**00:11:41** Joe knew how badly I wanted this. So he sent me like one of the first builds. And I really love

**00:11:48** being able to, I feel very privileged that I'm in a position where I can work with some developers

**00:11:55** to get the features that I want from their applications. Yeah. And so there were just

**00:11:59** some things, especially around keyboard shortcuts and stuff where I just wanted them to work a very

**00:12:04** specific way and was able to make my case to Joe. And he implemented them that way. And I was just

**00:12:11** really thankful for it. So yeah, I like being able to have that kind of input in places. So

**00:12:16** yeah, I will have to say like, obviously I'm a very private person and I'm not a big fan of

**00:12:24** internet fame in very many ways, but I'll tell you one thing that I do love is emailing developers

**00:12:31** sometimes with the feature request and it's like the hit rate for, Oh, I listened to Cortex. Like,

**00:12:36** yeah, sure. I can add that keyboard shortcut is very high. And it's like, that is one of the few

**00:12:41** times I'm always like, okay, this is a nice, this is a nice benefit of some level of internet fame

**00:12:48** is like email, a developer probability of Cortex listener equals 90%. We need to get like some

**00:12:55** Cortex branded email addresses to double our hit rate, you know, like get like gray at Cortex and

**00:13:01** Cortex really just double that hit rate in case anyone's searching.

**00:13:05** That is not a bad idea. Yeah, that is not a bad idea at all. I may make a Cortex brand email

**00:13:10** just for emailing developers to be like, please recognize one of these words. Recognize my name,

**00:13:16** recognize the podcast title. This episode of Cortex is brought to you by Fitpod, the fitness

**00:15:13** Obviously we have loads of very interesting and important things to talk about today.

**00:15:17** Yes we do.

**00:15:18** You put a header in our show notes and I need to know more about it.

**00:15:23** The header just says, Gray gets seriously in italics back into magic.

**00:15:30** While I know what this means, there is a part of me that loves to imagine you pulling a bunny

**00:15:34** from a hat. That's like a nice little image in my brain. You mean the technically I guess

**00:15:41** trading card game but I guess it's not that anymore as well. What is magic?

**00:15:45** Oh god, I mean this is one of these things that I just don't even know where to start.

**00:15:54** Maybe we can turn to Wikipedia here, right? Let me see how Wikipedia summarizes Magic the Gathering.

**00:16:00** I'm actually quite curious, what does Wikipedia say Magic the Gathering is?

**00:16:03** Oh my god, this is a long one. Let's see how quickly I can get through this.

**00:16:06** Magic the Gathering is a tabletop and digital. That's the point I was thinking of.

**00:16:10** Collectible card game released in 1993 by Wizards of the Coast.

**00:16:14** A player in Magic takes the role of a planeswalker to battle with other players as planeswalkers

**00:16:20** by casting spells, using artifacts and summoning creatures as depicted on individual cards from

**00:16:26** their individual decks. A player defeats their opponent typically, but not always, by casting

**00:16:31** spells and attacking the creatures to do damage to the opponent's life total, with the object

**00:16:36** being to reduce it from 20 to zero. Although the original concept of the game drew heavily

**00:16:41** from the motifs of traditional fantasy role-playing games such as Dungeons and Dragons, the gameplay

**00:16:46** bears little similarity to pencil and paper adventure games while simultaneously having

**00:16:50** substantially more cards and more complex rules than many other card games.

**00:16:56** Oh I hate that description so much.

**00:16:58** It sounds like you're doing one of the most boring things imaginable.

**00:17:01** That's what it sounds like from this description.

**00:17:05** Oh my god, yeah. I mean this is... it's one of these things where... how to put this like...

**00:17:11** part of this is I can't quite remember what context this ever came up in on the show,

**00:17:16** but I remember it because H. M. Bute animated it for one of the fantastic Cortex animated segments

**00:17:23** where for some reason on some episode years ago I mentioned... we're probably talking about hobbies

**00:17:30** or something and I mentioned how I don't really have hobbies, but one of these things I've been

**00:17:34** circling around for years and years is people trying to get me back into magic. And I made an

**00:17:40** off-handed remark, look I don't want to get back into this game because I know that the only way

**00:17:45** I'm going to get back into it is if I get seriously back into it. Like there's no casual version of

**00:17:53** this. It's like I'm going to dedicate a huge amount of my mental space to this or I'm not going to do

**00:17:59** it at all. And so it was like I'm just not going to get into this. But that's why it's like well

**00:18:04** time has come around that here we are years later and through a variety of shark related events

**00:18:14** I've ended up getting back into this game and have gotten quite seriously back into this game. And

**00:18:20** I absolutely hate the description on the Wikipedia page. So like here is the meta point about this.

**00:18:27** So when you think about games, games often have these two layers and it's true for video games

**00:18:39** and it's true for board games. There is the mechanism layer of the game which is what are

**00:18:46** the rules and what happens mechanically in the game. And then the way then you sort of translate

**00:18:56** that into a more human understandable thing is that on top of the mechanisms you overlay

**00:19:03** a theme. So the Monopoly board game has a bunch of rules about how you move around the board

**00:19:12** and like what various squares do. But the theme of that game is predatory capitalism. And you can

**00:19:20** easily imagine that someone could have a game that has the exact same mechanisms where one player

**00:19:28** slowly has an edge and then grinds everybody else into the dust in an incredibly unfun way over the

**00:19:34** next two hours. But you could theme that in a totally different way. You could theme that as

**00:19:41** like medieval fantasy. You could theme that as sci-fi and have it have nothing to do with

**00:19:47** property and collecting rent. But all of the mechanisms could be exactly the same.

**00:19:53** And so the reason that I mentioned this is I think like this game magic has one of the absolute

**00:20:05** most interesting game mechanisms that is like underneath the theme. And the theme,

**00:20:13** I think that the company and the way that it works, they've done a fantastic job of once you

**00:20:20** get into it, the theme is really good, is really solid, is very strong at world building. But it is

**00:20:29** incredibly repulsive to a lot of people when you first hear it described. It does sound like the

**00:20:36** most boring and nerdiest thing that can exist in the world. So I think the like the level of

**00:20:45** getting into this game is very, very hard for lots of people. I think the theme can really bounce

**00:20:52** people off. And it doesn't also help that the mechanics of the game are hugely complicated.

**00:21:00** But when you combine both of these factors, I think it is also not surprising that in the sort

**00:21:08** of nerd and geek world, magic has loomed large for like, I don't know, 25 years, something like that.

**00:21:18** I feel like it's had this very big place in nerd culture for a long time. Similar to Dungeons and

**00:21:25** Dragons. Yeah, I do think there is something very similar to Dungeons and Dragons with that of

**00:21:31** it's complicated, it's weird, it can be hard to get into, but for the right kind of person,

**00:21:37** you can super get into it. And so sort of the short version of what happened here is

**00:21:46** I was working on my video about sharks. Sharks. Yes, thank you, Mike.

**00:21:52** I wanted to do it one time. Yeah, no, go for it. It's infectious.

**00:21:59** It is infectious. It's totally infectious. We might touch on that later, but for a bunch of

**00:22:04** reasons that don't matter now, and I probably won't ever talk about that sharks project was

**00:22:10** without doubt one of the most stressful and hard videos that I've made in years,

**00:22:15** even though it doesn't look that way. And after it was done, I just I really needed something to

**00:22:23** take my mind off the project and to just like decompress with over the next few weeks to be

**00:22:29** like, okay, I need a break from this nightmare of a project. And the timing just happened to be right

**00:22:37** that magic had recently released the sort of Mac version of their new online system.

**00:22:42** And I thought, okay, I streamed it. I was like, let me just play around with trying to

**00:22:48** relearn the rules. And as I fully expected, what started out as a just casual stream of let me let

**00:22:57** me see what the game is like. Now I haven't, you know, I haven't played it in like 20 years,

**00:23:03** turned very fast into a just complete obsession that culminated with me reaching number 681 in

**00:23:15** the world. As far as magic goes. That's a bit much. I think there's a bunch of like lucky

**00:23:22** coincidences that helped me rank that high. Do you have a sense for how big that number is? Like,

**00:23:28** out of how many? So I actually I was trying to figure this out. I couldn't log a good answer.

**00:23:35** But so so here's my estimate, like the company that owns magic, they published some estimate

**00:23:40** that they they want something like three to five million players eventually on their system. That

**00:23:45** doesn't tell you what the current numbers are. But the best that I could figure out is that there

**00:23:51** are these programs that people use as like assistance to when they're playing to help

**00:23:57** calculate some of the statistics automatically. And some of these programs report that they have

**00:24:03** hundreds of thousands of users. That's kind of what I was looking for, right? Like, I want to know,

**00:24:06** are you 681 out of 700 or are you like millions, you know, like I want it to a ballpark. Hundreds

**00:24:13** of thousands is enough to still stick with my original surprise. Yeah. And it's a rank that

**00:24:19** if I did want to pursue it, if I could maintain that rank, things run in seasons. But if I was

**00:24:25** able to hold that rank until the end of the season, like I'd get an invitation to one of

**00:24:29** their minor league pro events. There's nothing I want more than for you to do that.

**00:24:40** I do something so fun for me to imagine you as like I'm a pro gamer now.

**00:24:46** I'm very like just to be clear, I'm very specifically not aiming towards that because

**00:24:55** the moment you do well enough in the game to sub so basically like you have to be in the top 1200

**00:25:01** to get a number at all. And the company pulls from the top 1200 players to fill out their

**00:25:07** in person professional competition leagues. But it's like the moment that you have a number,

**00:25:13** I very intentionally was like, okay, this is a great accomplishment. I'm totally glad I've

**00:25:18** done it. It's also completely validated my prediction that the only way I was going to

**00:25:22** get back into this was very seriously. But also this is the moment to consciously let go and to

**00:25:30** just like, don't care about the number anymore. Cause that'll suck all of the fun out of it.

**00:25:34** You're going to keep playing, but you're not going to keep checking your ranking. Is that what you're

**00:25:37** saying? Yeah. Cool. I was concerned you were going to say that you've given up playing the game,

**00:25:41** which just seemed like you were punishing yourself. No, like I still totally want to play.

**00:25:45** Like it reminded me a little bit about when we talked about VR and I said how like VR was a

**00:25:50** really fun experience. Like I haven't had in years. I can honestly say that with magic, it's the same

**00:25:57** thing. Like there's something about it that's perfectly lined up with my brain that like I

**00:26:02** have not had fun like this in years. Like I just love it, but I also immediately recognize like

**00:26:10** the moment I was ranked, it's like, okay, you've got to just put this right out of your brain.

**00:26:14** Don't care about the rank. I played some more games after that top rank and like immediately

**00:26:20** plummeted down to 800 out of the top 1200. And it's like, that's fine. There's always a broader

**00:26:26** lesson here of anything that you do competitively or that I should say anything that humans do

**00:26:32** competitively. I think people don't appreciate the exponential level of difficulty. And so

**00:26:41** like you think about world chess champions and at a certain point, if you're a professional chess

**00:26:47** player, you have the chess system that does the rankings of like, oh, what's your, what is your

**00:26:52** score in chess? That is a shorthand for probability of winning against a player with another score.

**00:26:58** But once you get really high up into that system, that trying to beat the player who's the 500th

**00:27:05** best in the world is twice as hard at least as trying to beat the 600 best player in the world.

**00:27:13** And then also when you're ranked like that, the thing that becomes very clear, very fast is

**00:27:20** losing is brutal for the calculation of what your rank is. Like wins get you very, very small

**00:27:27** increases in like, oh, your rank is great. And a loss is like, congratulations, you've just dropped

**00:27:33** 150 rank points. And, you know, if you win three games in a row, you can go up five rank points.

**00:27:40** The statistics are in such a way that there are minute differences between the players, right?

**00:27:46** You have this weird double effect that the players are incredibly good. And that also means if you are

**00:27:54** slightly off whatever the level is in your ranking, like you're going to plummet just brutally

**00:28:01** immediately. So that's why I was like, okay, don't think about this. Don't worry about this. Like,

**00:28:07** don't actually try to set a goal of doing any better. You don't really want to qualify for like

**00:28:13** the in-person competitions. The way I basically told it to myself was like, okay, cool. You've

**00:28:17** quote, beaten the game and now you can just totally play for fun. And it doesn't matter. Like,

**00:28:23** this is the best that you're going to achieve. But it was really funny. And I did quite enjoy it

**00:28:28** because I think there is something sort of absurd about going from, oh, I haven't played in 20 years

**00:28:34** and I don't know any of the basic rules to sub 1000 ranking in the space of like three weeks.

**00:28:42** I was trying to see if I could find a leaderboard and find you on it, but I'm not having any luck.

**00:28:46** Yeah, their whole system is very strange. Yeah. I happen to have wandered into the game at a very

**00:28:51** weird point in their time where I think like a lot of companies, because of the pandemic,

**00:28:55** they tried to change the way they do competitions because obviously they can't do them. You don't

**00:29:00** want to be collecting a thousand people from all across the world into a stadium together. Like,

**00:29:06** that's bad news. So they've tried to switch to online and everything's like just totally up in

**00:29:11** the air right now. It's kind of funny because this similar thing happened to Federico. He

**00:29:16** ended up getting ranked pretty well with competitive Pokemon. Oh, interesting.

**00:29:20** Also to the point, I believe that if he would have continued down the path that he was on,

**00:29:25** he could have been in the contention to go and compete in the in-person championships if they

**00:29:30** were such a thing at the time. This kind of stuff where, oh, there's so many different areas of

**00:29:38** human activity and every one of them is completely a world unto themselves and they all have their

**00:29:45** own weirdness and their own total self-involvedness. So like part of the fun has just for me also just

**00:29:51** been trying to figure out like, what's going on in the world of magic? How do the competitions

**00:29:56** work now? What's the company doing? It's funny to just get into these whole worlds where every

**00:30:01** world has their own little celebrities and it's just totally fascinating. But yeah, so this is

**00:30:07** the perfect kind of thing that just hooked into my brain 100% at just the right time to be a nice

**00:30:16** break from a very difficult project. And so yeah, I got very seriously back into magic.

**00:30:25** What do you enjoy about the video game? Because like, you know, so I have some of a basic

**00:30:32** understanding I think of this because I used to play the Pokemon trading card game.

**00:30:37** So like, I feel like I get the rules all different stuff. But you know, like the idea of you build a

**00:30:42** deck, you have your strategy, and you want to play to the like, you know, the strengths of your deck,

**00:30:48** that kind of stuff. You have resource cards, I'm sure. I mean, I've never played magic. I don't

**00:30:52** I don't know how the game is played, but I just figured there can't be that many differences

**00:30:57** between most trading card games. And then there's just the nuances of each game, but like a basic

**00:31:01** level. But what do you enjoy about magic system? And does it translate to the video game version?

**00:31:08** Yeah, so I think as far as I can tell magic is sort of the original version of this,

**00:31:14** like the genre establishing one. Yeah, I think it is. I think every competitive trading card game

**00:31:19** draws from magic in some ways. Like, this is kind of like how I have been aware of it.

**00:31:23** From when I played Pokemon cards, which is knowing that magic existed, it was always at the same

**00:31:28** places that you would buy your Pokemon cards. And I believe, if I'm remembering rightly, that

**00:31:33** the original Pokemon card game was produced by Wizards of the Coast as well. Oh, interesting.

**00:31:38** That seems quite probable. Yeah, so if I want to try to describe abstractly what is going on and

**00:31:46** what is interesting and what is fun, there's a couple of key features here. So I think there's

**00:31:54** something that in particular video games do, but that magic hits really well is I think

**00:32:02** asymmetry in games is super fun and very hard to pull off. And so what I mean by asymmetry here is

**00:32:13** if you think about chess, actually, I don't know, do you play chess, Mike? Or do you know the rules?

**00:32:18** I have played chess. I don't think I'm good at chess, but I've played chess. Yeah.

**00:32:22** Well, I know I'm bad at chess, actually, but I played it.

**00:32:25** Yeah, don't worry. I'm right there with you. Like I never got super into chess. But chess is,

**00:32:31** to me, the world's most perfect example of a symmetrical game. Both players start out with

**00:32:38** the exact same pieces. And it's also perfectly symmetrical because at all times you know what

**00:32:47** the other person is doing. It's all right there totally on the board. Whereas if you take a game

**00:32:54** like poker, it's still very symmetrical, but it's a little bit less because you don't know what the

**00:33:01** other person has for sure. But you do know they have cards in their hands. You know what ones you

**00:33:07** have. So you know what they don't. Yeah, you have, you know what cards they can't have because you

**00:33:13** are holding them and you can make some reasonable guesses. And I personally find that as you turn

**00:33:19** up the asymmetry dial, games become more interesting. But the reason most games don't

**00:33:26** do that is it's incredibly hard to balance a game where the players are more and more

**00:33:33** asymmetrical. You may or may not be familiar with it, but I feel like Starcraft 2 is a video game

**00:33:38** that's often held up as like the pinnacle of game asymmetry where there's three very different

**00:33:44** sides with very different strengths, but they're well balanced. So it never feels like, oh,

**00:33:50** this one way to play is the best way to play. And I just think magic may be the most asymmetrical

**00:33:56** game that has ever been created because you are each playing with your deck of cards.

**00:34:04** And very abstractly, the idea is you want to use your cards in a better way than the other player

**00:34:11** uses their cards, but you just don't have any idea what the other person is playing in their hand.

**00:34:19** And the thing about magic, which I think is unique compared to other games, is the number of cards

**00:34:27** are enormous. There's a limited version of the game and the limited version has 2000 possible

**00:34:36** different cards that a player can use, which is already quite a large number for someone to even

**00:34:43** be familiar with. We need to talk about setting limits here. I think that's a good limit. What do

**00:34:49** you mean? 2000 is a big limit. That's a lot still. So that is considered the limited game. That is

**00:34:55** the version of the game where it's like, oh, hey, have you not played magic in 20 years? You should

**00:35:01** start with limited. There's only 2000 cards to become familiar with. If you want to play the

**00:35:08** historic version of the game, which means like all cards, that is 20,000 different cards.

**00:35:18** Right. So when I'd say like asymmetrical, if you are playing a historic game,

**00:35:24** even if you have played for years, it is still possible to be playing against someone and they

**00:35:30** use a card that you go, I've never seen that card. Like I didn't even know that thing existed.

**00:35:38** Yeah. So, but I think that makes a game super interesting. And when I was a kid, I played magic

**00:35:45** a little bit like, you know, with kids in the neighborhood or a little bit, you know, with some

**00:35:49** kids at school who played magic. But one of the reasons I got super back into this is because I

**00:35:55** think the online version amps this up to 11 because when you're playing your friends in real life,

**00:36:03** you have some concept of, Oh, what cards might they use or how does this person like to play?

**00:36:09** But when you're playing online and you just get randomly assigned some person, you have no idea,

**00:36:15** like, what do they like to play? What cards might they have? What strategy might they be

**00:36:19** trying to proceed? Interesting. I guess the online version gives everyone the ability to play what

**00:36:26** otherwise would have been competitive play. What do you mean by that? Because people going to

**00:36:31** competition don't know their opponents. Yes, exactly. Most of the time, right? And as you're

**00:36:35** saying, like, if you were playing as a kid, you were playing against your friends. And so eventually,

**00:36:41** you not only would learn how they played, if you played a lot, you would learn what they had. Yes.

**00:36:47** And your friends would if they got something new, they'd probably tell you it anyway, right? Yes,

**00:36:51** exactly. About the new card that they have. But in playing online, you know, it's like randomly

**00:36:56** assigned people, you have no idea what their strategy is or what cards they own. And if you

**00:37:01** pick him from a pool of 20,000, and I guess you explain in it, like, Oh, I find interesting is,

**00:37:06** it is adding randomness to what would otherwise be assumed as a very kind of like limited game,

**00:37:13** right? Like, there's only so many things you can do in a card game and or it is just cards,

**00:37:17** right? Like, ultimately, these are cards being played. But the element of there being so many

**00:37:23** potential options that can come your way adds a different dimension to it. So I just think that

**00:37:31** makes that kind of brings this level of interest and excitement to the experience, which I think on

**00:37:38** the surface, if you did an understanding game, you would think probably didn't exist. Yeah. So like,

**00:37:43** I was trying to think about how do you explain to someone who's never played, what might this game

**00:37:47** be like? And that's why I particularly cringe at that Wikipedia description, because I feel like

**00:37:53** it puts all the nerdery right up front and gives you no indication of what might be interesting.

**00:38:00** And so like, I was trying to think about, okay, here's the best way I could describe

**00:38:06** sort of what the experience is like without actually explicitly talking about the game.

**00:38:12** So it's like, okay, imagine you were going to play chess with someone.

**00:38:15** But the way the game starts is the board is completely blank, except both of you just have

**00:38:22** your king on the board, you know, and so the basic rule of got to catch the king is in place and it's

**00:38:29** chess. But then what happens every turn is that each player adds a piece to the board.

**00:38:37** But you don't know what pieces the other player has. All of their pieces can do different things.

**00:38:44** And so there are constraints in which the game operates, but there's always these possibilities

**00:38:50** for surprise. I'm like, Oh, okay. This guy's added a piece that moves in a way that I've never seen

**00:38:57** before. And I need to deal with that. Or you can run into weird situations where like, I just don't

**00:39:04** have very many pieces. And like this other person has lots of pieces. And the thing that really gets

**00:39:11** me with the game is there are very many pieces which will change the rules about how all of the

**00:39:19** other pieces work. So again, it's a bit like, okay, not only are we just continually adding things to

**00:39:25** the board, but all of a sudden it'll be like pawns can move backwards now. Rooks can jump over

**00:39:31** pieces. These are certain cards you can play. They change the rules of the game. It's not that

**00:39:37** there's a rule change. It's a card forces the rule change. Yes. So one of the things that the game is

**00:39:43** delightful about is explicitly having cards that change the whole win conditions of the game. And

**00:39:52** that can happen at especially when you're playing against random people, it can happen at any moment.

**00:39:57** And you're like, Oh, no. Like I am not prepared for this. But that's also what makes it super fun.

**00:40:04** So there can be cards where it's like suddenly, I tend to be a very defensive player. But there can

**00:40:10** be cards that are like, if you play defensive, you will just lose in three turns. So like it forces

**00:40:15** you to suddenly play very differently from the way that you intend to play. And I think that can be

**00:40:21** super interesting. And I think you can without a doubt, make an argument that magic is the most

**00:40:29** complicated game that humans have made. Because with all of these cards and all of their interactions,

**00:40:40** the possibilities can just totally explode of like, what can occur in a game. And the thing that is

**00:40:49** is like a great example of this is that the magic game is Turing complete, which means you can

**00:40:58** simulate an entire computer just by the interactions of the rules of the cards. Many games are Turing

**00:41:05** complete. Like we discussed Minecraft a couple of episodes ago. And you know, oh, right. The Redstone

**00:41:11** stuff in Minecraft lets you build computers. Like that's the computery stuff inside of it. Or if you

**00:41:18** play Factorio, it's like, oh, right, there's red and green wires. And that's all the computery stuff.

**00:41:24** But those games explicitly added elements that were there to add computer programery stuff

**00:41:32** into them. Whereas the magic Turing complete stuff is totally unintentional. Like the game designers

**00:41:41** never intended to say, oh, people should be able to simulate arbitrary computing functions within

**00:41:47** our game. No, they just made so many cards with so many rules and so many weird edge cases

**00:41:55** that they accidentally built a system where someone can build a computer out of their cards,

**00:42:01** which to me is hilarious. I don't even understand what that really means. Like I can't get my head

**00:42:06** around that. You've really broken me. I mean, I'm sure you've seen this stuff in Minecraft where

**00:42:14** someone builds the Minecraft game inside Minecraft. I've seen like, you know, like full video games

**00:42:20** inside of Minecraft. Yeah, I've seen that kind of stuff, but it's a computer game. So I understand

**00:42:24** how you can make a computer out of it. Right, right. This is what I mean. But like, so with

**00:42:28** the magic, the gathering cards, it gets to the question of like, what is a computer? And a computer

**00:42:34** means you need to have a certain number of ways that you can manipulate information. And I'll just

**00:42:41** leave it at the magic cards are capable of doing that. Like it would take you 100 million years,

**00:42:49** but you could with magic cards recreate the game of Minecraft that also simulates Minecraft inside

**00:42:56** of it. Right. It is like totally accidental. No, no, no, no, no, no, don't get that. You did it again.

**00:43:04** You like brought it to a point where I was like, Oh, I think I'm getting it. And then you pulled the

**00:43:08** rug out from a minute. I'll put a link to a guy made a video about it that's based on a computer

**00:43:14** science paper that some total geniuses wrote that I read through and was like, Oh my God,

**00:43:18** my brain hurts so much, but this is also so cool where they just prove that magic, the gathering

**00:43:23** is Turing complete. But what I just mean to show by that is the variance of what can happen in a game

**00:43:31** is incredibly high and you can just constantly run into things where it's like, I've never seen that

**00:43:36** before or wow, I just lost in three minutes in a way that I didn't even know was possible. That's

**00:43:42** so cool. If someone has watched my videos, I think it can be pretty clear that there is a part of me

**00:43:51** which really enjoys figuring things out and trying to figure out like what are the rules of this

**00:43:57** complicated system? And that's why I have known for years that this is a game that if I ever got

**00:44:04** back into it, like I just would not be able to let it go because it's just perfectly designed

**00:44:10** for exactly this kind of thing of it's an incredibly complicated system,

**00:44:18** but it is also an understandable system. If you can put enough time into it, it's just that the

**00:44:24** variance in difference is incredibly high. How do you collect the cards in the virtual game?

**00:44:30** They do the same kind of thing that a lot of these companies do where there are virtual packs

**00:44:34** that you can buy. You can also do it just as like a free to play player depending on how much time

**00:44:39** you want to put in, but you can just buy packs and then you have cards. I mean, people always

**00:44:44** complain about the way companies run things, but I think they have done some very clever things with

**00:44:49** how do you get cards that are rarer by having sort of like a wild card system where it's like, oh,

**00:44:55** you haven't gotten a card, but you can trade this in for a card of equivalent rarity if you haven't

**00:45:01** just gotten it by randomly purchasing the packs. I just want to do like we talked before about

**00:45:06** developers knowing the show. I just have to do a little shout out to, I don't know if any of the

**00:45:12** programmers who work on the magic system listen to the podcast, but if they do, I just want to say,

**00:45:18** I think those guys must be total heroes for trying to program this into a game system because the

**00:45:28** thing that is difficult to explain here is, and this is one of the things that I like about the

**00:45:33** game, is it's a little bit like edge case the game. So one of the things that's super fun is you try to

**00:45:41** find combinations of cards that were never intended to work together, but can work together

**00:45:49** in a very strange way and then use that to win. But it means that like pro, I cannot conceive of

**00:45:59** what a programming nightmare this must be to try to make. It's also why this has been like a

**00:46:05** multi-year project for the company and they are not remotely close to replicating all 20,000 cards

**00:46:11** in their system. Like they are adding old ones as fast as they can, but it's like, oh my god,

**00:46:17** I genuinely mean it that it may be one of the most pain in the ass programming jobs on the face of

**00:46:23** the earth to try to add in the old magic cards because all of them just constantly change the

**00:46:28** rules about how the game works and debugging that must be a complete nightmare. You know when your

**00:46:35** computer freezes up, like you get the spinny beach ball, and sometimes you may wonder like,

**00:46:41** why doesn't the operating system just quit this program that we know is frozen? Right? Like the

**00:46:49** computer's given me the spinny beach ball. So it knows something's wrong. Right. It knows something's

**00:46:53** up. Like why do I have to be the one who force quits the program? And the answer to that is this

**00:47:00** is what's known as the halting problem in computer science where, sorry computer scientists if I

**00:47:05** butcher this a little bit, but the gist is you cannot use a computer program to determine with

**00:47:13** 100% certainty that another computer program is stuck in an infinite loop, that it's not going

**00:47:22** to work its way out of whatever problem it's stuck into. So that's why you as the human have to force

**00:47:28** quit because there's mathematically no way for the computer to know for certain. Is this program

**00:47:34** stuck forever or is it going to finish any second from now? Like you just can't know that. And it's

**00:47:41** also why sometimes you get the spinny beach ball and then you go get a cup of coffee and you come

**00:47:45** back and your computer's fine because it was just working through something that was just going to

**00:47:50** take a super long time. Well, because this card game is Turing complete, it has the exact same

**00:47:56** problem. There are lots of situations in the game that can come up where it's like, oh, is this loop

**00:48:02** just going to happen infinitely forever? It's just a stalemate. Like there's, you can get your

**00:48:07** two players and get themselves into a situation where there is no way out. Yes. And there's some

**00:48:13** really funny videos where neither player wants to hit draw, but some action has been occurring

**00:48:18** automatically for eight hours and both people refuse to be the one to like, I'm not going to

**00:48:23** log off the system and give you the win. Right. But neither player can do anything. Like a series

**00:48:28** of actions is just triggering more actions infinitely forever. Right. But the programmers

**00:48:35** can't know when that's happening. Right. So they can't like program into the rules. Oh, we know for

**00:48:41** sure. This loop is just going to go on forever. Yeah. So we can declare it. It could just be

**00:48:46** playing really slowly or whatever. Right. Like, yeah. You can't even do it by time. Yes. I guess

**00:48:52** you can't do it by time elapsed. So that's one of the reasons why like very few games would have

**00:48:59** this sort of property and also the sort of nerds who are attracted to this game love to set up that

**00:49:06** kind of nonsense. Right. Like, oh, let me try to exploit it in every possible way. So I think you

**00:49:10** have both sides of it of like, this is really hard to program. And also it attracts people with

**00:49:18** programmer mindsets who are looking to exploit the system. Like that is actually explicitly

**00:49:26** part of the game is exploit the way all of these thousands of weird rules interact with each other

**00:49:34** in unexpected ways. So I just like, I cannot imagine what it's like to try to program this thing,

**00:49:40** but to to the people on the magic arena team, cheers to you. I would not want your job, but thank you

**00:51:18** memberful for their support of this show and relay FM. So it has now been two years since we launched

**00:51:25** the theme system journal. Wow. Which is quite a thing. So 2019, our WWDC 2019 episode is when we

**00:51:33** launched the journal to the world. That both feels too long and too short. That could be one of those

**00:51:39** like pandemic time weirdness things as well. Right. Or it's like, you know, it's just a strange time

**00:51:45** that we've been going through. True. So in those two years, we've sold now over 15,000 journals,

**00:51:51** which feels like a fantastic thing to say. Mm hmm. But because of various delays and supply constraints,

**00:51:59** we've sold more than half of those in 2021 alone. Right. So in the, in these past six months,

**00:52:06** we've sold more than we sold in the last year and a half before that. And now we have, I think,

**00:52:12** our supply management under control in a way. I'm feeling pretty confident about things now.

**00:52:17** I'm very confident it's all solved because I don't have to directly deal with any of this.

**00:52:22** I don't hear about these problems anymore. So I'm convinced they're solved.

**00:52:26** So for these two things coming together, like now that the product's been around for a while,

**00:52:30** we finalized basically what this product is. And now that we've got on our stock management under

**00:52:38** much more control, we're about to now launch a new thing that we've been trying to do for a while,

**00:52:43** which is subscriptions to the theme system journal. This is something that we wanted to do

**00:52:48** for a long time since like the beginning. And it's something that people said to us,

**00:52:52** hey, why don't you just launch a subscription and help with your stock management problems?

**00:52:57** The problem was it couldn't until we had a consistent and mostly reliable supply chain.

**00:53:03** Right. Yes.

**00:53:04** Which we now have been able to secure. So we are now starting an option for a quarterly rolling

**00:53:13** subscription. Now, we're kind of, especially me referring to this as kind of like a beta process.

**00:53:20** Yeah.

**00:53:20** Because we've, and this is why we are launching it in the middle of the year and not at the start

**00:53:26** of the year. So if there are things that we need to iron out, we have time to do them before what is

**00:53:31** arguably not actually not arguably definitely the focal point of a product like this, which is

**00:53:38** the end of the year, the beginning of a year. Right.

**00:53:40** Of course.

**00:53:40** So we didn't want to launch it then because that would have been madness, frankly.

**00:53:46** And also as well, we're working with our good friends at cotton bureau and we're working on

**00:53:50** this together. They have not done this before. This is the first product that they have worked

**00:53:55** on with a subscription model built into it. Big thanks to them for helping us get this worked out.

**00:54:00** Yes, definitely.

**00:54:01** This is the way that we're doing it for now. Right. And again, beta because things can change,

**00:54:05** but this is the plan. So when you subscribe, you get sent a journal immediately and you then get

**00:54:12** entered into the shipping for the next quarter's journal. So if you become a subscriber of the

**00:54:19** theme system journal at the start of every quarter, you will have a journal because it would have been

**00:54:23** delivered to you before then. So this is October 1st, January 1st, April 1st, July 1st, you will

**00:54:29** have a journal arrive with you before that point. Right. So we are going to start shipping them out

**00:54:36** a month before that date with the hope then that it will arrive with people in time.

**00:54:43** So when you go to buy at cortex, much.com, your timeline is indicated on the page. So it will say

**00:54:49** like, if you buy now, it will be shipped at this point and your next journal will be shipped at

**00:54:54** this point. Right. So one of the worst things you could do is to order between that time period.

**00:55:00** This is the thing that we're working out. Like if you ordered on like September 2nd,

**00:55:06** you might end up with a point where you might have like a week where you don't have a journal,

**00:55:10** but that's only going to happen that first time and then it will work out. And again, this is just,

**00:55:15** we're trying to work out the logistics of all this stuff, right? Like we're all new to this.

**00:55:19** Yeah. It's very like so complicated. This is why it is a beta program. And I think it's,

**00:55:24** it's very fair to say like, we definitely want feedback on this because this is again,

**00:55:30** when we first talked about this forever ago, you pitched me on the idea of subscriptions. I was

**00:55:34** like, Oh yeah, of course. Like that's, that's definitely a thing to do. And then when we

**00:55:39** finally get the logistics set and then the details come around to be like, okay, so what actually

**00:55:46** happens when someone presses buy and you realize, Oh, in my head, I had a vague, completely

**00:55:53** unthought out way that this would just be perfect. But now that we need to figure out the real

**00:55:58** details, it's harder to try to figure out what is the situation that makes everyone the happiest.

**00:56:04** The real easy way of doing this is you press buy now and you get one on October 1st.

**00:56:10** Right.

**00:56:11** But that sucks.

**00:56:12** But yeah, but that's exactly it. Like I think that's not what most people want to have happen.

**00:56:18** You want, when you press buy, your internal feeling is I have bought this. I would like

**00:56:24** this now, please. What you don't want is someone to have purchased something just after the

**00:56:30** seasonal changeover. And then they have to wait three months for the next journal to show up.

**00:56:36** Like that's a terrible experience, but this is also like, we're just testing this now because

**00:56:42** we're trying to think of what is the best way to do this. But we definitely want feedback for,

**00:56:47** okay, now that this is going to start interacting with the real world,

**00:56:51** is this what people want and expect? Like they get a journal now and then they are put onto the

**00:56:57** seasonal delivery schedule. Like we think this is the best way, but we're not 100% sure.

**00:57:04** Because it's like, it's also, you know, this is kind of like a pretty decent time to launch it.

**00:57:10** Because if you bought it now and you started using it on July 1, which is would be kind of

**00:57:15** the expectation, right? Because you start in a new quarter, especially by the time, you know,

**00:57:20** ships out to whatever, then you'll be good. You'll be golden because they last for 90 days,

**00:57:24** you should have your journal before 90 days is up. And that's it. So again,

**00:57:28** it's just like a thing that we're just trying to work out. But there is incentives to you,

**00:57:32** if you do this, by the way, this isn't just for our logistical management process.

**00:57:37** It's a few things. So not only do you make sure you have one when you want one, because

**00:57:43** this will be a thing that if we, as we're managing stock, we're keeping an eye on how many do we

**00:57:48** need at a certain point, like kind of stuff, we're making the journal cheaper for subscribers.

**00:57:53** So currently, the theme system journal is $25. If you buy it one off,

**00:57:58** quarterly subscribers get the journal for $20. And extras, as tokens of our appreciation,

**00:58:06** there will be little things included in the package that only subscribers to the

**00:58:10** Thieves Mr. Journal will get. The first ones are some stickers. The only people that are

**00:58:16** going to get these stickers are Thieves Mr. Journal subscribers. And we're going to,

**00:58:19** it's not going to, we're not going to like change the world with these, but they're just little

**00:58:23** small tokens of our appreciation that subscribers get, as well as a discount. So I think that's

**00:58:28** pretty great. And we want the feedback from people. If you do subscribe, let us know what

**00:58:32** the experience is like. And the way it will work is leading up to the point where the next payment

**00:58:38** is going to be taken. The content bureau will send you an email, they'll confirm. So if you have

**00:58:41** any changes you want to make, like maybe you moved, you can do that. It's super easy to do that. You

**00:58:46** just contact them and they'll do that. And again, we're building out a system together over time,

**00:58:50** depending on feedback. So this is like the next stage. I'm pleased that we're launching it now

**00:58:56** and not in November. I would not want to be launching this in November. No, sir.

**00:59:02** So we have like a good six months to get this like truly shored up. I subscribed because it's

**00:59:08** good for me, I suppose. Although I have just stacks of these things, but nevertheless, it's

**00:59:13** like, do you need a discount on your theme system journals? I'm pretty sure you've got like in your

**00:59:17** house right now more than enough for the rest of your life. It only applies to me and you,

**00:59:22** but if we are logged into our own account, they are free. Oh, sweet. It's only applies to me and you.

**00:59:27** But you know, cause we pay for the things already. So then not truly free. We've actually lost money

**00:59:34** by doing that, but nevertheless, don't get like a thousand of them because that's the only money

**00:59:39** out of our pockets. But yeah, so like if we're approaching a new half of the year, so if you've

**00:59:44** got a new seasonal theme that you want to work on, this could be a great time to do that. So you can

**00:59:48** go to cortex march.com. You can check out that. We also have the subtle notebook, which by the way,

**00:59:54** this idea, if it works, we could potentially look at other products to do on subscriptions too.

**01:00:01** Mm.

**01:00:02** Right. So, you know, we have the subtle notebook as well. I'm working on another product

**01:00:08** that I think people might want on a somewhat seasonal basis or on a frequent basis. So this

**01:00:14** is us trying to understand, is there a market for it? Does it make logistical sense for us

**01:00:20** and customers? And we'll see where it goes from there.

**01:00:23** Cortex merch.com.

**01:00:26** WWDC time.

**01:00:28** WWDC.

**01:00:30** I've been getting lots of people telling me that they want this episode of Cortex,

**01:00:35** that like they need to know how we feel about certain things.

**01:00:39** Oh yeah.

**01:00:41** Anything in particular that the people want to know about?

**01:00:43** I'm just going to say.

**01:00:44** Can't imagine.

**01:00:46** I don't think that we necessarily have that much of an impact on the decisions that Apple decides

**01:00:52** to make with their operating systems. However, this felt like a very Cortex WWDC.

**01:00:58** Yeah. I mean, I think we, like we can all just acknowledge right here that when Megan Frost came

**01:01:04** out with the map section of WWDC and London was the central focus of the slot.

**01:01:12** It was the one on that list.

**01:01:12** Right.

**01:01:13** London, number one on the list. Very first image that they showed on the screen was a beautiful

**01:01:19** 3D rendered London. It was like, I see you maps team. I know you're talking directly to Cortex.

**01:01:25** I get it. Message received. So yeah, for sure.

**01:01:28** Maps, a screen time API, which we were the only people asking for shortcuts on the Mac,

**01:01:35** iPad multitasking changes and effectively the entire system that you've been wanting to build

**01:01:42** with downtime, which is focus models.

**01:01:47** Now, okay. Nothing is ever going to be exactly as you want. However, you have been trying to use

**01:01:52** downtime, which is mostly a parental control feature to allow you to somewhat automate the

**01:01:59** apps that you use on your device and the notifications that you received during those periods of time.

**01:02:05** And that is effectively what Apple is also trying to do with something called focus.

**01:02:09** Yes.

**01:02:10** Now, focus is now an umbrella term that includes do not disturb. So do not disturb is now a focus

**01:02:17** mode. Right. And effectively, this allows you to build your own profiles for custom notifications

**01:02:25** and attention. So you can choose who you want to contact you, what apps you want to contact you.

**01:02:30** If there are certain apps that you want to send what quote unquote time sensitive notifications,

**01:02:36** and you can also program custom home screens that show when you have these modes enabled.

**01:02:43** I think this is really cool.

**01:02:45** Yes. Although I'll just say it now, but we're going to talk about focus modes, but don't let

**01:02:49** me forget you actually missed another cortex specific feature in this WWDC that I want to

**01:02:56** mention later. Don't let me forget that. Okay. But yeah, the focus mode thing,

**01:03:01** it seems very interesting. I've installed the developer beta on my phone. Oh, no, I've done

**01:03:09** iPad and my computer. I didn't install it on the writing computer, you know, because of course,

**01:03:15** you know, I, my heart leaps into my mouth there for a second. I just, I just wanted to let you

**01:03:19** know, right? Like don't worry, Mike, the writing computer upon which I record podcasts does not

**01:03:25** been updated computer as well as the other things that it does. Right. Writing computer is not beta

**01:03:34** operating system testing computer. I wouldn't do that to you, Mike. Don't worry. I mean,

**01:03:37** that wouldn't make any sense. Right. Why would I mean like it would not make any sense to add

**01:03:41** other features to the writing computer. It's just for writing. Well, no, the unnamed feature right

**01:03:47** now, I desperately do want on the writing computer, but we'll get to that later. But I held back for

**01:03:52** you. And also with the certain knowledge that all of my streaming software would totally break on

**01:03:57** the developer beta. Like it barely works on the regular release. Like there's zero chance any of

**01:04:02** that's got to work on it. Literally can't, but I was trying to remember, I think

**01:04:10** this is maybe one of the only, maybe the second time ever I've installed the developer beta and

**01:04:16** not waited for the public beta. And it was mainly for that other feature, but I did also want to see

**01:04:20** the focus mode stuff because I mean, people send me messages and they're like, Apple's made a thing

**01:04:26** totally for you. And it's almost like, yes, yes. But the devil is in the details. I will say that

**01:04:32** I am cautiously optimistic about the focus modes. There's some parts of it that I feel like I'm

**01:04:38** still trying to figure out how they work. And there's some things where I can't quite tell if

**01:04:45** it's just a glitch in the beta or if this is the way something is supposed to work. But I'm

**01:04:50** honestly surprised that Apple would make a system like this. Like I think it's much more complicated

**01:04:57** than I ever would have expected Apple to do. It feels very unappily, like don't get me wrong,

**01:05:04** very appreciative. But when you annoyingly told me about this rumor months ago, just to annoy me,

**01:05:12** I was the feeling like Apple's never going to do this. Like this is just totally on Apple style,

**01:05:18** but they did. And I was totally shocked to see that they have these like three or four default

**01:05:24** settings that they want to try to set you up with. It's like work and personal and a couple others,

**01:05:28** but that you can also add whatever other ones that you want. Just completely arbitrary. Yeah,

**01:05:34** completely arbitrary number of these things that they're also integrated into shortcuts so that

**01:05:40** you can turn them on and off with automation. Yeah. Yeah. I say I'm cautiously optimistic about

**01:05:47** these features. Honestly, one of the things that surprises me the most is immediately it's on every

**01:05:52** device. And this was actually a really interesting thing about WBC this year is how many features

**01:05:57** the Mac got as well as iOS. Yes. Yes. I was very happy to see that this year. It felt like

**01:06:05** slow unification would be the two ways. And I mean slow in the best of all possible ways.

**01:06:12** Yeah. There weren't a bunch of radical changes in one place that didn't work other places. It's like

**01:06:17** everything got better together. I think that this is the benefit of underlying technology changes.

**01:06:22** So yeah, one having their own chips because there are some features in macOS Monterey that are only

**01:06:28** available for M1 Macs. And then the other thing is tools like SwiftUI, which are cross-platform

**01:06:36** development languages and stuff like that and Swift and SwiftUI. So like for example,

**01:06:41** shortcuts, which is coming to the Mac that was built in SwiftUI and AppKit. So they could also

**01:06:48** build the new version for iPadOS and iOS and SwiftUI and UIKit. So that's how a lot of this stuff is

**01:06:54** able to work. So I think what we are seeing is again, it's not that they unify in the operating

**01:07:01** systems, but they are unifying some of the things they need to advance the operating systems,

**01:07:06** which allows them to bring features everywhere at once, which I think is fantastic.

**01:07:11** No, I completely agree. One of the, you know, there's always stuff that you find when you

**01:07:15** install the beta that they don't mention in WWDC. And the tiniest example of this,

**01:07:21** which made me super happy was low power mode on the iPad. It's like, oh my God,

**01:07:27** they finally brought low power mode to the iPad.

**01:07:29** It's on the Mac too.

**01:07:31** Is it? Oh, wow. I didn't even realize that.

**01:07:34** Probably one of the reasons it was on both of them is they wanted to add it to one of them.

**01:07:38** Honestly, I expect it was probably for the Mac. They were adding it for the Macs and then they

**01:07:42** just did it to the iPad too.

**01:07:44** I just say like the iPad is a device where I'm often wanting low power mode. I've always found

**01:07:49** it frustrating that it's not on there. And I was like, oh my God, this is fantastic. Like,

**01:07:53** great, please bring these features everywhere. And I didn't realize it was for the Mac as well.

**01:07:57** That like, that's doubly great. And reemphasizes this concept of, oh, unification across the

**01:08:02** platforms. So cool. But yeah, just to completely talk about the focus mode stuff.

**01:08:07** The one thing I'm not sure about, which I think is mostly a bug, but the experience that I've had is

**01:08:14** it doesn't seem consistent to me about say you have a focus mode on and someone sends you a

**01:08:21** notification. Sometimes that notification appears on the lock screen when you just open the phone

**01:08:30** and sometimes it doesn't. I think that's a bug, but I'm not 100% sure. And that's the one part that

**01:08:39** I feel very like concerned about which way does this behavior go.

**01:08:47** I would recommend maybe keeping an eye on what apps are doing that. One of the things that has

**01:08:52** changed, I believe with these versions of iOS and iPadOS is notifications can now be

**01:09:00** set a priority ranking. I think there's four rankings.

**01:09:03** Yes. Yes.

**01:09:05** And they show up in different ways. So if it's third party apps, they just,

**01:09:08** they haven't been able to do any of this stuff.

**01:09:11** Yeah. So like, it's, it's, iMessage is the one that is always my main concern. Like,

**01:09:16** oh, this has always been my like, iMessage, you know, sometimes I just don't want you in the

**01:09:22** mornings. And like, even today it was interesting. Like we were, we were messaging a little bit,

**01:09:27** getting ready for the show and I had on my most restricted focus mode and sometimes your messages

**01:09:34** were showing up on the lock screen and sometimes they were not. And so that just felt like a bug.

**01:09:39** That feels like a bug then. That's a bug then. Because if you have it set that way and sometimes

**01:09:44** it works, like that, that feels like that's the intended thing. And then when it jumps through,

**01:09:48** it's the way it's not supposed to work. That's what I would assume.

**01:09:51** So you think the default behavior is that it shouldn't show up on the lock screen. That's

**01:09:55** what you think should be the default behavior. I mean, if you've said that you don't want to hear

**01:10:00** from me. Well, okay. So let me, let me pull up the actual, there's, there's an option in here,

**01:10:04** which I find so strangely worded. So if you, if you go into your focus modes and then you go into

**01:10:08** the extra options, dim lock screen. No, it's not the dim lock screen. It's the delayed delivery one.

**01:10:13** I feel like as my brain not working, but I have such a hard time understanding this sentence.

**01:10:18** Notifications you receive that are not in your allowed list will be delivered directly to

**01:10:24** notification center until the focus is turned off.

**01:10:28** So when you go to notification center, there are now, so I'm in do not disturb right now.

**01:10:34** And I have two things. One is upcoming and one is notification center. And the upcoming

**01:10:43** is a like collection of things where I just see that there are apps and it's effectively

**01:10:48** storing these notifications until later on. And it's called while in, do not disturb. Right.

**01:10:53** And so what that's meant to do, and I think it might not be doing it completely consistently

**01:10:58** right now, that delayed delivery is collecting up all of your notifications and keeping them

**01:11:03** in that little area. And then when you're done, it just goes like there and you get them all.

**01:11:08** Right. But so in notification center, you can see that you have upcoming notifications. Yes.

**01:11:14** The only thing that didn't feel very cortexly to me was every time on stage, I think it was,

**01:11:18** Craig was doing the presentation where he was talking about the way notifications are going

**01:11:23** to be collected into summaries. He said like three times, don't worry, not people. And I was

**01:11:27** like, no, no, I want the people like people notifications or app notifications. It's all

**01:11:32** the same to me. Like it's like, I do want to collect people notifications into whatever

**01:11:37** these systems are. And I just, I thought it was funny that several times he like wanted to,

**01:11:42** I don't know, kind of like allay people's concerns of don't worry, your friends will

**01:11:46** always be able to contact you. And I'm sitting there like, no, no, I don't want my friends to

**01:11:50** always be able to contact me. They're the worst part. So that's partly why when I was watching it,

**01:11:55** I was like, Oh no, this is going to be another one of these things that everybody thinks is

**01:11:59** custom built for me and actually just completely ignores the one problem that I actually have.

**01:12:04** Yeah. So I find that things slightly strangely worded and this is also the

**01:12:08** like Apple's language for what is where can be a little bit confusing. So

**01:12:12** like the lock screen is not the notification center, but if I, if I'm in a focus mode and

**01:12:17** I swipe down, that brings up notification center. And then what do I see there at different times?

**01:12:24** Like, I dunno, I'll just have to see, you know, a couple of betas in, but what I'm hoping is

**01:12:29** that the expected behavior with flipping the right switches is that if someone messages me

**01:12:38** that doesn't show up on the lock screen. You know, my thought here is to clarify,

**01:12:45** it's like, it's not so much notifications that are really the thing that I'm concerned about.

**01:12:51** It's like distraction is the thing. And even if I don't see what a notification is from someone

**01:13:00** unintentionally running into like, Oh, overnight you got five messages from people. That's a

**01:13:05** distraction to the sort of flow in the morning. So that's all I'm hoping is like, there's a way to

**01:13:10** hide that without having to use the God awful downtime system, which I've turned off to try to

**01:13:16** figure out how to make the focus modes work. I feel pretty confident that this system can do

**01:13:21** that, but it might just be a little too early in the cycle for it to be working reliably.

**01:13:26** The one thing in this little presentation in the focus mode section, they said about how this system

**01:13:31** ties into the custom home screens and your ability to select which pages show up.

**01:13:38** That's amazing.

**01:13:40** I had my mind blown by that part of it. And it's also one of those little moments where,

**01:13:47** you know, sometimes with Apple, it can be very frustrating. It feels like things move very slowly.

**01:13:51** They add features so slowly, but the real power they have is integrating and connecting all of

**01:13:59** their little features together. And this is the one where it's like, Oh my God, that multiple home

**01:14:04** screen thing suddenly makes a hundred times more sense. Like why did they add that feature? It's to

**01:14:11** connect it to this. Especially the fact that you can turn them on and off.

**01:14:15** Yes. So it was like, okay, great. Like I was thinking about how I've had, you know, different

**01:14:20** iPads and it's like, Oh, this is the research iPad and this is the couch iPad. It's like, man,

**01:14:25** with this focus mode stuff, if I can turn on and off the different ways that the home screen looks,

**01:14:31** that goes a long way to not needing to mess with multiple devices and just being able to

**01:14:35** have one device. So whoever, whoever had that big brain moment at Apple of connecting up those

**01:14:41** features, chef's kiss, like what a perfect thing. And one of the weird things, which is like, again,

**01:14:48** like I love when they make the weird decision is you can have multiple instances of the same app

**01:14:56** on home screens. Yes. I was very glad to see that was one of the things I wanted to play with right

**01:15:01** away. It's like, okay, but I can, I have multiple things. It's like, Oh, fantastic.

**01:15:04** If you wanted to have like, I don't know the notes app on your work, home screen,

**01:15:10** your research, home screen, your personal, you can be on all of them. And then there has been

**01:15:15** funny things where people put like the Twitter app as every icon on their home screen. There's

**01:15:19** been like a little thing going around a little bit last couple of days. I haven't seen that,

**01:15:22** but that's fantastic. I mean, it might be a bug right now that you can put the same app on

**01:15:27** multiple times on the same home screen. Like that, that feels redundant.

**01:15:30** Yeah, but that's also hilarious. Please leave that in.

**01:15:32** It's very funny.

**01:15:34** I think this is super cool. Like I'm really into this feature. Like I've only just started tinkering

**01:15:42** with it. Like I haven't truly set one up the way that I would want to, especially because I actually

**01:15:48** think for me, this system will be best on my Mac than on my iOS devices because I would want to

**01:15:56** set up a, I am recording focus. Right. Because that's when for me, I want the most restriction

**01:16:03** because I have my Mac on do not disturb all the time, but there are instances where I would like

**01:16:09** some notifications, but if I turn them all on for messages, I'm going to get every iMessage and I

**01:16:14** don't want that, you know? So I like the fact even that I can have people as well as applications. And

**01:16:22** I do believe it will be possible for developers of third party messaging apps to integrate with this.

**01:16:28** So for example, if you had me turned on and I messaged you in Slack, it would still alert you.

**01:16:34** Oh, that's really interesting. You've got to call that focus mode live all caps. Like that's got to

**01:16:40** be the name of your, I'm recording now. I mean, I was just going to call it recording, but clearly

**01:16:45** I'm not inventive enough. No, live, right? Just like the old timey, big, big red sign outside the

**01:16:51** door. Like Mike's live now. That's what that focus mode is for sure. And it probably could tie into

**01:16:56** home kit and turn on a red light. Yes. Yeah. That's great. Genuinely probably could do that. I'm going

**01:17:00** to look into it because this is like super interesting that you can automate them. Like

**01:17:05** focus modes have an automation, like do not disturb it. So you can set up to the opportunity

**01:17:09** these times, but you can also automate it with a shortcut. So you can add it to a shortcut. So like

**01:17:15** for me, I have a shortcut that I use currently when I record, which sets a timer and puts my device on

**01:17:21** do not disturb, but now it will set a timer and timer and then put all of my devices at once in

**01:17:27** the, I am recording thing. So yeah, super cool. The, the, the across all devices thing is, is

**01:17:33** just fantastic. That's, that's partly what makes it a, just a completely killer feature. And

**01:17:38** yeah, that automation with the home screen stuff, again, like I just haven't had enough time to

**01:17:43** truly play around with it since putting on the developer beta, because I gave myself a day where

**01:17:48** it was like, no, it's so stupid to put on the developer beta. And then I eventually cracked

**01:17:52** and was like, no, but I need to, I have to play around. But I just love the idea of just all of

**01:17:57** the connections that can happen now. Like if I'm on my iPad setting a timer, that's like, oh, the

**01:18:02** writing timer starts now and it puts it in the focus mode, but it also changes what's on the

**01:18:08** home screen so that the various apps that I need when I'm writing are more accessible right there

**01:18:13** on the home screen. And I don't need to try to design a doc that works under all circumstances.

**01:18:19** Like I just, I think it's so well done. I'm really happy with all of that. Also just a little feature

**01:18:24** that I was very glad to see there and grateful to whatever engineer put it in is just the option to

**01:18:29** hide the badge notifications as well. So it's like that again is where my concern is it's not just

**01:18:36** notifications, it's distractions. And it's like, okay, great. I was very relieved to see the option

**01:18:42** to say, I don't want to see badge numbers is there as well. I was like, oh, thank God. I'm so happy

**01:18:47** that's there and is a sign of like, this is thinking about it in the way that I'm hoping that

**01:18:53** they're thinking about it. I'm surprised of how fiddly it is. It's a pretty fiddly UI, right? Like

**01:18:58** you go in and you set a bunch of check boxes. And that's, it's not typically the kind of stuff

**01:19:03** that we see from Apple. Like they want to do it for you, right? Yeah. But I like everything's off

**01:19:09** when you try and set up a new focus mode and you have to turn stuff on manually. I'm like, yes,

**01:19:13** this is what I wanted. There is a, there is a little checkbox of like, would you like us to

**01:19:18** change these? Like a smart detection? No, don't want that. I'll tell you when to do it. Don't you

**01:19:25** try and do it for me. Right? That's how bad stuff happens. When I quite enjoyed happening a few

**01:19:30** times and I was never in a good spot to turn it off was in the old system, do not disturb,

**01:19:35** had an automatic option for turn on, do not disturb while driving. Yeah. And I discovered that

**01:19:42** riding my bike is apparently enough to make that think that I'm driving a car. And so like,

**01:19:48** I'd be on my bike and someone would send me a message and be like, I'm driving now. I'd be like,

**01:19:52** what? How are you doing that? You don't have a license in London. You can't be driving now.

**01:19:58** It's like, Apple, you must know I have running on my watch, like currently cycling outdoors. How

**01:20:04** on earth do you think that I'm driving a car right now? So I saw that too. And it made me laugh. I was

**01:20:09** like, you're not going to predict when I want to do serious work. I'll tell you what I'm doing.

**01:20:13** Serious work. This episode is brought to you by LinkedIn jobs. Today, many small business owners

**01:21:58** upended everything there. This is not complete rethink that people were hoping for or thinking

**01:22:03** there's no windows. There's no external monitor support. To me, this feels like a better foundation

**01:22:11** to work from going forward. I think this is the best implementation of this system, which is now

**01:22:17** six years old. Right. And that's brutal. Now this system of side by side app and a

**01:22:25** slide of app, you know, that's the way it's been for this amount of time. And in that whole time,

**01:22:29** the way that you've been done it is a various modes of dragging things around with your fingers.

**01:22:33** Right. And with the iPadOS 15 multitasking, they've added two things, which I think are fantastic.

**01:22:40** One is this little pill that sits at the top of every open application, which you can tap.

**01:22:45** And it will allow you to either set that app as a full screen, set it as a split screen, or put it

**01:22:50** in slide over. Fantastic. Super easy. The big thing is they have added keyboard shortcuts

**01:22:56** for everything. So this is my favorite part. Here's my question about keyboard shortcuts,

**01:23:02** because you say for everything, but I'm having a hard time with some of the keyboard shortcuts.

**01:23:07** And this is some of this is 100% developer issues because I get hilarious crashes sometimes. And

**01:23:12** then the language of my keyboard changes, which I find interesting. Here is the use case that I

**01:23:20** don't think they have a keyboard shortcut for, but I hope I'm just misunderstanding. So

**01:23:26** let's say I'm on my iPad. I have two apps side by side. I've got Obsidian and I've got Ulysses open

**01:23:32** and I'm working away. And then I go, Hey, you know what? I want to put on some of my writing music

**01:23:37** to listen to on repeat a thousand times like a crazy person. Is there a way to open up music

**01:23:45** on that screen, either in one of the two side by sideways or in a slide over without lifting my

**01:23:53** fingers off the keyboard? Because I don't think there is. There is. Okay. How? All right. So one

**01:23:58** of the things that's important to note is that there is now a new modifier key, which is the

**01:24:02** globe key. I did love that. Like when I saw the globe key being used as the shortcuts key, I

**01:24:07** thought, Oh, that's quite clever. And I also thought, countdown to how long will it be until

**01:24:13** the globe key appears on the next Mac book. I wouldn't be the least bit surprised if it does

**01:24:18** eventually show up on the regular keyboard. No, it is on there now. Is it really? Yeah. Like,

**01:24:22** I believe so. The globe keys on the magic keyboard. Oh, is it on the actual laptop itself though?

**01:24:27** Yes. Okay. Well, there we go. Prediction instantly reached retroactively. I didn't

**01:24:33** even realize it was there. Yes. The bottom left key. Oh, okay. It was just, it's totally erased

**01:24:36** from my brain because I'm always on these mechanical keyboards and I just forgot about

**01:24:39** it and assumed it wasn't there. But, and something that I like. So obviously mechanical keyboards,

**01:24:44** external keyboards don't have that key, but you can remap it. So on my, yes, I've remapped the

**01:24:49** caps lock key to be the globe key. Oh, that's, that's an interesting choice. Yeah. I've always

**01:24:52** done caps locks as control. Who needs caps lock? No one needs caps lock except for very angry people

**01:24:58** on the internet. So this is a thing where, so what we're talking about here, you want to put it either

**01:25:04** on the left or right hand side of the split, right? Right. Okay. Now, if you do it the way you would

**01:25:10** think you would do it, it doesn't work. Right. So this is the way I've been trying to do it is I

**01:25:15** think, okay, I've got my two windows open and I want to swap one of them for something else. Yep.

**01:25:21** And so the way I try, I've tried to do it is I pull up a spotlight search. I search for music

**01:25:27** and then I use the keyboard shortcut to try to put it left or right. And my, that doesn't work.

**01:25:31** My iPad crashes and literally will switch to Chinese sometimes. And it's like, whoa.

**01:25:36** You can do this, but you've got to do it the other way around. Okay. What does that mean? So you start

**01:25:42** by globe control left or right. Say you want to put something on the left or right hand side,

**01:25:46** then do the spotlight search, huh? And then whichever app you choose will take the other side.

**01:25:52** Oh, okay. Interesting. I'm very glad to hear that. This was the first thing that I tried

**01:25:57** because this is what we have been asking for forever. Yeah. That you can start a search and

**01:26:02** then you can just open the app on the left or right hand side. So you can do it. You just have

**01:26:07** to start with, I want to change the split screen, then do your search and it will replace it.

**01:26:12** Interesting. That is so incredibly backwards from the way that I would think about it,

**01:26:15** but whatever. I'm very glad that's there. I've gotten used to it very quickly. I've

**01:26:19** been doing this over the last few days. Something else, which is also kind of cool.

**01:26:23** You can use the keyboard now to select an app from the home screen.

**01:26:28** Oh, can you? I didn't, I didn't realize that. So when you're on the home screen, you just press tab

**01:26:32** and then you can go left up, down and right. And it highlights each application. You can just

**01:26:36** launch the memory too. Oh, that's very, that's really nice. Yeah. I'm super glad to hear that

**01:26:41** about the keyboard shortcuts though, because that has, you know, like I've mentioned research pad as

**01:26:47** like the iPad that I use for research and I have always loved it, but I've almost always described

**01:26:53** it in the context of using it primarily for reading and internet research because the,

**01:27:02** it's always just been too much of a hassle to switch back and forth between writing and reading

**01:27:08** and doing all of the other stuff. And I think if I can use the keyboard to quickly switch between

**01:27:14** Ulysses for writing, Obsidian for notes and Safari for finding stuff or Kindle for the book that I'm

**01:27:21** going through, like being able to switch rapidly between those three or four without having to take

**01:27:27** my hands off the keyboard. I think that does have the potential to really change the amount

**01:27:33** that I use the iPad. And I'm like, I'm just very, very happy to hear that fast switching is possible.

**01:27:40** Now, like I really think that that could be a real game changer for how I use the iPad again.

**01:27:46** They have done a very good job of making the system that they truly seem to believe in

**01:27:52** make more sense for power users, in my opinion. And they've added stuff in like there's this kind

**01:27:58** of weird double menu bar now. You mean the thing on the bottom that has like the different tabs?

**01:28:03** Is that the one that you mean? Yeah, there's two. So in an application, you can hold down the command

**01:28:08** key and see what options are available for you with keyboard shortcuts, but there are also actions

**01:28:13** you can perform. And this is where if an application is a catalyst app, they've added all of the Mac

**01:28:18** specific menu bar items. And so now the iPad applications benefit from those. But also there's

**01:28:25** also one if you hold down the globe key, which tells you all of the things that are system related

**01:28:31** that you can do. Yeah, like you can bring up control center and notification center now keyboard

**01:28:36** shortcuts. Now that you can basically operate the entire system now with the keyboard, which is a

**01:28:41** thing that you could not do before. Yeah. And that is because they've added this new weird key. It's

**01:28:46** the globe key. Using that globe key is just fantastic for this too. And it's just an accident

**01:28:51** because it was originally only used for the like emoji and language switching, right? Like it

**01:28:55** basically wasn't used for hardly anything. It's actual, I believe it's original purpose was purely

**01:28:59** language switching. Then they put emoji behind it. But it just works out that that globe idea to

**01:29:06** represent the languages is also perfect for these are the global commands for the system that are

**01:29:12** not tied to any particular app. So it's like, Oh, what a happy coincidence. And yeah, it's,

**01:29:16** it's very interesting that that's where they put all the commands. Two thumbs up to that.

**01:29:20** The one little suggestion that I might have for the team is, and again, maybe I'm just missing an

**01:29:25** obvious thing about this, but I like that you can now like move the windows around, but there seems

**01:29:32** to be confusion about which window is in focus. So, so even like when you're pulling up the keyboard

**01:29:40** shortcuts, it's not always obvious which app in a split screen situation is the app that is

**01:29:48** currently focused on. So they have actually added an affordance for this now. Okay. What have,

**01:29:53** what have they added? So at the top of each application, you have those three dots, right?

**01:29:57** And those three dots are where you can tap that and get it to do the multitasking things. The

**01:30:02** active application is now, there is now a highlight around those dots. Oh my, oh my God. That was

**01:30:07** literally going to be my suggestion. Do they just add this in? Is this like developer beta two?

**01:30:12** No, I haven't seen that yet. It's in beta one. I think you got to kind of know what you're looking

**01:30:15** for to see it because it's subtle, but it's there, you know, so if whichever application

**01:30:21** has the little highlight around the dots is the active application. Oh, I'm very glad to know

**01:30:25** that that's there then. Cause yeah, that was the only other thing I was thinking is like,

**01:30:29** which app why, Oh, these are the keyboard shortcuts for the wrong one, or I moved the

**01:30:32** different one onto the other side, but that is, that is, that is great. Oh man, you've,

**01:30:37** you've made me a lot happier about the keyboard shortcut stuff. Cause I just was worried about,

**01:30:42** no, the one thing I really want to do with these shortcuts, I can't figure out how to do it,

**01:30:46** but I'm, I'm very glad that it's there. One of the other things I've always wanted from

**01:30:50** iPad multitasking is a way to control it with shortcuts that now exists. So this is actually

**01:30:57** because of the fact that they have added shortcuts to the Mac. So Mac OS Monterey

**01:31:03** is bringing shortcuts and it's starting a multiple year transition to becoming the automation system

**01:31:09** on the Mac. So it's going to replace automator to do that. They had to add in a bunch of things

**01:31:15** that automator can do. Most of these are Mac related, but some of them they've created iPad

**01:31:21** counterparts. So a lot of files related actions now exist on the iPad that didn't before like

**01:31:27** getting the contents of a folder, saving to a specific folder in the files app,

**01:31:31** grabbing files from the files. That was the things that shortcuts couldn't do before.

**01:31:35** But one of the things that it has gained is the ability to set applications in split view and

**01:31:41** slide over. So there's a couple of things that you can do. One for me, I love it. Like I've had,

**01:31:46** I have this show prep shortcut that I've had for years, which will open a Google doc and set a timer,

**01:31:53** but now it can open a Google doc. It can set Safari on the right hand side and then open notes

**01:32:01** in a slide of a view as well. Absolutely perfect for me. But then also the thing that we've asked

**01:32:06** for years for, which is the ability to create app pairs, you can now do that with shortcuts and put

**01:32:12** an icon on your home screen if you are in choosing, and it can just be two applications that they will

**01:32:17** just open and be next to each other. I know that this feature is there because when I couldn't

**01:32:21** figure out how to make an app, an arbitrary app just go to the left or the right, I'd started

**01:32:26** building some shortcuts that were, what are all the combinations of things that I could possibly

**01:32:30** want? Right. So, so I made a shortcut that was U O and that would open up Ulysses on the left and

**01:32:38** Obsidian on the right. And then it was like K U Kindle on the left, Obsidian on the right.

**01:32:44** I mean, you still might want that, right? Cause that's, that's going to be the fastest way to get

**01:32:48** to specific apps that you want. Did you know by the way, as well in the multitasking switcher

**01:32:53** where you see all of the applications, you can now create and break multitasking in that view.

**01:32:58** Yeah. I think, I think that's, that's like a fun demo. I'm not sure I'm going to use that very much,

**01:33:03** but that is cool to see. It's one of those things that I wanted it every now and then and was really

**01:33:07** annoyed that it didn't work. Right. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm just happy. Like, so I can go in

**01:33:12** there now and be like, Oh, that's the app I was looking for. I don't need it in a split view and

**01:33:16** I just drag it out. I think also one of the little features that I wouldn't have thought to ask for,

**01:33:22** but I'm very glad is there is in that multitasking view. You can now see what is living in slide over.

**01:33:30** Yes. Right. Whereas I always kind of felt like slide over was this really random look. Like I

**01:33:36** never knew what I was going to get in slide over. It seemed like apps sometimes fell out of there

**01:33:41** or went into there for reasons that I just couldn't quite figure out. And it's like, Oh,

**01:33:45** now being able to just visually see, you know, you have P Calc and the notes app in slide over as

**01:33:51** like, great. Okay. I can just see that they're there and what order they're in. I really, really

**01:33:56** like that as an addition, even though I like, I would never have thought to request it. So it's,

**01:34:00** it's nice to be able to see that. And also from that window, be able to boot stuff out like, Oh,

**01:34:05** I don't really need music and slide over anymore and just get rid of it. I feel like I haven't done

**01:34:09** a good enough job of just underscoring the fact of how incredibly excited I am that shortcuts is

**01:34:14** coming to the Mac. Like this was very tippy top of my feature request list for the year.

**01:34:20** Oh, really interesting. Because over this last year, I have moved most of my work back to the

**01:34:25** Mac again, right? I've been talking about it on the show before and shortcuts was the main thing

**01:34:30** that I was missing because there were things that I've been so used to doing on my iPad and my iPhone

**01:34:36** that I can't do on my Mac, or I have a little problem that I want to fix. And my brain kind

**01:34:40** of knows how to use shortcuts, but I couldn't do it on my Mac. So I'm super excited about this.

**01:34:45** I actually think there are a bunch of things that I can do with the power of the Mac that will be

**01:34:49** fantastic for me, like file management and stuff like that, like super excited. And I mean,

**01:34:53** and if you are like a old school diehard automation expert, you can run scripts and

**01:34:59** so shortcuts, you can use Apple script, shell scripts, all that kind of stuff. It will work,

**01:35:04** which is, I mean, frankly, astounding, honestly, that they've built that functionality in. I think

**01:35:10** Apple surprised me a lot this year, honestly, like they've added a lot of features that I want.

**01:35:16** And then they've also implemented them in ways that I would want, but wouldn't have expected

**01:35:20** them to do. Yeah, I haven't had a chance to play around with shortcuts on the Mac. I think that was

**01:35:24** less high on my list because I'm one of those people who was using keyboard maestro and automator

**01:35:30** to do a bunch of the things that I wanted. So it wasn't as high on my list, but I am very glad to

**01:35:36** have a unified system and to say, okay, now it's just going to work the same way. And I don't,

**01:35:42** I don't have to open up these automator actions that I've been carrying around for years and

**01:35:46** years to do some of the stuff on the Mac that I want to do. That is very nice. And I'll be curious

**01:35:50** to test the import of like, Hey, can you just suck in all my old automator stuff? So I don't have to

**01:35:56** think about it. I'll be curious to see how that goes, but it will be really nice to have shortcuts

**01:36:00** on the Mac. And from what I remember it looked like in the demo, you can do the same thing,

**01:36:05** like on iOS, where you can create pseudo app icons, where you can click them and like run

**01:36:10** the shortcut that way. So they're everywhere, man. You can run them from app icons. They could be in

**01:36:14** the dock, the menu bar and in finder. Yeah. Like great. Perfect. That's exactly what I would want.

**01:36:19** I think I saw someone say in the relay FM disco, which I really liked, like you could create a

**01:36:25** folder in the dock, you know, like you can do like those little stacks and just put a bunch of

**01:36:29** shortcuts in there. A bunch of shortcuts in it. So cool. I thought that was a really clever idea,

**01:36:33** but then frigging widgets, which suck on the Mac. And I can't believe they have not like,

**01:36:38** I want widgets on the Mac home screen as well. Why not? Like, why like the notification center

**01:36:43** area of the Mac is, is pretty bad at the moment. And it's not getting fixed, which is whatever,

**01:36:50** whatever. Like that one got left behind this year, but I never use it anyway.

**01:36:54** Yeah. I'll just say like, we've said it before and I will say it again. The acquisition of

**01:37:00** shortcuts by Apple is maybe the best acquisition that the company has ever made. And years later

**01:37:08** after that acquisition, like I'm very happy to see that unlike some other times when companies

**01:37:15** get acquired, like it didn't just disappear into the behemoth of the company. Like shortcuts really

**01:37:22** has become this totally core part of now all of the operating systems. And I'm just so happy about

**01:37:30** that. And what I like too is the people that I knew that worked on workflow are still there.

**01:37:37** And like, I see them in the videos, you know, like in the session videos. And that also just makes me

**01:37:43** feel good about what they're doing with it. Like that the people that made this app and cared about

**01:37:47** it and thought it had something and wanted to keep like wanted to make it, they want to continue

**01:37:52** working on it and keeping it going at Apple. Yeah, it's fantastic. One of the engineers was

**01:37:57** saying that like, it was interesting for them because they had to become Mac developers this

**01:38:02** year. Right. Of course, none of them have made a Mac app before. Right. They knew iOS apps. That's

**01:38:09** what they knew how to make. They had to learn to become Mac developers. But isn't that what

**01:38:13** catalyst does? You don't have to learn how to be a Mac developer. You can just. It's not catalyst.

**01:38:17** Oh, it's not. Okay. It's Swift UI and app kit. Okay. Now the version on iOS is Swift UI and UI kit.

**01:38:25** Oh, I guess that explains some of the visual redesigns as well. That's why it looks different.

**01:38:28** Which is, I was, I was also really glad for the collapsible hierarchy stuff. I was like,

**01:38:33** Oh, thank God. You know, when you have a bunch of nested statements, it's like now I can just

**01:38:37** collapse all of that away and make it a hundred times easier to scroll through. Because there's

**01:38:41** so much that has gone on in shortcuts this year. And in a way that I think we weren't expecting so

**01:38:45** much. It's been kind of missed that the app has been completely redesigned. Right. Which in other

**01:38:51** years would have been the story, but the, it looks different. The organization is different. And then

**01:38:56** they've added in some features to make things a bit more neater, which I mean, it kind of has

**01:39:00** resulted in the iPad version is pretty buggy right now, but that's what you would expect if an app

**01:39:05** was completely rebuilt. It's also easy to forget because they've done so much with it.

**01:41:12** of this show and all of Relay FM. Let me now tell you about the other universal feature that

**01:41:21** no joke, even though people will be like, oh, focus modes, 100%. That's what Grey wanted to talk

**01:41:26** about maps. Obviously he's super excited about all the new maps features. It looks like a video

**01:41:31** game, right? Oh my God. The new maps night mode is gorgeous. It looks like it's very interesting. It

**01:41:36** looks, it looks like a video game. I'm intrigued. This isn't the feature. I mean, I might give

**01:41:41** Apple maps a go again because I want to see about their transit stuff. I think you totally should.

**01:41:46** Like I will just say here quite legitimately, Apple maps has been the butt of jokes for years.

**01:41:53** And I think partly because of that people have not properly perceived how improved Apple maps

**01:42:00** has become. Like I think people are just really blind to their slow, but very good

**01:42:08** incrementing of features. I think part of the reason though is because you don't need to care

**01:42:13** because Google maps is also brilliant. Yeah. I'm not like, I'm not saying that Google maps isn't

**01:42:17** good. It's just like, I just think people underrate how good Apple maps currently is.

**01:42:23** And they're thinking about that time they gave it a try three years ago. And one of the things

**01:42:29** that I've noticed is that Apple maps has started doing some of the, um, I don't know, no, quite

**01:42:34** what to call it, but like the Google AI stuff where they mark off districts for you that aren't

**01:42:40** official places. But like, if you go scroll around London, the Apple maps will mark off like,

**01:42:47** what are the commercial districts in these various areas? Like where is the actual high

**01:42:52** street of this town? And that's outlined in orange as like, boy, is that stuff incredibly

**01:42:57** useful when you're visiting some place that you're not familiar with to know, Oh, all of this area

**01:43:03** is residential area. And then this area is the commercial area where shops and things are like,

**01:43:10** what a pain in the ass it must be to build that kind of feature in, but it's so useful.

**01:43:15** And it's also so subtle that you might not even really think about it that like the app is kind

**01:43:20** of directing you to, if you're in the city, these are the places that you probably want to go. You

**01:43:26** probably don't want to just wander around randomly in a residential area that has nothing commercial

**01:43:31** for you. Lots of little things in apps. I really love that their defaults 3d satellite imagery is

**01:43:38** back. Like whenever you switch into satellite mode, used to then have to manually turn on the 3d

**01:43:43** thing. And I always found it super annoying because the 3d view is super helpful, but like,

**01:43:46** it's, it's there. Apple maps also added in a feature, which is the, I want to know when I need

**01:43:53** to leave to reach a particular area by a certain time, which they just hadn't had for quite a while.

**01:43:59** So it's like, great. That's added in of like, I need to be at the airport by 8am on Wednesday.

**01:44:04** Like when do I need to leave by? So I would totally recommend giving it a little try. And

**01:44:10** I mean, all of these things are personal, but one area where I think Apple maps really does do a

**01:44:17** good job as I've, I've just found that they're always better at the audio cues for when you're

**01:44:24** driving. They're just better about telling you like, when do you need to turn? Telling you

**01:44:32** at the moment that you actually want to know. Whereas I found all of the other systems that I use,

**01:44:38** they tell you like, Oh, turn left ahead, but not as reliably at like the moment when I actually

**01:44:44** want to know, Oh, was it this left turn or is it the next left turn or this other stuff? So I would

**01:44:49** totally recommend giving it a try if you happen in a while. Plus it just looks beautiful. I'm

**01:44:53** poking around it now. And so good. It really is very well designed in a way that I think I haven't

**01:44:59** given it credit for. It's gorgeous. I think the colors that they choose are, are really beautiful.

**01:45:06** It's a great looking map, especially if you're in like the new map area, like they've, like,

**01:45:11** I know this is almost like a joke on the show now, but I really do think that the map stuff is

**01:45:16** super interesting. I want to hear more from Meg Frost. Like tell me more about these maps and

**01:45:22** they're super cool features. And I do think that the map system is the key to their augmented

**01:45:29** reality future. Like they even again showed just a, just a quick little demo of like, Oh, by the way,

**01:45:35** in maps, now we can pinpoint your exact location by looking at the streets around you.

**01:45:39** And we can draw an arrow on the street of which way you need to go. It's like,

**01:45:45** gee, Apple maps. What might that be used for? I can't understand. Yeah. It's like, you know,

**01:45:51** you want to see Apple's AR future, like look at maps and it's gorgeous. But anyway, that was not

**01:45:57** what I wanted to talk about specifically, but like, I just love the maps update and I think it's really

**01:46:01** good. And I use the Apple maps app a lot. I want to get you a t-shirt that just says maps.

**01:46:10** I would totally wear that shirt. 100%. But okay. So here's the secret feature I was saving to the

**01:46:18** end. The thing that I was legit the most excited about the thing that when I heard it, I was like,

**01:46:25** I'm going to install this developer beta on every one of my machines, except for the writing

**01:46:29** machines. And it is synchronized tab groups in Safari. Okay. Great. I'm pleased we've got you.

**01:46:38** I cannot tell you how excited I am about this. All right. This is even more than the focus modes.

**01:46:47** This is like the best feature for me this year in the operating system. This is interesting. Focus

**01:46:53** modes, people who've listened to the show, you know how like years of frustration and like all

**01:46:58** of my anger around that very high, but like synced tab groups beats it out and it makes like such a

**01:47:07** tangible difference to the way that I work. I can barely express it to you. And it's like,

**01:47:13** though, when I got that developer beta on, you know, I've got three different machines is like

**01:47:17** thing number one I was doing is like making the tab groups for different projects and synchronizing

**01:47:22** them together and trying to pull out all of the random tabs I have on different machines.

**01:47:27** And I was like, what bliss, what bliss to finally have Safari work the way that I think

**01:47:34** it should work with these tab groups. So I'm thrilled. I love it. Interesting. All right.

**01:47:39** Super high level tab groups allows you to now collect up a selection of tabs and you put them

**01:47:44** into what is effectively a group of folder and they live in the sidebar. So you can have multiple

**01:47:50** groups of tabs. They live in the sidebar or in a menu on the iPhone. And these tab groups,

**01:47:55** when you add or remove them, they are synced across all of your devices. This is a really

**01:47:59** cool feature. I think of Safari. What is interesting is the new design for Safari.

**01:48:04** Very controversial so far. Yeah. I mean, I think it's fine. Like I think it makes more sense on the

**01:48:09** phone. The address bar on the bottom of the phone I think is an improvement, even though it's weird.

**01:48:13** Like it's it takes a little bit of getting used to it there on the I mean, I haven't used the phone,

**01:48:17** but I've seen screenshots and stuff. I am just so thankful they've gotten rid of that stupid

**01:48:22** carousel thing. They're like the card catalog style, like the way that you would go through tabs

**01:48:27** on the iPhone. Oh, yeah. It's now a grid again, which is how it should have always been.

**01:48:32** Yeah, yeah, it's much better as a grid. The Safari redesign, I think I'm mostly fine with it. I think

**01:48:39** the one thing that's weird is if you have a bunch of tabs open, the how to put that to put this like

**01:48:48** previously on Safari, you have the thing that is like this is the URL bar. Here is the URL that

**01:48:54** you are currently located at. And in the current version, that changes depending on which tab you

**01:49:02** have open. Where is that on the screen? So I find that a little bit disorienting. It's like, oh,

**01:49:08** sometimes the URL that I'm looking at is all the way on the right. If I'm looking at the right

**01:49:13** most tab, and if I'm looking at the left most tab, it's all the way on the left. Like I don't

**01:49:20** love that, but overall the redesign, I would give it a thumbs up. I think it's fine. I wasn't begging

**01:49:28** for a redesign, but I don't hate it. I'm trying to get used to the new tab view where the tab is

**01:49:34** also the address bar. I'm still getting used to it. I'm kind of bummed that pin tabs don't seem

**01:49:39** to be a thing anymore. I like that. However, I think tab groups will actually give me better

**01:49:44** organization that way. I think I could get used to it. I would say that in the broader Apple

**01:49:51** community is this is not loved this design to put it mildly, but I would say for me, I'm mostly fine

**01:50:02** with it because I really like the tab group feature. I think it's really cool and it actually

**01:50:07** helps me with organization. I don't need to have 50 tabs open if I can collect them up into little

**01:50:12** groups instead. Yeah. The only feature I would request, which doesn't seem to exist, is I would

**01:50:19** love to have an ability to say open all new URLs in a specific tab group. The fact that there is

**01:50:27** like a local unsynced set of web pages, I find a little strange and I wonder if that's going to

**01:50:35** cause user confusion with people when it's like, wait, oh, I didn't know that because I only have

**01:50:40** it on one device right now. I thought that everything would be synced, but it's not.

**01:50:45** So it doesn't sync everything. And I suspect like the one thing I worry about is if the tab

**01:50:52** groups feature is received as unpopular because there is an inconsistent behavior that people

**01:50:58** don't understand. And like it's always seemed weird to me that Safari doesn't sync anyway.

**01:51:04** It'd be a bit like if your notes app doesn't sync and people are like, no, no, that's the way I want

**01:51:09** notes apps to work is that it's not supposed to sync. I only have this notes on this computer.

**01:51:13** And it's like, no, no, that's just the way you've used computers for 10 years. It's like, that's

**01:51:18** not actually a better way to do it. It always seemed to me like Safari state should universally

**01:51:24** sync just like your notes app state universally syncs, just like your photos universally sync.

**01:51:31** And I think people who argue for non-universality sync in web browsers are just arguing out of the

**01:51:39** way they have used something in the past. But I suspect that that contingent is quite strong

**01:51:45** and vocal. And it's why Safari's default behavior is this split way where when you click a URL and

**01:51:54** it opens a new page, it opens that page in what is now effectively. This is your local copy of

**01:52:02** Safari on this machine. And these tabs do not sync. Only the tabs that you put in tab groups

**01:52:11** sync. And I just wish there was a way to tell the system either like, hey, this idea of local web

**01:52:17** pages is stupid and dumb and just synchronize everything. Or what I tried to do was I just

**01:52:23** created a tab group called tabs. And I tried to find a way to tell the system like, open all new

**01:52:29** URLs in this tab group. Yeah. So that it's just synced across machines. But as far as I could tell,

**01:52:34** there's no way to do that. Yeah, doesn't look like it. But even currently the way that it works,

**01:52:40** it's fine because if I am in a tab group, all new tabs and new URLs open within that group. And

**01:52:47** it's like, it makes such an incredible difference about just keeping track of what was I looking at

**01:52:54** for various research projects. It's like, I do not have the words to express how huge of a deal it is

**01:53:01** to not lose track of interesting web pages that I had open somewhere or what would happen more

**01:53:09** often is like recreating on each machine the same sort of groups of similar pages on a topic. And

**01:53:18** like it was just incredibly frustrating. And it's, it's why I talked on several shows ago about

**01:53:24** trying to figure out some way with shortcuts or system automation to like force this behavior by

**01:53:30** automatically bookmarking and opening tabs. And it was just like, it wasn't possible. So

**01:53:34** synced tab groups was my hallelujah moment in the keynote. And I was so pumped. And even on

**01:53:41** developer beta one, it's like works great. I'm so happy about it. There is one thing I don't like

**01:53:48** about Safari, which is like how basically every action is hid behind that three dot button.

**01:53:53** Yeah, yeah, I don't know what they're trying to do there. That's very odd to me, including the

**01:53:58** share button. So like it's so many taps now to share something that that that's like a,

**01:54:04** an odd choice. The design brief there feels a little bit like someone thinks Safari is much

**01:54:12** more space constrained than it really is. That's a little bit what this design feels like. I think

**01:54:18** especially that it's this way on the Mac too, I think is the most egregious part. Yeah. Yeah.

**01:54:24** You know, we're good, you know, we're about 20, 30 inch monitors. Like it's fine. Yeah. I can have

**01:54:31** one extra button there, but I agree with you. That is weird. And I've found myself being like,

**01:54:37** I want to send this webpage to a shortcut. Where the hell is, oh, okay. It's under here. And then

**01:54:42** it's like, it's fine. I can, I can live with, I mean, I can live with almost anything in exchange

**01:54:47** for tab group. So there are many betas, you know, where things change design wise. And actually

**01:54:53** Safari has a history of radical changes and then some of it is walked back by the time the

**01:54:58** release is out. I actually think Safari is probably where we'll see the most design iteration

**01:55:03** throughout the beta process. Yeah. I wouldn't be surprised. I mean, if I had to pick one thing,

**01:55:08** I would probably say, can I just get the tabs separate from the current URL? Like that's the

**01:55:15** thing that I like the least, but I also think I'll get used to it over time. It's just weird

**01:55:20** right now. And I don't like the inconsistency. This is so new and it's so different. Yeah.

**01:55:25** One last thing I wanted to ask what your thought was, or if you tried it yet is universal control.

**01:55:30** No, no. Um, I haven't tried universal control. I laughed out loud at, uh, Craig's totally

**01:55:37** ridiculous, but also completely metal demo of I'm going to drag this file from my iPad

**01:55:45** into final cuts on the Mac. I was like, Oh my God. My favorite part of that is he just

**01:55:51** unnecessarily dragged it over another computer. So it went from an iPad to a MacBook, to an iMac,

**01:55:57** and the MacBook did nothing in the process, except be there. Yeah. Especially for me,

**01:56:03** the fact that he dropped it into final cut of all things is like, Oh my God. I think that's an

**01:56:08** amazing demo. I have a hard time imagining I would ever actually use it because I really love

**01:56:14** putting my iPad into sidecar mode with the laptop as a second monitor. Like I use that all the time.

**01:56:22** That's one of my favorite new, uh, features from last year or the year before. I can't remember,

**01:56:27** but I use that constantly as a quick and easy way to get a two screens on a laptop. But to me,

**01:56:32** the big benefit of that is this is now all the same machine and I can use it in the same way.

**01:56:38** Like I just, I have a hard time imagining a situation where I specifically want to use an

**01:56:43** iPad in that way with the Mac. I can imagine it. Yeah. Maybe I'm wrong, but I just, I have a hard

**01:56:50** time imagining any way that would be better than just sidecar-ing the iPad into a second monitor,

**01:56:58** unless there's some app on the iPad that only runs on the iPad. But yeah, I don't know. Do you

**01:57:02** imagine a use for it? I could times. Like there are some app experiences that I prefer on the iPad,

**01:57:08** but I could also imagine just, I have this screen here and like, I want to have a full screen

**01:57:12** fantastical window. I'll just pop over and open it rather than do the whole sidecar thing or

**01:57:17** whatever. You know, I could think as these devices can continue to get closer and closer to each

**01:57:22** other, it's almost like having a second screen rather than even needing to do a sidecar. There

**01:57:27** was just one little implementation detail that I just think is super clever. Your devices don't

**01:57:32** know where they are related to each other, right? Right. They have no idea, right? You put your

**01:57:37** iPad to the left hand side of your iMac. Your iMac doesn't notice an iPad next to it. The way

**01:57:42** it works is you have to kind of take your cursor and you push it all the way to the edge of the

**01:57:47** screen and you keep pushing. And then you see this kind of cursor trying to break through to the iPad.

**01:57:54** I did really like that animation. Like when they showed that animation on the demo, I was like,

**01:57:57** oh, that's a cool way to put it. Like you're trying to break through this membrane separating

**01:58:02** the two devices. So when you do that, you have proven where these devices are in relation to

**01:58:09** each other. And that's how it knows. Right. But I haven't, since I haven't tested it, you must have

**01:58:15** to invoke some command on the Mac to say I want to push the cursor through, right? Like it doesn't

**01:58:22** just work if the iPad is just open next to the Mac, right? Like you must have to say what, no,

**01:58:27** what you're doing is you're just like, you push it off the screen and then you keep going. Right. I

**01:58:31** guess what I'm asking is that behavior is just default always that if I have an iPad open,

**01:58:39** or another Mac and I have a Mac open, if I ever move the cursor to the edge of the screen,

**01:58:45** if I keep pushing, it will push through to the other device. Like that's just the constant

**01:58:50** default behavior. I believe so. Yes. That is very clever. Then I guess it also like the devices know

**01:58:56** there's other devices in the proximity that are open. Right. So like it's got to know there's a

**01:59:02** device first and that's using continuity. Right. Like it's not going to give you that option if

**01:59:08** the iPad is locked or the screen of the laptop is closed. But I just think it's such a clever way

**01:59:15** of dealing with it that it's like if you had your iPad like on the below your monitor and you push

**01:59:21** on the left-hand side, it's going to come in from the right-hand side. Right. Right. It's just

**01:59:26** assuming that people wouldn't do that. Right. Yeah. What would you some kind of monster who wants to

**01:59:31** have the cursor go off in the wrong direction to get to the other screen? So it's just like one of

**01:59:36** those things like I just love the UI design of that. It's just using kind of behavioral

**01:59:42** psychology really like it's just the way people do things. That's how we're going to make it work

**01:59:46** because once you've done that first part, you can then move freely between them. You're just

**01:59:51** establishing where it is in the first instance. You don't have to keep doing that pushing thing.

**01:59:56** Right. Right. That is very clever. I didn't really think about it. Very good. WWDC overall.

**02:00:02** Lots of stuff. I think that Ridiculous demo is maybe one of my favorite tech demos I've ever

**02:00:08** seen Apple do. Like I think there was just a lot of showmanship in that feature. It was really,

**02:00:16** really well done demo and made me smile and was ridiculous, but also impactful at the same time.

**02:00:24** I was like, that was great. There's an Apple at its best presentation style of like, look at the

**02:00:30** way all of our things are integrated together and this silly, but also useful and funly designed

**02:00:38** feature that we've created. Like that was a A plus demo for sure. We're going to round out the show

**02:00:45** with an Ask Cortex question. Of course. Hashtag Ask Cortex. We do them every time now. You can

**02:00:50** always send them in if you want to of a tweet. Hashtag Ask Cortex, or you can use question mark

**02:00:55** Ask Cortex in the relay for members discord. Haley asked, have either of you considered

**02:01:00** working a four day work week? I'd be curious to know what your thoughts are on it. I mean,

**02:01:05** I'm guessing with the number of shows that you record that you couldn't really do a four day.

**02:01:11** I could. Could you squeeze all of your shows into four? Yeah, I could. I mean,

**02:01:15** it's rare that I record five days. Okay. Like I usually kind of depending on the week, I might

**02:01:22** record a show on three days or on four days, but I might be on some days doubling up, but I

**02:01:27** typically don't record every day. I wouldn't want to though. Like I sat and thought about this for

**02:01:32** a bit. So the idea of a four day work week, I guess is in essence taking a five day week and

**02:01:38** turning it into four. Right. I know that sounds maybe a bit stupid, the way that I put it,

**02:01:43** but it's the idea of like, of most people who have a Monday to Friday, typically nine to five job.

**02:01:50** What do you think about either dropping a day or dropping a day and adding more days onto the other

**02:01:56** four? I expected the two ways you would do it, but I don't work Monday to Friday, nine to five.

**02:02:04** Like if I did a four day work week, I've lost three days. Right. Because I,

**02:02:12** I work a bit every day by and large, and that's just how I am. It's what I like to do. And

**02:02:19** sometimes it can just be simple stuff. Like I'm not sitting down and editing a podcast seven days

**02:02:23** a week. Right. But I think my ideal for this will be more in the spirit of it rather than the

**02:02:30** actuality of it. So working a little bit less than I do now, but still every day, rather than

**02:02:36** restricting it to just certain days. Like who wouldn't want to work less? Yeah. I mean, I think

**02:02:42** it's part of the usual way that I always hear the four day work week pitched is that the second

**02:02:48** option that you said where it's like, okay, instead of five days a week at eight hours a day,

**02:02:52** it's four days a week at 10 hours a day. That's the usual version that I hear pitched of the four

**02:02:56** day work week. I think that can make sense in a lot of circumstances, but it sounds like it

**02:03:00** doesn't necessarily make sense in your circumstance at all. Because I feel like I kind of maybe already

**02:03:05** have my own version of this, which is work less five days, but work every day. Right. Right. Yeah.

**02:03:15** As you were talking, I was just trying to think, I'm fairly sure I did do a four day work week,

**02:03:22** technically at one of the schools that I worked at, but that's, it's not quite the same because

**02:03:26** I was a part time teacher there, but I was like going in four days a week instead of going in five

**02:03:31** days a week. And I do think for schools, if I was a full time teacher, I would totally push for

**02:03:39** schools doing four days of 10 hours a day rather than five days of eight hours a day. Like I would

**02:03:45** 100% push for that kind of change. I think there's a lot of jobs where there would really be a huge

**02:03:51** benefit for people moving to a four day work week, you know, not least getting rid of the sort of

**02:03:57** fixed costs of going into work of like your commute time and getting ready for the daytime

**02:04:04** and lunch expenses and whatever. So I would say as a general statement for most jobs in the economy,

**02:04:12** I would think they could probably almost all benefit from a four day work week, but there's a,

**02:04:19** just like you, there's totally a difference when I think about myself and it's part of the reason

**02:04:26** when I made that weekend Wednesday video, like what I found working worked for myself is over

**02:04:33** the years I realized like I just don't, when I'm in a working groove, I don't really need a two day

**02:04:40** weekend. Like the two day weekend is sort of wasted on me. And that's why my current working schedule

**02:04:46** is to do two days on and a day off and then three days on and then one day off and then repeat. And

**02:04:54** that works super well for me. Like my God, has that been a fantastic pandemic schedule. But the flip

**02:05:00** side of that is even though I don't have regular weekends of series of two days off, what I do,

**02:05:07** like after sharks, sometimes after big projects, I just take a bunch of time off. And I think

**02:05:14** there's a way in which that kind of balances out with the weekends of, yes, I'm working more

**02:05:21** consistently over the course of the year, but I also don't do that indefinitely. And there are

**02:05:27** times when I'll just take a bigger, longer break after the completion of a project. So that's the

**02:05:33** way I feel like that's the groove that I've worked into over these years of I like the more consistent

**02:05:39** work. I feel like for me, one day off every couple of days is a much better working schedule.

**02:05:46** And I think in my current situation, a four day work week would just be worse if I was trying to

**02:05:53** do all of the work in four days and take three days off. Like, I just think that would be a

**02:05:58** terrible schedule for me in my current situation. Even though I think that is by default probably

**02:06:05** the best answer for most jobs in most of the economy for everyone else. That shocks video that

**02:06:11** that did see you've mentioned it a few times that really does seem like it took it out of you.

**02:06:15** Look, Mike, this is this. That was a long, brutal project. This has also been a very long

**02:06:24** WWDC episode. So very long. So I think it's time for some more texts. So like we always say,

**02:06:35** two times as pattern. All of this and more texts at get more text.com.
