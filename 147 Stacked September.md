# Cortex - 147: Stacked September
**00:00:00** What color is it? I like to do a lot of sort of neon 80s kind of magenta and cyan kind of colors

**00:00:06** Is that just for podcasting? It's in the hue app. There's like a theme that's called Soho

**00:00:10** I use that a lot when I'm doing work. So I'm doing writing stuff

**00:00:13** I also put on the Soho colors which matches my obsidian theme which is neon 80s. So it's a

**00:00:20** Very consistent lighting look I'm gonna take a look at the hue app. Do you have the hue app for your office?

**00:00:24** Do you have you like stuff? I have a couple of lamps of hue bulbs in them

**00:00:27** However, for some reason that I can't fully understand and it's happening again

**00:00:31** The hue app doesn't really work for the studio, but I have the lamps running

**00:00:35** I think the problem with these lighting setups is there's a s curve

**00:00:39** You need some number of light bulbs to make it look good, right?

**00:00:43** So it's like yeah having four light bulbs is eight times better than having two light bulbs

**00:00:47** You need a bunch but then it tails off very fast like now there's too many

**00:00:50** So if you just have a couple I don't think you get the real effect of these themes

**00:00:55** I discovered the delights of LED strips as part of redoing this office that I was like, ah, right

**00:01:02** Yeah, we have one of those couples at home actually I used to have one on my old desk in mega office

**00:01:08** Oh, yeah, and we got one for Adina because she really liked it too

**00:01:11** But I don't have any of that kind of stuff in the studio. I mean

**00:01:15** it's still a thought of mine to

**00:01:19** actually take advantage of

**00:01:21** Floor lighting in the studio to not have these big overhead lights that I have

**00:01:27** Yeah, and Hugh now do make more bright bulbs

**00:01:31** Hmm, like that's the thing that they do that

**00:01:33** They didn't do when I first started buying these they actually just have like much brighter bulbs

**00:01:38** Which I think I would need and would take advantage of getting a few lamps

**00:01:41** But this is now gonna be a project which goes along with the home because we like floor lighting at home to Robin and overhead

**00:01:47** And so I think once we try and work out how the lamp situation for home

**00:01:53** It might give me some ideas for the studio too

**00:01:55** But I mean kind of a phase right now where I want to read do some stuff in the studio

**00:02:00** But I just haven't really got the capacity for it right now

**00:02:04** But I think it might be something that take a look at towards the end of the year start next year

**00:02:08** I can't remember where I first came across it

**00:02:10** But I like whatever I discovered the existence of LED strips. I was like, oh, that's intriguing

**00:02:14** I was watching some tutorial where someone was putting them together and they just they made the off-handed comment about how all

**00:02:20** Lighting is so much better if you're never looking directly at the source of the lighting

**00:02:24** Yeah, and I was like, ah, right

**00:02:26** So like I've tried to do that with all of the lights in my office is like none of them am I ever looking

**00:02:32** Directly at they should all be bouncing off of something or like you use the LEDs to hide them under the desk

**00:02:37** You should never look at the LED strip. You should just look at it bouncing off of other stuff

**00:02:42** I've looked directly into the LED strip and never looked directly to the LED strip

**00:02:46** Also, I think it's funny that you were saying that you want brighter bulbs because I want nothing more than dimmer bulbs

**00:02:51** Like they're 1% is not dim enough for me. I'm like, I need this bulb dimmer

**00:02:56** I agree with you in some circumstances right that like I do want dim

**00:03:00** But I just mean the amount of light that would be dim in the studio to light the studio is a lot of light needed

**00:03:07** You know, hmm something I did get with you recently

**00:03:10** In the bedroom they have Edison style bulbs now, which I really liked. What does that mean?

**00:03:16** I don't know what that means

**00:03:17** So like if you look at the bulb if you just google Edison bulb

**00:03:21** It's like a bulb star where you would see the filament in like a coil. Oh, I think of these as hipster light bulbs

**00:03:27** Yeah, okay. Yes. They hips the light bulbs

**00:03:29** Yeah

**00:03:29** And so Hugh made a range of hips the light bulbs and of course we got them for the bedroom and they are just inherently

**00:03:36** Less bright, huh? So they're really good for the bedroom

**00:03:39** Like we have a lamp on each side of our bed and like they like shine down towards us

**00:03:45** But you can put it really low. It's it feels to me lower than any other hubob that i've used

**00:03:50** Did you colors or is it just white? It's just warmth

**00:03:54** I think no say I like I want all my neon lighting but I want it at like

**00:03:59** 0.25 brightness. That's that's how I work

**00:04:03** I've got 20 light bulbs, but I all want them at like tiny amounts of light

**00:04:08** makes sense

**00:04:10** So how's september going mike, you know, I had this thought because I wanted to like touch base of you about this anyway today

**00:04:17** Because it's hilarious to me that it was two episodes ago

**00:04:20** Two episodes ago where I was talking about how busy I was where like i've gotten to the point in my life

**00:04:26** I think where the word september has a different

**00:04:32** Meaning

**00:04:35** Uh-huh, it has a different emotional valence perhaps yeah, I think that's what's going on

**00:04:40** I don't really feel this way about other months maybe december, right because december's christmas, you know

**00:04:45** So it's like oh, it's a good nice family time or whatever

**00:04:48** But I feel like the word september has like a really different meaning to me now

**00:04:54** And I think it's you know

**00:04:55** I say it a lot during the month more than I would a regular month, right like september is childhood cancer awareness

**00:05:00** Like it becomes part of like a thing that I say

**00:05:03** But then, you know, it's just coupled in the iphone event and travel and like yeah this one

**00:05:09** It's been really tough and it continues to be very busy

**00:05:12** But I found some moments this month where it's been rewarding feeling you like once we actually start getting into the fundraising stuff

**00:05:20** It's

**00:05:21** It gets a different feel and as we're recording this i'm a couple of days away from traveling to memphis and that also really changes

**00:05:28** The feel of the month for me

**00:05:31** But it is also what makes the rest of it so complicated because I am also going to be away for like a third of the month

**00:05:37** So like, you know that adds in

**00:05:39** Complication to the rest of it. So it's been pretty busy and I don't think anything could highlight the busyness of the month

**00:05:47** Then the fact that I got invited to the iphone event and I said no. Yeah, that's an indicator of

**00:05:54** How busy your calendar is?

**00:05:56** Why did you say no to going to the iphone event mic?

**00:05:59** It was just too complicated and I've got too much stuff on this month and I I could not see a way to make it work

**00:06:07** That wouldn't cause some kind of problem that I wouldn't have otherwise had

**00:06:13** So like for a selection of reasons which are complicated. I cannot change my travel from london to memphis

**00:06:21** And so it was always going to have to be

**00:06:24** I would need to be back here to leave again. That's crazy. No, it felt like way too much

**00:06:30** And so I said no, but like the thing about it. That's just so interesting to me is it's like

**00:06:36** Well, that's like the hot ticket, right?

**00:06:38** I just listened to a podcast where someone described the iphone event as like the super bowl of technology

**00:06:44** It's like yep, that's pretty fair. Yeah, everyone's paying attention whether you usually care or not

**00:06:49** Like i'm listening to like podcasts this week that aren't tech podcasts and they're referencing the fact that there's a new iphone

**00:06:54** You know, it's just like it permeates popular culture. Yeah, I have a friend who calls it apple christmas

**00:07:00** See for me actually, I would say it's wddc

**00:07:02** But that's because I mean it more right for me like finding the software is the most exciting but I can understand how

**00:07:08** People would assume that this is it because it's when the toys are announced, right?

**00:07:12** So you got invited to the north pole and you're like, I can't make it. I was like no santa

**00:07:17** I cannot come this year. So it was just such a strange

**00:07:21** thing to do right for me if like

**00:07:24** Here's a thing that you

**00:07:26** Had always like oh imagine they're like maybe not even thought like because it's such a hot

**00:07:31** Ticket even more so than wddc, right?

**00:07:34** Because it's like in the steedroofs theater which puts a hard cap on how many people they can invite

**00:07:39** Right wddc do it outside so they can just keep increasing the number if they want to just add more rows of chairs

**00:07:45** Is a very different thing. However many humans you can fit in that enormous circle is the limit

**00:07:51** Exactly so they can just keep increasing it and I feel like the 2021

**00:07:57** Or 2022 sorry, I should say 2022 wddc the first one where they had people come to the campus

**00:08:02** It did feel like that like it just kept getting bigger and bigger more and more people were getting invited

**00:08:07** Like from developers and media and stuff like as it was as the month was going on

**00:08:12** This one's like there's a hard cap on it and I was super

**00:08:16** Happy and honored to receive the invite immediately, right? Like as soon as it came out it landed in my inbox

**00:08:22** and

**00:08:23** I sat on it for a couple of days and I thought about it and I had a bunch of conversations with people in my life

**00:08:29** I looked at it. I looked at it from a bunch of different angles and just ultimately

**00:08:34** realized that

**00:08:36** I'm going to do a bad job of something

**00:08:40** That is important

**00:08:42** If I go to this including

**00:08:44** I may have done a bad job with my iphone episodes, right? Like the episodes of upgrade and connected

**00:08:51** And this show that were scheduled to be done this week

**00:08:55** With the travel and how condensed it was going to be and probably how

**00:09:00** Wired in a bad way. I was going to be it would have made everything worse and it would have made st

**00:09:05** Worse it would have made family stuff worse

**00:09:08** Like everything would have been brought down by in this one instance

**00:09:12** Different years might be different. We might plan for it differently next time

**00:09:14** All right

**00:09:15** Like if we think this might happen again

**00:09:17** But I don't know. I just felt like it was a thing to mark to have gotten it

**00:09:21** And also a thing to mark in my personal growth that I could turn it down and feel

**00:09:27** Confident and content with that decision. It is strange to say

**00:09:32** I think you did make the right decision

**00:09:34** Like you said it's amazing to be invited like that's great

**00:09:37** but it

**00:09:38** It is surreal to be at a position like that to try to think through like is this a thing that I can add?

**00:09:45** right because

**00:09:47** Again, like you said you don't plan your september's around the idea that you're going to get an invitation to something like that

**00:09:53** Just never happened before. Yeah, exactly. So I was like, oh

**00:09:56** It's like we were saying that, you know those two episodes ago how

**00:10:00** For your career september has become this really big month

**00:10:05** That started with the iphone and then these other events like saint jude like other things that you're doing like it's all sort of

**00:10:13** Taken over the month of september as like these are the big projects now and I think

**00:10:19** This year has now really solidified that with this event of like oh

**00:10:24** The thing that started all of this I cannot actually make time to go for because of my prior commitments. Yeah, it's a real

**00:10:32** Interesting career moment. Yep. I can only imagine

**00:10:36** Like how do you think you would explain that to?

**00:10:39** Younger mike, I don't think I can

**00:10:42** No, I thought about this

**00:10:44** Like I was talking with another friend of mine who was in a very similar situation and also couldn't make it

**00:10:50** And I said to him like could you even imagine us from three years ago?

**00:10:57** You know you think about like when you say younger like 20 year old me. Yeah, like two or three years ago

**00:11:03** Saying like oh you'll get an invite to the iphone event

**00:11:06** But you decide not to go because you have different priorities that time. It's like

**00:11:11** It's a wild thing to imagine in my

**00:11:14** line of work

**00:11:16** I don't think I could explain it to myself of like oh you'll have different priorities of like but there is no other priority

**00:11:24** It's the iphone

**00:11:26** You know, yeah, I like that you already shortened this timeline to three years ago you because yes

**00:11:30** I was imagining like young mike, right?

**00:11:33** Let's say 10 plus years ago would explain to him the situation

**00:11:36** Would you like no three years ago mike would have a very hard time with understanding the situation?

**00:11:41** We don't even need to go back that far. Yeah, it's just a strange thing to have done

**00:11:45** I really like

**00:11:47** Took a moment when I was when I like you click it and you rsvp know

**00:11:52** Click submit like I took like one of those mental image kind of things

**00:11:57** I like remember this feeling because it's so weird to do

**00:12:02** and look and it all of this was helped by the fact that my wwdc experience was an actual like

**00:12:10** May as well have been a dream

**00:12:13** Just how perfect it was

**00:12:15** like

**00:12:16** going to the event and being with my friends and

**00:12:20** Then getting to try the vision pro

**00:12:23** It was unbeatable like and I knew that as well which really helped like it was like this event

**00:12:28** Was not going to grant me like i'm not going to get like

**00:12:33** Special access or something like because this doesn't happen

**00:12:36** Right as we were talking about on the episode the vision pro episode

**00:12:40** This kind of idea has maybe happened like three or four times in modern apple history

**00:12:45** Yeah, yeah of people being able to use a device like we've seen a significant time before it comes out

**00:12:51** And so it's just never a thing that I even would have imagined for myself to be able to have done

**00:12:56** And so now I feel like I kind of had the perfect experience

**00:13:00** So this coming along three months later

**00:13:03** It didn't sting so much that I couldn't make it because I already had something this year

**00:13:08** Which is just like far away and exceeded my expectations

**00:13:12** That I didn't need to prove something to the younger version of me

**00:13:18** By doing this. Yeah, I think there's always this danger in

**00:13:22** Obligations to your former self, but this is a slightly different version, right? Which is

**00:13:27** It's easy to end up still like carrying the goals of a younger self

**00:13:32** Even when that's like it doesn't really make sense

**00:13:36** I think it's mentally useful a lot of times and i've discussed this on like previous theme episodes, right?

**00:13:41** As you sort of like imagine if you're in this situation today like clean slate without all of the history that got you here

**00:13:48** What kind of decisions would you make? I often find that as like a like a clarifying way to try and

**00:13:55** rethink the past goals of your younger self and

**00:14:00** I think it's just very common that

**00:14:03** In people's careers when they're pursuing a goal, especially if it's a goal

**00:14:08** Over a long period of time both like your career and the world around you

**00:14:14** change in ways that

**00:14:16** Can make that goal like not as sensible or not as important as it previously was but it's really easy to not notice that in the moment

**00:14:25** To be like aha, like this is the thing that i've been chasing for a long time. It's like

**00:14:30** Right, but it was like a different you who started this like and does this make sense right now and and it doesn't always and like

**00:14:38** Yeah, I think that's really difficult to do for everyone. Like I know I sometimes catch myself doing that sort of thing. It's very easy to just

**00:14:45** unintentionally

**00:14:47** Carry forward past versions of yourself that aren't actually relevant to your current goals and current decisions

**00:14:53** I hope I can do it one day like I would like to sit in that theater. It would be a cool thing to achieve

**00:14:59** Yeah, and it would it's still a bucket list item to tick off and I hope that one year

**00:15:04** Everything lines up and i'm able to time it out differently like for example

**00:15:09** If the iphone event was next week, it would have been doable i'd be in america already

**00:15:13** Right. And so like a lot of the complication I think we could have worked around differently

**00:15:19** But it just couldn't work out this time. I hope I get to do it

**00:15:23** but I feel really

**00:15:25** pleased with

**00:15:26** myself that i'm in a position where

**00:15:29** I was able to do it and I was able to get through it all

**00:15:32** With like minimal jealousy of my friends who were there

**00:15:36** Like because that was the thing I was worried about like, oh am I going to be super jealous and like I wasn't

**00:15:42** I was just happy for people that were there

**00:15:44** I kind of wished I was with them because I wanted to see them

**00:15:47** But I didn't regret it. Basically, there was no regret. All my friends are at the prom, but i'm not at the prom, right?

**00:15:53** Yeah, like that's that's not how you want to be feeling on the day and there was no regret

**00:15:56** Well, i'm very happy for you, but yeah, it could not have fit into what i'm going to dub stacked september

**00:16:04** All the things that mike has to do

**00:16:07** This is absolutely terrible of me to say but

**00:16:11** As the person who has a lot to do but not remotely as much as you this morning

**00:16:16** I had one of those mornings where I woke up and i'm kind of like

**00:16:19** Right. You have that like tension of like oh god, right?

**00:16:23** Immediately you wake up with like the list of things that you have to do and it was like it was a five in the morning

**00:16:28** Right, and i'm like, oh god, right i've got all these things. It's like wait wait, just like

**00:16:32** Think about mike. Remember what mike has to do. It's like, oh, okay

**00:16:39** You can still be busy and feel busy like just because i'm busy doesn't mean

**00:16:44** I mean like if it helps you not feel bad, right, but like that's awesome. It's an exercise in comparison

**00:16:50** Yeah, but I wouldn't set it as like I shouldn't feel this way because oh, I don't mean it that way at all

**00:16:56** No, no, like yeah, just to be very clear. I think that's a really dumb mental framing that lots of people do

**00:17:01** Yeah is the like oh someone has it worse than me. So I shouldn't feel bad

**00:17:07** I think that's just really dumb. I mean it much more in the way of

**00:17:11** It's like we got that great ask cortex question a while ago about like doing each other's jobs, right?

**00:17:16** Just any time I think about trying to do your job. It's so horrifying to me, right?

**00:17:21** It's more like that. You want my job in like april if you want it like that's like a good time

**00:17:26** Is that the chill mike time it feels like it. I don't have any bad feelings about the word april

**00:17:32** So right it's probably pretty good. Just a negative valence for a snack september stack september

**00:17:39** Oh, hi mike, what are you doing here? You're in my ad i'm here

**00:17:43** Because the subtlety is back

**00:17:46** Stack september is also subtle september. Oh, I love it

**00:17:51** Fantastic

**00:17:53** The only problem is it's running until october, but don't even think about that. It starts in september

**00:17:57** Yeah, it starts in september. They will still be on sale at october

**00:18:00** But you know you want to get them in stack september

**00:18:02** Maybe that's the thing about stack september actually lasts for six weeks. That's what makes it so stacked

**00:18:07** It just doesn't end back for a limited time only cortex brand

**00:18:12** Dotcom you will find all five colors of our teas and sweaters navy black gray red and green

**00:18:19** But this year we're adding a whole new product the subtle hoodie a lightweight hoodie in the same colors and material

**00:18:27** As the subtle sweater. I'm very excited about this

**00:18:31** I've had a model of this for a couple of weeks and i've been wearing it and I love it

**00:18:35** So we have had our original hoodie for years

**00:18:38** It's but it's a very thick hoodie and I like in the kind of spring and autumn time to have like a thin hoodie

**00:18:45** We're in the studio

**00:18:46** Maybe i'm going down to the shops or something and not have to you know have a coat

**00:18:50** It's like a nice layering item

**00:18:52** And so we've been able to bring the subtle embroidery to a nice lightweight hoodie this year

**00:18:57** So cortex brand.com is where you go find them. We have them in all the colors something

**00:19:02** I'm actually pretty pleased about this year. We have more color consistency than we've ever had before

**00:19:08** between the items

**00:19:09** So we made some tweaks to some of the colors one of them is a new blue. We have new blue

**00:19:14** In the sweater and the hoodie and they are much closer than they've ever been before the sweater as well in general

**00:19:21** I think is a higher quality item. It's softer on the inside than some of the sweaters we've had in the past

**00:19:27** this is all the result of

**00:19:29** Finally being able to make more decisions on stock management. Yeah because of the pandemic

**00:19:36** Yeah, yeah, like there were just things we could not have access to i've been trying to make the subtle hoodie for like two years

**00:19:43** At this point, but we could never

**00:19:46** Get all of the colors that I wanted like even this time

**00:19:49** We had to make some choices and we found the right one and i'm super happy with it

**00:19:53** So it's still not as easy as it could have been but this is the easiest it's ever been so we can finally offer

**00:19:59** This full range in all of the colors with the new edition

**00:20:03** And it's just about what we were able to get access to color wise and I think now the entire product line

**00:20:09** Looks how I want it to and i'm super excited about it

**00:20:12** So as we mentioned, it's a limited time sale it's available for just three weeks

**00:20:15** So you have until october the 10th to get your order in

**00:20:19** So if you're listening to this right now and you're like, oh man, i've wanted to get one of those or that sounds really good

**00:20:24** Let me go check it out

**00:20:26** You have until october the 10th after october the 10th. It's not on sale anymore

**00:20:30** So if you want it you got to go now and get it i'm just gonna say this

**00:20:34** I think I say something like this every year

**00:20:36** This has got to be our most

**00:20:39** I regret I didn't purchased it item because we always get messages after it's done where people are like

**00:20:46** Oh, it's like I wanted to get it's like no no limited time until october 10th

**00:20:50** You want to go you want to get the shirts?

**00:20:53** This is the time of year, right? It starts at stack september if you're hearing this early october

**00:20:59** You better get a move on right before it actually closes, especially our subtleties

**00:21:04** This is basically

**00:21:06** 99% of my wardrobe now are the subtlety

**00:21:09** like one right now

**00:21:12** I

**00:21:13** Love the material. It feels really nice. It's like the perfect weight for an everyday t-shirt little thing

**00:21:21** I love is that there's no tag on the back. It's just like a nice detail to put it on

**00:21:26** I am extremely picky about t-shirts and I always feel like god. It's such a hard time finding one. That's good

**00:21:33** This is the best one like it just is it's why i'm wearing it

**00:21:38** All the time

**00:21:39** So I put in a huge order to make sure that I have enough for the whole year every time because it's like I want all of these

**00:21:47** Here's how much I know that people really like this shirt. So we've done this for a number of years now and

**00:21:54** Digging through the data as the head of logistics. There you go. Basically

**00:22:00** Basically every year we do this sales almost perfectly double for many years in a row now

**00:22:07** And what that says is that the people who bought it last year like all of them buy it again

**00:22:13** When this year comes around and we add some more people

**00:22:17** So I feel like that speaks for itself that people buy these shirts love them and then want more of them

**00:22:23** I just like

**00:22:24** Cannot praise them highly enough. That's why i'm wearing them all the time and it's just worth remembering if you know around here

**00:22:31** Why do we call it the subtlety like where did that come from?

**00:22:34** Like obviously the name was a joke that when it was just a subtlety because it's like subtlety

**00:22:38** But then we added the sweater and the hoodie and then the joke didn't make any sense anymore. I forgot that like it's funny

**00:22:43** It's so long ago. I forgot that's the origin of where it was in my head

**00:22:47** It's just like oh, it's it's the subtle shirt, right the subtlety

**00:22:50** But the reason that this product existed is I was looking for something with our logo

**00:22:57** That I felt like I could wear in any environment

**00:23:01** That like something that didn't feel like a typical merch t-shirt

**00:23:06** And like we have that you can go to our store at any time

**00:23:10** And buy like the big screen printed cortex logo on a t-shirt and I own them and I love that

**00:23:15** But I don't want to wear that all the time and I don't want to wear that in every instance and I feel like I can

**00:23:19** Go and I can have meetings with people. I can go to like smart casual events and I can be wearing the subtlety

**00:23:26** Or I can wear the subtle sweater

**00:23:28** And I fit in and it's comfortable and it just looks like a nice piece of clothing that it is

**00:23:35** But it's more subtle. It's more like

**00:23:37** Understated but you're still able to wear something with a brand that you appreciate which I hope is our one

**00:23:43** So that's why it exists. I'm super happy that we've added the hoodie now

**00:23:47** I will be buying a bunch of the hoodies and a bunch of the sweaters and a bunch of t-shirts like I do

**00:23:52** Every single year like so many cortexes do go to cortex brand

**00:23:57** Com and you can find the subtlety the subtle sweater and the subtle hoodie today, by the way to find the subtle hoodie

**00:24:04** Click on the sweatshirts

**00:24:06** That's where it is in the store or you can just click any of the links in the show notes

**00:24:09** And it'll go directly to the product of your choice cortex brand dot com only until october 10th

**00:24:16** Cannot stress this enough. October 10th is the last day

**00:24:21** Go now cortex brand dot com

**00:24:24** I have a little piece of uh feedback that I just wanted to mention that was sent in by a

**00:24:29** Cortexon that I quite liked and it's this article about

**00:24:34** Douglas adams author of hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy, which I quite enjoyed as a kid

**00:24:40** You know, he wrote like the first book and it was very popular and then like the pressure is really on he's got to work on

**00:24:44** The sequels. How did he work on the sequels?

**00:24:47** Well short answer is he didn't he was having an extremely difficult time working on the sequels and it turns out that he was basically

**00:24:56** forced to do a gray cation his publishers

**00:25:01** rented a big suite in a hotel and locked him in it to finish a book that was way overdue

**00:25:10** I just found this kind of like a little charming article

**00:25:12** But also kind of crushing because it's like clearly he had a bunch of difficulty working on these kinds of projects

**00:25:18** and so much so the detail here that I quite like is

**00:25:22** They did not trust him to just be in the hotel room and actually write so his

**00:25:28** Editor was just sitting on a chair facing away from him to make sure that he was writing

**00:25:35** Oh my god, right this is in the time of typewriters

**00:25:38** And so the article is just describing here how the editor was saying like oh, he you know

**00:25:43** he'd bring like his crossword puzzles and books and like admin work to do or whatever and

**00:25:48** He would just be listening for the sound of typing

**00:25:52** And if he didn't hear typing for a significant amount of time

**00:25:55** He would like turn around and see how douglas adams was doing and apparently douglas adams was just like very sad most of the time

**00:26:03** But this is how they got the book finally finished from him

**00:26:06** Which I just think is like a very funny example of this kind of thing of like

**00:26:12** Put someone in a place where there are just no distractions and only give them one thing to do

**00:26:16** Which is this typewriter because we need to get this book finished, man

**00:26:20** So this is the follow-ups to the hitchhiker's guide?

**00:26:23** Yeah, this one is particularly talking about like so long and thanks for all the fish which I think is the last one in the series

**00:26:29** I'm not 100 sure about that. But what also charmed me about this is

**00:26:34** I'm not going to say who it is, but I have a writer friend who is

**00:26:40** The worst person i've ever met at deadlines. My god if you're saying that I can't

**00:26:47** No, no, no mike, okay

**00:26:50** How dare you listen first of all the thing that's different is I basically don't have deadlines, right?

**00:26:56** Like I set up my whole life so that there aren't really deadlines. So I don't miss deadlines. I just don't have deadlines

**00:27:03** It's a big difference, right? So i've got this friend who does have deadlines, right set by publishers

**00:27:09** Who he has missed consistently for like

**00:27:12** Half a decade off right is like the biggest misses of deadlines of anyone i've ever known

**00:27:18** and

**00:27:19** He has done

**00:27:21** basically the virtual version of this

**00:27:24** So he has an assistant but his assistant isn't physically located where he is

**00:27:29** So he shares his computer screen with his assistant who virtually watches him type

**00:27:36** That's not what I thought you were going to say. I think you said get on a zoom or whatever. That is the nuclear option

**00:27:44** I like the idea that like this assistant could just move the mouse pointer back to the word processor

**00:27:50** Right

**00:27:51** It could start to drift off and then the mouse just like moves back over click

**00:27:56** And the stars blinking at you. Yeah, so his assistant has a dual screen set up specifically for this so that they can have

**00:28:04** His shared screen on one monitor while they're working and it is the exact situation that like douglas adams had 30 years ago

**00:28:12** Like she's waiting to see that the cursor doesn't move that words aren't appearing on the screen for a little while and then is like

**00:28:19** Hey

**00:28:20** What are you doing over there?

**00:28:23** Look, you know you mentioned that you found this sad or whatever and I can imagine a lot of people do

**00:28:27** Feel that way like like I don't think this is sad. This is just these people's processes like

**00:28:33** This is what it takes to do the work. And as long as the work is still good

**00:28:39** And the person wants the work to exist. I don't consider this

**00:28:43** To be a sad thing

**00:28:45** It's just how the work is done

**00:28:48** Yeah, I mean I think douglas adams it quotes him as

**00:28:52** Literally weeping when asked about his deadline. Sorry. I think he was having a much harder time

**00:28:58** Yeah

**00:28:59** He was going through a different set of circumstances there like so my friend is again

**00:29:03** Like he's doing the thing where he's trying to set up a system that gets more work out of him

**00:29:08** This is the thing. I think if you set it up for yourself, that's fine. Yeah, if somebody sets it up for you

**00:29:12** That's not so fine

**00:29:14** It's like a commerce in the middle of it all right like that's not so good

**00:29:18** That's exactly what this is. Like he was forced to do this

**00:29:21** It's like the publishers like we're the people who pay your money

**00:29:25** You need to be in this hotel room at 3 p.m. Tomorrow and we're not leaving until we get a book out of you

**00:29:31** And it's like all right

**00:29:34** If we remove that part of it

**00:29:35** Just like this idea that i'm happy you brought in of like, you know, someone who has a similar situation

**00:29:40** It's like this is just what it takes to get the work done

**00:29:43** And like for a lot of people including me it is deadlines like

**00:29:48** That's what I need

**00:29:51** otherwise

**00:29:52** The work doesn't get done. I drift, you know

**00:29:56** yeah, and i've always said that like I think it's interesting that

**00:30:00** deadlines clearly do work like that for some people that like and if you know that that's the thing and if it feels to me like

**00:30:07** that's true for

**00:30:10** It's got to be like the vast majority of people are like that. I think the majority of people

**00:30:14** I think they exist. I think deadlines exist for a reason like this idea of

**00:30:20** When work needs to be done and how it's done and like I think it's perpetuated an idea and I do believe that it comes from

**00:30:25** the fact that like

**00:30:27** People buy and large meet deadlines and that inherently suggests that it works at least a little bit

**00:30:34** I don't know if it's good or bad for people but is it better or worse than the things not being done?

**00:30:39** like I don't know so anyway, I found it an interesting little article and I like this as

**00:30:44** I think of

**00:30:46** What I do compared to most people as seeming quite extreme and weird

**00:30:50** So I was very happy to read an article about an extremer and weirder situation

**00:30:56** Yeah, at least no one's locking you inside of a hotel room

**00:30:59** Yeah, anyway

**00:31:01** I only do that to myself

**00:31:04** So we made reference to the iphone event that means there must have been an iphone

**00:31:08** Yeah, there was a new iphone event. I hosted you at mega studio

**00:31:12** We had like a fun little evening. It was you me and underscore widget smith. I'll watch the apple event together

**00:31:18** I like that crew good crew definitely more entertaining than just

**00:31:22** Watching it on your own. I really don't like watching these events on my own. Oh, yeah at this point

**00:31:27** I've seen like a lot especially wwdc. I've watched more wwdc's in the company of others

**00:31:32** even in like hotel rooms in san francisco or san jose

**00:31:36** And so like i've gotten that feel for what it's like to watch with people talk to people laugh make jokes

**00:31:42** Like what did he say?

**00:31:43** Oh, you know like that kind of thing that goes on like i much much prefer being able to watch these events

**00:31:50** With people rather than watching them on my own

**00:31:53** I couldn't believe that you wanted to host us because

**00:31:57** That again in stack september was a very busy day for you because we're watching the event

**00:32:03** And then you were recording upgrade in like a couple hours afterwards. Yeah, but

**00:32:08** It's better than just hanging around on my own

**00:32:10** See again

**00:32:11** This is just the difference between us where it's like if I had to record a podcast is like no no social event ahead of this

**00:32:17** No, no, no, like i'll watch that event on my own but like hosting two other people

**00:32:22** That's a whole day in and of itself

**00:32:24** Well, there were some moments after the event before you guys left because we was I had hours to spare still which was good

**00:32:31** Where you were talking and I was just silent for a while because I was like making some notes, but

**00:32:37** I just enjoy watching these events with people because I also like to hear

**00:32:41** different

**00:32:42** Thoughts and feelings before i'm then going to talk about it, you know

**00:32:46** Yeah, and it's also always fun to kind of see what gets the small involuntary reactions out of people

**00:32:53** Like what causes someone to like laugh or go?

**00:32:57** Or whatever like it is interesting to see like where you know, how do other people react a little different moments at the event?

**00:33:03** I was gonna say I think it is fair to say I also much more enjoyed watching this event with other people because it was perhaps

**00:33:12** one of the

**00:33:13** Less exciting apple events that I have ever seen. I don't know if i'd necessarily agree with that like, okay

**00:33:20** This is better than last year

**00:33:22** Like with the iphone at least maybe you're excited by the apple watch ultra because it was new right?

**00:33:27** But like the iphone portion and like just in general if you're

**00:33:31** A pro customer, especially if you're a pro max customer

**00:33:34** This is a more intriguing prospect than last year's phone. I think yeah

**00:33:39** Okay

**00:33:39** So that is the difference because like you're the pro max guy, right?

**00:33:42** Whereas I like I made this decision of i'm just never doing this i've always tempted

**00:33:46** But it's like no no i'm gonna have a policy decision of i'm not buying the big phone

**00:33:51** Because I always regret it. We'll see. I think there's a lot of this going on this time. It's gonna change again

**00:33:56** I agree that you feel this way. No, there's a policy mike, right? We'll see

**00:34:01** Can't change the policy. Oh, yeah, it's impossible. He's written into the laws of nature this it's said it's central this policy

**00:34:08** Well, it's central said it

**00:34:10** Actually, you know, I was talking to a guy and he found a way to get around these central policies

**00:34:15** You just need somebody to like, I don't know like turn off your wi-fi and order an iphone for you

**00:34:20** But yeah, I think for someone who has a policy of not getting the big phone

**00:34:24** I feel like it was a pretty uninteresting year. The thing i'm most excited about is the overall camera package this year

**00:34:33** Okay

**00:34:34** Because at least from what they were talking about and you know

**00:34:37** We are still in the limbo stage of not actually having these phones and like there are while when we're recording

**00:34:43** There are no reviews there might be reviews by the time this episode comes out. I don't know right. Yeah

**00:34:48** We're still under all the embargoes. Well people are we're not I meant we isn't like the greater we the great

**00:34:54** Like the society is still under the embargoes last year

**00:34:57** They introduced the larger sensor the 48 megapixel sensor, right?

**00:35:00** And it enabled 48 megapixel images if you shoot in raw and then that was kind of the end of it

**00:35:06** Right the other thing that it did it brought the 2x back because they were just sample a certain portion of the sensor

**00:35:11** And I was very excited about the 48 megapixel sensor because I was looking forward to some big jumps in image quality

**00:35:17** But it just ended up not being a thing last year

**00:35:21** Because it just bended all the images down to 12 megapixels unless you went for the 48

**00:35:26** But now they have introduced kind of what I have been

**00:35:30** No, I was asking for but what I was asking for which is a new 24 megapixel default super high resolution image

**00:35:37** Where it is taking the data from the 48 megapixel sensor and putting it into their pipeline to create a better image at the end

**00:35:45** And what I think is fantastic is this is actually going to be on all the phones all four phones are getting this feature this year

**00:35:52** Which I think is great. And so they have done what I hope they would do

**00:35:56** Because I was a little let down with the sensor last time because I didn't really feel like I was getting what

**00:36:00** Was promised to me in a way. Yeah. Yeah, at least from the like the rumors beforehand, right?

**00:36:05** Like bigger sensor is going to be big news

**00:36:07** But I didn't really feel like I was getting a big change

**00:36:10** And my hope was that they would take the next year of it being on people's devices and work on it

**00:36:17** And generate something new at the end of it. And that's what they've done

**00:36:20** I don't believe that this changes the 14 pro I think because there is actually changes to the 48 megapixel sensor itself

**00:36:29** to enable for this new whatever

**00:36:32** These lenses need to have

**00:36:34** But now like all of the phones the 15 the 15 plus the 15 pro 15 max get this 48 megapixel sensor

**00:36:40** And the 24 megapixel super high resolution default

**00:36:44** Okay, that's a good point. I'm realizing I remember that part in the

**00:36:48** Presentation but I feel like I did not put that together about like oh the actual image being bigger part

**00:36:55** And get all of these presentations now like some of these numbers like they're just crazy big numbers, right?

**00:36:58** Or they're talking about different things and it's like there's sometimes in the yeah the technical detail sections

**00:37:04** It's like is this the part where I don't fully pay attention?

**00:37:07** Because you're just going to say that the numbers are bigger each time right or am I fully paying attention?

**00:37:11** Yeah, yeah, and there's stuff you need to see like, you know

**00:37:13** Like in the pro phones they're talking about like you can choose the focal distance or like the focal length for images

**00:37:20** And you know, it's just like

**00:37:22** I kind of vaguely understand what that means, you know, it's like but I don't know what it looks like for my iphone

**00:37:30** Right. So like I need to see that part

**00:37:32** But I can understand the concept that they're giving

**00:37:35** The other thing that i'm happy about is this is on the 14 now. It's in the final version of ios 17

**00:37:42** They've enabled a 48 megapixel heath file, which basically means

**00:37:48** It's not massive file sizes

**00:37:50** But you're able to take full advantage of the 48 megapixel sensor without going through the processing

**00:37:56** So if you want a full data high quality image, you're able to get that in a more compressed form

**00:38:02** So it's like, you know a couple of megabytes rather than a hundred megabytes. Yeah, that raw images in

**00:38:08** So that's great like i'm happy about these changes like I think it will make

**00:38:12** For a better default and that with the heath stuff will make it more likely for me to take

**00:38:17** The larger sensor images again

**00:38:19** I was shooting photos for a little while in the raw thing and then I realized very fast like oh, this is wildly

**00:38:24** And they're just hard to deal with right?

**00:38:26** It's complicated and now now it being in the heath format

**00:38:30** It's just what actually all iphone photos are currently in

**00:38:33** And now they've got this for the like the 48 megapixel sensor as well and there's other stuff like portrait mode

**00:38:40** They've made that

**00:38:42** What looks too much better you take a photo of a person and it captures the data of the portrait

**00:38:47** And you can later on turn it into a portrait mode image. Yeah, I mean importantly mike a photo of a person or a dog

**00:38:54** Sorry, how could I forget?

**00:38:56** This is literally my first note under the iphone section when I was watching the event was I was dog

**00:39:02** auto portrait exclamation mark

**00:39:05** I am really happy with that on the software side because I feel like that's a constant annoyance of

**00:39:11** Do I want to take a portrait mode photo here?

**00:39:14** And for me the main thing with that was always

**00:39:16** It's the trade-off with the live photo like the live photo is really valuable to have

**00:39:22** And so having to say like i'm gonna give up the live photo

**00:39:27** Because I think that this moment will make a good portrait photo

**00:39:30** It always felt like a bad kind of roll of the dice

**00:39:33** Like I don't want to be making this decision and like I really like the portrait mode

**00:39:38** I think over the years it's gotten so much better. You can get some great photos of it

**00:39:42** The first version was kind of shaky

**00:39:43** But like if you haven't tried it in a couple of years like the portrait mode thing

**00:39:47** I think looks really good and I have a bunch of photos where i'm very happy that I got them as portrait mode photos

**00:39:53** I typically go in and edit them and you can adjust the amount of blur

**00:39:58** Yeah, I typically will bring it down a little bit from the default

**00:40:01** But yeah the same like I have so many images now

**00:40:04** Like if i'm taking a picture of someone I will always also take a portrait photo now

**00:40:10** Like if someone's like hey take a picture of me like it's just you know, i'll go landscape

**00:40:14** Portrait and then portrait mode, you know, like i'll do like, you know, so you get them in buffs

**00:40:19** It's like I don't know maybe you want to post it on instagram stories

**00:40:21** So i've got to get a portrait image for you

**00:40:23** I don't do this for like

**00:40:24** Brandos in the street who asked me which I do get asked quite a lot

**00:40:27** I didn't always points this out people always ask me a lot to take photos of them

**00:40:31** I don't know what vibe I give off

**00:40:32** Anyway, like if it's of a friend or a family member, I also take like a portrait mode photo

**00:40:38** And so I like that now I wouldn't need to do this

**00:40:41** I hope that apple is able to work out at some point live portrait mode, right?

**00:40:46** If you're gonna allow me to do that if I can take a live photo and then turn it into a portrait mode later on

**00:40:52** Why can't I have the best of both worlds?

**00:40:53** I mean, they must be able to do that at some point because they basically do that with their cinematic mode

**00:40:58** I mean, that's what cinematic mode is exactly. That's what I think it's like let's do it

**00:41:03** Let's just go for it because as well like they've brought some of those cinematic mode ideas to portrait photos as well

**00:41:09** You can change what the focus is after the fact of the portrait photos

**00:41:14** So you've got two people you could change it to the other person. Yeah, that cinematic mode stuff is interesting

**00:41:19** I've actually just in the past like couple months i've noticed a few

**00:41:24** Like vloggers on youtube are clearly using cinematic mode on their phone to shoot stuff

**00:41:30** And I thought like oh, that's very interesting

**00:41:33** Like I think most people would never notice again, like if if you're working in this professionally

**00:41:37** It's very obvious straight away of like, okay. I can see that that's not a real

**00:41:41** Lens like this is being done with portrait mode on an iphone

**00:41:45** But I thought like oh, it's an interesting way to put like a soft blur on everyone

**00:41:51** Who is not the primary focus of the vlogger?

**00:41:54** I just I wondered like I wonder if this is just kind of

**00:41:57** Crossed over some useful threshold because it's just like turning up a little bit here and there

**00:42:03** But yeah, it does make me think about live portrait mode photos. Like it's the same idea. I wonder if it's just a

**00:42:10** Again, if it's like a computational processing problem, like they just can't do it fast enough

**00:42:15** But I don't know but either way i'm just really glad to not have to

**00:42:19** always do that small cognitive task of do I want this to be a normal photo or do I want this to be a

**00:42:26** Portrait photo and all joking aside

**00:42:29** It really is serious about it being for dogs, right?

**00:42:32** I think like for dogs and kids you never know what they're going to do, right?

**00:42:36** They're not like patiently waiting for their photo to be taken

**00:42:39** So that's why the trade-off is like a harder trade-off to make in those circumstances

**00:42:43** But of course the thing we haven't mentioned on the pro

**00:42:46** Is the five times zoom lens five times zoom is a lot of zoom

**00:42:50** I'm not going to be able to make a decision about this until I use it. I'm not like really excited about it though

**00:42:57** Why not? Why aren't you all into the big zoom big phone big zoom? I've wanted it as an option

**00:43:04** Like i'm not sure how I feel about 1x 2x 5x like that jump from two to five

**00:43:10** Is quite a lot. Oh

**00:43:12** That is I would have ideally liked a fourth lens at each of the phone

**00:43:16** Like so I got one two three and five like that would have been my ideal

**00:43:20** Hmm

**00:43:21** And so i'm not going to know really until I use it like maybe two

**00:43:26** X will do most of the time what I need and then I have the 5x

**00:43:30** Like for things that need that and that's just like a better option than 3x was

**00:43:34** I don't know like this is going to have to be one of those things

**00:43:37** I'm not going to be able to judge for a while like it's very impressive like the images on their website

**00:43:42** It's very impressive what you can get for a 5x zoom

**00:43:45** but i'm just not sure

**00:43:48** that that's what I

**00:43:50** Need yeah, you know, it's funny. I didn't think about it because it's like

**00:43:54** I think their 5x is like 120 millimeter equivalent. I wasn't really thinking that is that right? Is it 120 120?

**00:44:00** yeah, like that's what I used to shoot when I was the second shooter for weddings and

**00:44:06** 120 lets you get very far away

**00:44:09** Like that was the purpose of using that lens is to get natural photos of people because they just don't even realize that they're

**00:44:14** They're getting their photo taken you get all the like oh, here's the family just acting natural at the dinner kind of photos

**00:44:20** Because people just don't tune into it the good photos. They're different from the portraiture photos. Yeah, I like candid

**00:44:26** That's that's my favorite. Yeah, and I liked being the candid photographer because then I could be further away from everyone

**00:44:33** With them, right? It's like

**00:44:35** Right. That's why I had that job and my wife had the job of doing all the formal photos

**00:44:38** It's like I don't have to interact with anyone back here

**00:44:40** But it is a like in my use of the phone whenever I punched into 3x

**00:44:45** I've never felt like I wish it was more

**00:44:48** Whereas I have felt that when it was just the 2x zoom was like oh if I could just get a little closer

**00:44:52** That'd be great. Yeah, but the 3x for everything that i'm taking photos of normally that's as far as I ever want to go

**00:44:59** And yeah 120 millimeters is that's really far with 5x

**00:45:04** The thing that i'm wondering about with that is because I do agree with you

**00:45:07** But the pause that I have in my mind is like is there just things that I think there's no point taking a photo of this

**00:45:12** Yeah, that's true. And so I don't and like now

**00:45:16** I might be able to and so

**00:45:19** Maybe that will be good. The jury is out for me

**00:45:23** On this lens where like for everything else i'm like, yes

**00:45:26** This is what I was hoping they would do

**00:45:28** And now I just need to make sure that it lives up to what the presentation shows, you know

**00:45:32** So you're still definitely getting the big phone then for oh, I mean, there's no doubt like there's no doubt because like for me

**00:45:37** It's not anything other than the screen

**00:45:40** Like it doesn't matter what else they do

**00:45:43** I buy the big phone and i've always bought the big phone because I want the biggest screen

**00:45:47** Right, right

**00:45:48** Like for watching videos for reading messages for reading web pages

**00:45:52** Like I always want the biggest screen iphone that I can get it's the device I use like

**00:45:58** All day every day like now it's on the standby mode. I want a nice big screen for the standby mode like

**00:46:05** That's just my preference big screen for standby mode would be nice. Yeah, there's loads of great reasons to get the big phone

**00:46:12** Mike always always the big phone evangelist. Oh, that's me, man

**00:46:17** I've been in the pocket for a bit of big phone for a really long time now

**00:46:21** What do you think about the titanium this is one of those things

**00:46:25** I have to wait to see it in person. It's hard to judge. So our friends on the ground

**00:46:31** Okay, so like people like jason and steven

**00:46:34** They've all been telling me that it is

**00:46:37** very noticeably lighter

**00:46:40** So lighter to me feels like the kind of thing that it can be a double-edged sword. I just kind of wonder how that feels

**00:46:47** Maybe it's a bit like there's some kind of uncanny valley of lightness where ultimately you want the phone to feel like nothing

**00:46:55** Right, you want it to feel just like a almost massless object. That's just a piece of glass, right? That's where we're headed with these things

**00:47:02** But there's some amount of weight which feels nice and solid

**00:47:05** and I think the current generation of phone really

**00:47:10** hits a

**00:47:11** feels nice in the hand sort of weight size ratio

**00:47:16** So I mean I suspect i'll just be happier with a lighter phone

**00:47:19** But this is why like I would be curious to see it in person and to just see

**00:47:24** How does this actually feel?

**00:47:26** Do our friends on the ground like the lightness because saying that it feels lighter is different from saying that they like it. Yeah

**00:47:32** Everybody seems to be excited about it. I mean I am happier for thinner bezels, right?

**00:47:36** Like i'm always happier for that like even if we're just like decreasing the physical size of the phone by 2%

**00:47:41** And making the bezels smaller like I think that's nice. So that's great for the case either way

**00:47:46** the other thing of course just with the titanium to me is like

**00:47:50** the colors

**00:47:52** This is actual color and this does this is in everything. I don't understand what's going on

**00:47:58** Like I was just talking about us with jason the other day because there was recently was the 25th anniversary of the iMac

**00:48:06** and

**00:48:07** He was on the talk show with jon Gruber and they were talking about

**00:48:11** beige computers

**00:48:12** And then the iMac came in and it was big and bright and colorful, right?

**00:48:17** And I was just thinking about like what computers look like now

**00:48:20** and by and large they are

**00:48:23** Metallic tones. Yeah, it's silver. Everything's silver and like

**00:48:27** Will we ever get something now that comes in and it's like here we go. It's new and i'm not sure we will now

**00:48:34** I think because what at least with what we have like I can't imagine

**00:48:38** a phone or a laptop or something like bursting into the scene and being like this is upending everything with its brand new design because

**00:48:46** These things are just all about screens now. Yeah. Yeah, it's just about a screen

**00:48:50** And so like I figure maybe something that's like a new device

**00:48:54** Right, then like the ones that we're currently using might be the thing that comes in and changes what it means to look

**00:48:59** What a computer will look like

**00:49:01** Yeah, it's just like, you know, I was hoping for something

**00:49:05** A little more like the iphone 15

**00:49:09** I don't like the colors particularly but I like what they're doing right with like this

**00:49:16** Color infused glass like all of the images look really interesting like it's got this kind of like

**00:49:21** weird

**00:49:22** frosted

**00:49:24** And like the color pools in certain areas like it looks interesting like visually interesting

**00:49:30** and the pro phone is like

**00:49:32** Here is four

**00:49:34** just

**00:49:35** tones

**00:49:37** This again was a laugh out loud moment for me when they said and it comes in four great colors, right?

**00:49:41** And they have it zoomed in so you don't see the phones in full. It's like guys

**00:49:46** We need to sit down and have a review as a class of what a color is. There's one color

**00:49:51** There's one color, right? There's one color

**00:49:54** And it's with an asterisk again. This is one of these like I want to see it in person

**00:49:58** It's it's hard to tell kind of things. I was like that is not four colors guys

**00:50:03** My macbook air is the midnight one, right?

**00:50:08** And this is steven said to me that it looks like that. All right, that's sort of what I was expecting

**00:50:12** Yeah, which is like the least blue something could be but blue

**00:50:16** Yeah, if I was like giving things a grade

**00:50:18** It feels like it's a student who's trying to like just barely pass with a thing. It's like yes

**00:50:23** That is technically a color right midnight blue is like you've just crossed the threshold into blue

**00:50:30** I don't know like I just I just reached behind me to one of my old iphones and it like it still kills me

**00:50:35** I've got the the one that they actually did the pro one that was really blue. I think this is the 13

**00:50:41** It's like that one year they made one that was beautiful and actually blue like no one would disagree that it was blue

**00:50:48** It's like I bought it. I loved it

**00:50:50** It was one of my favorite phones ever and it's like and we only did it that once like why?

**00:50:57** I've been trying to like talk myself into this question. It's like, okay gray

**00:51:02** maybe

**00:51:03** Like think about this for a minute like maybe the richest company on earth knows something that you don't about colors

**00:51:09** And there's a reason that they're not doing real colors on their phones

**00:51:13** Do you think you know better than them for what colors their phone should be and a reasonable answer to that is no

**00:51:19** Right. I don't know better the richest company on earth probably does know better what colors to make their phone

**00:51:24** But then it still seems crazy to me

**00:51:28** and you even talk about the regular iphones again when they introduced it they

**00:51:33** zoomed in real close on the pink one and so it looks like it's actually like a bold bright

**00:51:40** I mean this would be the year for it. It looked for a second like oh, they made like a barbie pink phone

**00:51:46** And then they zoom back out and it's like oh no

**00:51:48** It's a little bit more like they put some drops of pink dye in milk. That's what it actually looks like

**00:51:55** It's like make it pink like am I crazy?

**00:51:58** I think you'd sell a billion of them if you made it like really pink make the green one really green

**00:52:04** You know don't make it milk, but a little green. I don't know that's

**00:52:10** We say this every year, but every year i'm like continually baffled anew by this. I don't get it

**00:52:15** I don't get it at all

**00:52:16** It does make you feel like you're you're losing the plot a bit, right?

**00:52:20** Because it is that thing of like surely they know but like am I the only like what is happening?

**00:52:25** Is it just us who wants these like it's the weird thing of like is it just me and?

**00:52:31** Everyone I know like it's one of the things that my wife complained about immediately like what are these colors?

**00:52:37** What happened to my gold phone like nope no gold phone for you?

**00:52:41** Everyone I talked to they want to know like why doesn't apple make colors like I don't know. I just don't get it

**00:52:46** I don't know if I can really talk myself into I know better than apple on this one, but

**00:52:52** I would pay

**00:52:53** Real money to be the fly on the wall at whatever meetings they have when they decide colors like I just want to know like

**00:53:01** What's your reasons like there's got to be reasons right there can't just not be reasons

**00:53:07** I don't know

**00:53:10** It really bugs me like I just I just want to like a nice blue phone like they made that one time

**00:53:16** But I don't know maybe like i'm the only guy who bought the blue one and that's why they don't make it

**00:53:21** Is it me that is wrong?

**00:53:24** No, it is the apple who is wrong

**00:53:27** I am intrigued about the titanium, you know for me i'm sad that they got rid of the gold

**00:53:32** But it's something different and so sometimes I just want different i've done the gold phone for a few years now

**00:53:39** And so i'm also gonna we'll talk about this in a second. I'm gonna treat myself to an apple watch ultra this year

**00:53:44** and

**00:53:45** The natural titanium iPhone looks like it will kind of match with the apple watch ultra and I guess I can live with that

**00:53:51** I do really like the brushed metal look

**00:53:53** Yeah, I think that's cool

**00:53:54** But I like i'm hugely biased here because I've like i've had the brushed metal on my wedding ring for forever

**00:53:59** Like I just really like that look that I do like on the case

**00:54:03** But yes, you're gonna get the apple watch ultra, huh? Yeah, I was hoping

**00:54:08** I was hoping for a little a little more

**00:54:11** Were you hoping for an update because I have waited

**00:54:16** For the best part of a year like maybe like nine months

**00:54:21** The thing is like I don't care whether they update or not specifically

**00:54:26** But it is weird to me that they did update it and they updated it with so

**00:54:31** Little

**00:54:32** Like a brighter screen. This is the same for both watches brighter screens faster processors ultra wideband 2 and the faster processor has this like

**00:54:42** Tapping with your

**00:54:44** finger and thumb

**00:54:46** Thing to do stuff in the ui I think they call it double tap which is very

**00:54:51** Reminiscent of how you interact that's not reminiscent is the way you interact with vision pro. Well mike. It's only

**00:54:57** Reminiscent of this for someone who has

**00:55:00** right

**00:55:05** I cannot reminisce about what it was like to use the vision pro. Thank you very much

**00:55:11** Yes, well, it's like that

**00:55:13** For those of us who've had the opportunity so reminiscence, don't you think not really? No, I don't

**00:55:20** Do you remember that time?

**00:55:21** So it's this interest i'm intrigued to see what this will look like

**00:55:25** This isn't necessarily something that I would have up and I don't think anybody should upgrade that apple watch for this feature

**00:55:32** Specifically, but I am ready like I have a series seven

**00:55:36** So and I get like 11 hours battery life on my watch now every day. He's just driving me mad

**00:55:42** So like i'm ready for an upgrade so that feature where you tap your fingers together the reminiscent one

**00:55:47** That has existed on the watch as an accessibility feature

**00:55:51** I like stumbled upon it one day and I turned it on just to try it

**00:55:56** I tried it for a little while and

**00:55:59** It's interesting now i'll just grant that whatever version they currently have is better than the accessibility version

**00:56:07** which was a little

**00:56:09** I'm about to say the word gross

**00:56:11** But I mean I mean gross as opposed to fine like your movements had to be sort of gross to make it work

**00:56:17** So assuming that they make the movement a little bit better and a bit more precise

**00:56:22** My experience was that there was still kind of a like fundamental ui problem here in that

**00:56:28** You never exactly knew

**00:56:31** What the gesture was going to do?

**00:56:34** Yeah, they describe it as like oh when you do this gesture when you tap your fingers together, it will perform the default action

**00:56:41** I think the difference that we'll find here is that

**00:56:44** As an accessibility feature, it was just like trying to plug in to the system

**00:56:50** When now the system watchos apps have been designed with this in mind

**00:56:55** So maybe it will do the thing you're expecting

**00:56:59** But that is a very weird

**00:57:03** User experience challenge. Yeah, you have to anticipate what the user will want to do

**00:57:11** And they will do a thing and it's got to do that and if it works

**00:57:17** 95% at a time it's still not enough

**00:57:20** Which is the complicated thing, right? Like yeah every time somebody wants to do a thing and they tap their

**00:57:27** thumb and finger together

**00:57:29** And it does a different thing is going to be annoying. So this is a very intriguing thing and look at the moment

**00:57:36** This is only in apple's apps there is no api for this third-party apps cannot use this feature

**00:57:43** Maybe that's why like it's got to be a bit more refined and thought through I don't know

**00:57:49** But what's different here is that the new processor is enabled this feature

**00:57:55** to

**00:57:56** Be more reliable

**00:57:58** So they're able to roll it out

**00:57:59** It's just like a system thing rather than just the accessibility thing that has existed before

**00:58:04** Yeah, I mean I never I never had any problem like again once you sort of learn what is it looking for?

**00:58:08** I never had any problem with it not registering. Right am I doing the double tap?

**00:58:12** I still think it's it's not even a question of predicting what the user does even in their demo

**00:58:18** It highlights what I think is a weird problem of when someone calls you you do the gesture to answer

**00:58:25** But it's the same gesture to end the phone call. And I think that that's just

**00:58:31** There's just like a little cognitive hurdle every time that one makes sense to me because it's like if someone calls you

**00:58:37** You put your air pods in you click the button and then when you're done you click the button again

**00:58:41** like that's what they're trying to build on right of like

**00:58:45** What is the thing that you're most likely to do at any point?

**00:58:48** So they showed an example of the alarm went off

**00:58:51** Yeah, and the lady tapped her thumb and finger together and the alarm stopped that it was like the reason I turned it on

**00:58:57** Was exactly that use case right? It's competing with the nose tap right? No more nose tapping. That's what they're trying to do here

**00:59:02** So i'll try it out

**00:59:05** I'll be curious to see if there is a new version, but I was just aware of like I tried it for a while

**00:59:09** I tried to make it work

**00:59:11** And I just found the slight cognitive overhead of what is it going to do here?

**00:59:17** Yeah, a little weird that was even with the ui would like highlight

**00:59:21** It would it would still make it very clear if you were looking at the phone like which button is it going to press or what's going

**00:59:26** To happen, but I just still found it like awkward each time and it was

**00:59:31** Weirdly more natural to just keep doing nose tapping like i've been doing all of these years

**00:59:36** That's there is a precision in that and at least you're making a choice

**00:59:39** Yeah, i'm making a choice. And also if it doesn't work, you know why you were using your nose

**00:59:44** So maybe you're more forgiving about it. Yeah, you're more forgiving of the errors

**00:59:48** And also if we were to reminisce about the way that the vision pro gesture works

**00:59:53** The advantage that the vision pro has is it knows exactly what you're looking at?

**00:59:58** So I can imagine there it just feels so much more natural

**01:00:02** Because the system knows like you're looking at this thing again

**01:00:06** Like in a way that is even hard for me to explain is it was precise in a way that I could not even explain to you

**01:00:12** And this is a thing that you will all get to experience one day including

**01:00:17** but like this idea that like

**01:00:20** You don't really know where you're looking

**01:00:22** Like this was the thing that was really surprising to me

**01:00:25** That it felt like honestly if it was reading my mind is what it felt like because

**01:00:31** I would want to do a thing

**01:00:33** And most of the time all I would need to do is just tap

**01:00:37** My fingers together and the thing would happen

**01:00:41** Because I was looking there

**01:00:43** like there didn't need to be a lot of

**01:00:46** Negotiation between my brain and my fingers because my eyes were just in the middle doing the thing for me

**01:00:53** Yeah, it was very peculiar and this obviously isn't going to be like that because it's quite limited

**01:00:59** But yeah, this is coming in October to the apple watches

**01:01:02** My hope would be that there might be a developer story between now and then but that doesn't seem to be one

**01:01:07** Yeah, and because that will be weird to me right that like if this is the thing that only apples apps can do is like

**01:01:13** Well, that's not helpful

**01:01:14** Yeah, but I don't know I could also see that being the case just in

**01:01:18** like the reason this feature is interesting at all to think about is

**01:01:22** It feels like the first step along with the vision pro of maybe apple trying to build up some kind of

**01:01:29** physical language interface with the system like that's what this is. Yeah, i'm on board with that, but like if it's going to

**01:01:38** Truly work and catch on with people it needs to be as ubiquitous as possible

**01:01:43** Yes, and if there's only a subset of applications that it works in people aren't going to build it into their muscle memory

**01:01:51** If every time you want to check the weather

**01:01:53** And you want to like I don't know what it would be like a show

**01:01:57** Switch from weekly to daily forecast or whatever

**01:02:00** And it doesn't work in the weather app that you use where you're going to stop doing it

**01:02:04** You know what? I mean like I think that's the weirdness about it

**01:02:06** But yeah, i'm excited about getting an apple watch ultra. I love the way the thing looks like I like the screen

**01:02:13** You know, it's bigger than I want overall like physically not the screen like the actual case of the watch

**01:02:19** I'm not a huge fan of the crown guard like the part that sticks out of the side

**01:02:25** Yeah, and i'm also not a big fan of the fact that there is a big orange button. I know ways

**01:02:30** I like the orange button

**01:02:32** Some of the time and like i'm gonna get two watch bands that will have orange in them because it will match but

**01:02:39** When i'm wearing a suit

**01:02:42** Sometimes I still want to wear my apple watch and I have a gold apple watch and I put the gold

**01:02:46** Milanese band on it and I think it dresses it up

**01:02:50** I don't think it's as easy to dress something up in a way that I like when there's orange all over the thing

**01:02:55** There is no dressing up the apple watch ultra

**01:02:57** I don't think you can make that thing look fancy for a fancy party

**01:03:01** Like it's just not going to happen

**01:03:03** You know

**01:03:03** I have a couple of watches that I love and that I haven't worn in a long time and maybe they will get used

**01:03:08** A little bit more once I move over to the apple watch ultra

**01:03:11** But apple you kill me like I just want to be able to continue getting all of my fitness stuff

**01:03:15** And I can't if I want to wear a nice watch because you put orange on the watch, you know, like that's the

**01:03:22** The trade-off. Yeah, I think the biggest surprise for all three of us watching the event that all of us were like

**01:03:27** Oh my god, really was apple ultra watch too. It's like, okay

**01:03:30** So the upgrades are minor like they've done basically nothing to upgrade it

**01:03:34** But surely they're about to tell us about their new color once again and it was like nope

**01:03:41** Gray they used all the color on the iphones

**01:03:44** Oh

**01:03:46** It's all I don't think you saw them. They saw it's all there. You didn't want to get black titanium. Yeah, I just like

**01:03:55** I was just

**01:03:57** Completely blown away. I was like all of these minor upgrades

**01:04:01** Surely they are in service of the fact that there's actually a new color like nope

**01:04:07** All of us were shocked in that room. It was unbelievable

**01:06:22** Our thanks to factor for their support of this show and all of relay fm

**01:06:27** Should we do some ask cortex questions? Yeah, let's do some ask cortex. Love it. Libra asks

**01:06:32** How many tabs do you have open on average?

**01:06:34** And for gray, how many tabs do you tend to have open during a research stint?

**01:06:39** Ooh, uh, why don't you go first mike? All right, so I am a tab group

**01:06:45** User, okay. Okay

**01:06:47** So the way that I work is on my macbook air which is the machine I do most of my work from I do have a bunch

**01:06:52** Of tabs open there and just like the non-grouped tabs section

**01:06:56** And that tends to be around 10 tabs and this is usually like things that I want to remember

**01:07:02** Or things that i'm tracking for a limited time and then it's going to go away

**01:07:06** Like I have like a tab which has our saint jude page on it and stuff, right?

**01:07:09** So like these are just like temporary things and keeping my eye on and then they go

**01:07:13** Uh-huh, but outside of that I am very heavy on tab groups. I have five tab groups relay fm

**01:07:20** recording cortex brand home vacation

**01:07:23** And I say home and vacation. They are like here's a thing that I found that I might want to get for my house

**01:07:30** I'll put it in this tab group and then one day i'll get to it

**01:07:32** It's like a little storage and similarly forget vacations if we're going on a vacation

**01:07:37** That's where i'll put like the restaurants that I like and then i'll go through them and pick the ones that I want

**01:07:41** And put them into tripsy

**01:07:43** then cortex brand

**01:07:45** And relay fm. I feel like a pretty self-explanatory, right? Like these are the tabs that I have open that are related to

**01:07:54** These businesses so it's all the various

**01:07:58** Websites and web services that I use like for the relay fm one

**01:08:02** It's got the tabs open for our publishing systems and that kind of stuff i'm excited for maca was sonoma

**01:08:08** That you will be able to be

**01:08:11** Like there's like a new kind of thing I think it's called profiles

**01:08:15** So you'll be able to be signed in

**01:08:18** to

**01:08:19** Accounts for the same service in different profiles. I'll have a relay fm profile and a cortex brand profile

**01:08:27** So I could be signed in to say two different youtube accounts on each one or whatever stuff like that

**01:08:31** Actually, have you used the beta at all on the map? No, I haven't used it. Okay. I don't mess around with the mac OS base

**01:08:38** That's danger town for me that's too far. Yeah, i'm just realizing like I don't have any idea how that works with

**01:08:45** With the tab groups like does it just change what things you're signed into or is there a whole different group of tab groups?

**01:08:51** It sits above tab groups. Okay, so inside of the I think nicole profiles, but inside of these profiles

**01:08:57** You can then have tab groups so you can have separate tab groups for different profiles. Correct. What you're saying. Yeah

**01:09:03** Oh, and I think once you set these up on the mac they don't sync to your other devices

**01:09:07** Oh, that's intriguing. So i'm pretty excited to try some of that out, but it might not stick

**01:09:11** I might not like it. It might be too many clicks

**01:09:13** But i'm gonna give it a go and see see what I think

**01:09:16** But then the last one is the recording tab group, which is like

**01:09:19** This is the limited set of tabs that I have open when i'm recording a show

**01:09:23** Which will be like the cms ad system and whatever show document i'm working on except for cortex where it's in notion

**01:09:31** What about you?

**01:09:34** So I have kind of a weird setup here that is not a surprise

**01:09:40** Mike what is a tab? Right?

**01:09:43** Here we go

**01:09:44** I feel like for years I was a big proponent of something like tab groups in safari and then we got tab groups

**01:09:50** And I really like them, but there's one part of this which just

**01:09:54** Kills me every time still

**01:09:57** Which is that like the default tab group in some sense is this local only tab group

**01:10:03** That doesn't sync across devices

**01:10:06** I find this just

**01:10:08** Very infuriating to work with for a bunch of reasons like it kills me that this the whole thing doesn't sync

**01:10:14** The analogy I always use is it's like if in the notes app every time you made a new note that note was

**01:10:19** Only saved on that device and you had to manually put it into the sync folder if you wanted it to sync everywhere

**01:10:26** Like I think that would just be obviously crazy

**01:10:28** But whatever they've made a decision that when you click a link it opens in like the local tab group and fine

**01:10:34** Whatever. I find that frustrating, but it's something that i've gotten used to over time that I now don't think about it anymore

**01:10:41** Yeah, I think this is like the computer version of what we were talking about before with

**01:10:45** Having goals or like things that you did because of your past self like this to me just totally reads as

**01:10:52** It works this way because this is the way browsers have always worked with just the local stuff

**01:10:56** But if you were building a browser today, you would never make this design decision

**01:11:00** Like if you were starting from scratch, no one would do it like this

**01:11:04** But so I so cannot live with this that what i've been doing

**01:11:08** This whole year is I have two browsers and my default browser is actually I cannot believe i'm about to say these words

**01:11:17** My default browser is microsoft edge

**01:11:23** He's been bingpilled

**01:11:26** I have i've been bingpilled you are living proof for why microsoft has invested

**01:11:32** So many millions of dollars into this stuff

**01:11:36** It was just to get you to use bing

**01:11:40** Rewind two years ago and like ask my past self like hey

**01:11:45** Two years from now you're gonna set microsoft edge as the default web browser on your computer

**01:11:52** Why do you think this will happen? I would have no ability to describe that future scenario

**01:11:57** I'll be like, uh, I don't know. I had a brain concussion and like couldn't think straightly anymore

**01:12:02** Like I have no idea why I would do that kind of thing

**01:12:05** So yeah edge is my default browser. You are right. It is because I have been bingpilled

**01:12:11** And I do want to use bing as my main search engine

**01:12:15** I think bing with their bing chat just like is just straight up better than google in a lot of scenarios

**01:12:21** So I do want to use that. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Let me just finish one thing here. Okay. Okay. If it was

**01:12:27** only that

**01:12:29** I probably wouldn't be using microsoft edge as the default one like I do like it

**01:12:33** But like what's the marginal increase in value over something like google or duck duck go?

**01:12:38** I think it's better, but it's not like enough better to be running an entire separate browser

**01:12:42** It's the combination of these two things that safari has a really annoying feature

**01:12:48** So I want to use safari in a different way, which i'll get to in a second

**01:12:52** And so then if I am going to have another browser which browser is it going to be that's going to be the default?

**01:13:00** I click on a link and I know that this link isn't going to sync anywhere

**01:13:04** It's just like living in this browser on my computer in that context making the decision

**01:13:09** Then if I use edge I can use bing is like the deciding factor for what is the other browser

**01:13:16** Okay, do you use the vertical tab thing that they made?

**01:13:20** Uh, I forgot they even did that. I think I tried that for like a day and I hated it

**01:13:24** Okay, I just wondered like there are a few things that people like about edge

**01:13:28** This is one of those things of like

**01:13:30** It's a different way of doing things that maybe works differently better with other people's brains

**01:13:34** Like the tabs are in a sidebar rather than at the top of it

**01:13:38** What I was woeing about oh actually before I get to that

**01:13:42** This is very funny because we need to back up three levels now about my yeah, we're many many parentheses down at this point

**01:13:50** I'm very happy that we did this question today because I don't

**01:13:54** Know that this would have come up in state of the apps. Like I can't imagine having asked what browser are you using?

**01:14:01** You know, we need a browser category now for state of the apps

**01:14:05** I now have another question before I get to the question that I wanted to get to which is do you use this on your

**01:14:09** iPhone too to use edge on your iPhone. I actually do use edge on my iPhone

**01:14:13** I feel like you have to like this is this is a thing like if you use a browser

**01:14:18** You have to use that browser everywhere in my opinion

**01:14:21** Because yeah, like this is why I use the chrome app for like a really really long time because when I was using chrome

**01:14:27** Well, you've got to use the browser you're using because you've got all your history there or you're like synced tabs and stuff

**01:14:32** It's all in there. You can't just

**01:14:34** Flip-flop between browsers. I think it's wild that people do that. I have an exception to that which is okay

**01:14:40** I don't use edge on my iPad

**01:14:42** But it's just because I have a very different use case on my iPad show moments entirely reading

**01:14:48** and they're just um

**01:14:50** Edges reader mode is so much worse than safaris reader mode

**01:14:54** I'm willing to make the trade the other way, but it's just like I have a very particular use case for the iPad

**01:14:59** Yeah, my phone. Yeah, it's edge. So the question I wanted to ask you was

**01:15:03** Like how much are you actually using?

**01:15:07** The being ai's such I mean i'm using it in every case when I would have used google two years ago

**01:15:15** Why is it better for you though like in searching?

**01:15:18** Like what is the chat search?

**01:15:21** Providing that is better than like a web search. So there's two things

**01:15:26** I have felt for years like the quality of search engine results has just gotten worse across all search engines

**01:15:32** I think that's just a byproduct of

**01:15:34** Seo yeah, it's like seo has ruined the internet. It's people like knowing what to target

**01:15:39** It's that problem of uh, like oh page rank is a genius idea until everyone knows that you're using page rank and then they game the system

**01:15:47** So it has been a problem for years for me that like search engines are obviously less useful than they used to be

**01:15:55** and so one of the things that I find really useful about bing is that it is

**01:15:59** functionally

**01:16:01** Looking at something like the first two pages of search results and summarizing them for you

**01:16:06** Like that's functionally what it's doing. So instead of just going to google

**01:16:10** And then I have to be like, okay, which of this is spam seo garbage?

**01:16:15** And which isn't?

**01:16:16** Bing is functionally doing that it's not that the search results themselves

**01:16:21** If you just go to bing and like see what url's returns are that different?

**01:16:26** It's that it is then doing the thing that I would do which is look at all of these and try to make some kind of judgment

**01:16:32** About which of these is the actual good one, but why do you think you can trust its answer?

**01:16:38** well, so the reason I like bing is because

**01:16:41** When it gives you the answer it also gives you the link to click and see where did that come from? Okay. So

**01:16:49** Again, just the way i'm using a search engine is i'm never

**01:16:52** Looking for the search engine to give me the answer i'm looking for where the answer is

**01:16:58** Yeah, the end result for me is that i'm always clicking on one of the things that bing tells me about with the footnote

**01:17:05** And yeah, totally sometimes I click that link and I mean it's like it's the same story like with the citation links on wikipedia

**01:17:12** Right, you click the link you're like, oh, hey, I found that over here and you click it and it's like the thing doesn't say remotely

**01:17:17** What you just said it said but that effect again

**01:17:20** Isn't that different from just using a regular search engine? Sure

**01:17:24** I mean if you're using a search engine the way you use it, which is not how people use search engines, right?

**01:17:30** Like how do you think people use search engines? Like they're they're searching for things for answers like and they

**01:17:36** Take the answer that the engine gives them. They don't be like, oh, let me go get the citation for this

**01:17:42** I am also one of these people like I am searching for the answer

**01:17:46** I only want the answer. I don't want how did we get here?

**01:17:51** Right, like that's the difference. Yeah between you and I think most other users

**01:17:57** But so in some sense what you're saying is that you're looking for like google gives you a little summary box at the top, right?

**01:18:02** So you're

**01:18:04** Most of the time when you're googling something you're really just looking for that summary box

**01:18:08** Like tell me what the answer is. Is that what you mean? If it has one, that's where i'll start

**01:18:12** Right and like and if that seems to make sense to me then i'm going to go with it doesn't mean it's true

**01:18:17** I think that is more of the average users or more typical users

**01:18:23** Experience of a search engine. I can give you another use case of like why is being really useful?

**01:18:29** I think the key with a lot of ai tech

**01:18:32** in its current state is

**01:18:35** Most of the value is not in the initial question. It's your ability to refine

**01:18:40** It's your ability to refine the question as time goes on

**01:18:44** So you say like i'm looking for this and then it gives you results and you're like, ah, but more like that

**01:18:49** And then it can do this

**01:18:50** One of the things i'm using big for is trying to find

**01:18:54** Where am I going to do the next?

**01:18:56** Grecation right well like find me a hotel and I can do the thing which is like hey i'm looking for a hotel

**01:19:02** It's got to be within like easy train access from central london

**01:19:06** I'm trying to find places that have air conditioning like there should be a supermarket nearby and a gym if possible and like all of this

**01:19:13** Kind of nonsense have you ever asked bing if an air conditioning unit can go to 16 degrees celsius

**01:19:18** Look if I could get bing to call the front desk and ask them

**01:19:21** What is the real temperature in the room? I would 100 percent do that. How far away are we from that?

**01:19:26** I don't think that far. I don't think we're that far

**01:19:29** No, it's never been google did that a couple of years ago and people were super mad and now look at us now

**01:19:34** Look at us again. It's like oh the first person who does the demo

**01:19:37** How outrageous and then you just wait 18 months and it's like it doesn't have this feature outrageous. That's what happens

**01:19:43** You can't make a call for me useless. Yeah, but so

**01:19:47** One of the things that is really useful here is

**01:19:50** Bing has a like a limit for how many times you can go back and forth

**01:19:55** but

**01:19:56** For a task where it's like oh, I know i'm going to do this thing

**01:19:59** Multiple times like i'm not just trying to find the one answer now

**01:20:02** I've actually started a little habit of making text documents that are related to

**01:20:08** questions that I ask

**01:20:09** And so what I have is something to like paste into bing now, which is i'm looking for a hotel with these qualities

**01:20:18** And you can preempt it when you've previously used it, you know, it gives you a suggestion of three hotels

**01:20:23** But then the next time you search you can tell it like this one was no good because of this

**01:20:28** This one is more like what I was looking for because of why

**01:20:32** And it clearly does get better at that and then doesn't waste time suggesting things that it suggested in the past

**01:20:38** So i'm very slowly building up a little library of like frequent queries

**01:20:43** That get a bit more precise each time based on what happened last time. Pretty sure they call that prompt engineering, you know

**01:20:51** Yeah, I know i'm a prompt engineer. This is the the future of work, right? Obviously, this is what we're all going to do

**01:20:57** So, I don't know

**01:20:58** I don't know if that answers your question about why do I find being useful?

**01:21:01** But those are the two things is like being

**01:21:04** Unlike something like chat gpt which just tells you a story and you have no idea why chat gpt thinks the thing that it does

**01:21:12** Bing actually gives you the link of like here's why I think this and you can go look

**01:21:17** And then the ability to like refine searches in an iterated way over time is very useful

**01:21:24** So what you're saying is when it comes to web search is citation needed. Yes citation needed citation needed. It gets enough

**01:21:31** So this is why microsoft edge is my default web browser is I do want to use bing

**01:21:37** And I want to have it just very clear to me that when I open a link

**01:21:40** It's going to go into this place and I know that this browser works like web browsers have worked for a thousand years

**01:21:46** And that the tabs don't go anywhere. They just live on whatever computer that i'm on

**01:21:50** And so on my edge browser on my different devices

**01:21:53** It's just links of like whatever I happen to open that I haven't closed since last time and that's

**01:21:59** Pretty tight like five tabs at most like because i'm really just looking up something. That's all it is

**01:22:05** but safari has now become the place because of tab groups that is the

**01:22:12** This is where I can now have

**01:22:15** All of the things that i'm looking at for the various projects that i'm working on

**01:22:20** And I just love this like tab groups are so good for me for this of the ability to just open up like

**01:22:27** Endless tabs that are on a topic and know that they will sync across devices. Can't you do this in bing?

**01:22:33** Why do you do this in safari? It doesn't work the same way. Okay

**01:22:37** This is one of these like the devils in the details lots of browsers if you look at a feature list will say

**01:22:43** Oh, we have tabs that sync but it's always in some slightly annoying way

**01:22:47** Whereas the safari one is just seen. Can't you just ask the search engine? Hey sync my tabs because now bing

**01:22:55** Yeah, what i'm gonna do is i'll ask bing. Hey bing

**01:22:57** Can you iteratively self improve and I would like you to have a syncing tab

**01:23:01** so just like learn how to code yourself and improve yourself and

**01:23:05** How could this possibly be the beginning of the end of the world?

**01:23:10** Just be like hey, you just remember all these urls, please just do that for me

**01:23:14** Please and then i'll come back to you every day and say where are my urls and then you can

**01:23:19** Yeah, so I looked into it I forget exactly how the like syncing works for microsoft

**01:23:24** But it's like it's not as seamless as safari. There's some reason it's slightly annoying

**01:23:28** I can't remember the details right now, but the safari one is just great. It's just automatic

**01:23:33** like when I open up my safari now, I just have a list of

**01:23:38** I've got about 20 tab groups that are all related to some project. Wow

**01:23:42** that sort of overstates it because what often happens is

**01:23:46** This is why I was like, oh there's profiles for safari

**01:23:49** Tell me more because what I what I really want is I want folders for my tab groups

**01:23:54** Because I want to distinguish visually much more clearly

**01:23:57** These are inactive projects or these are things that like i've started but i'll come back to later

**01:24:02** But I want to leave the 50 tabs that are open like I want to save those

**01:24:07** I would like to like visually distinguish times where it's like here are the two active projects

**01:24:12** And here's all of the other stuff that just like exists in some stage of incompleteness

**01:24:18** So I don't know if i'll be able to do that with profiles or not

**01:24:20** But I mean you could I don't know if you'll like the result, but it is a way to put your group somewhere

**01:24:25** Yeah, again, like the devil's always in the details of how these things work

**01:24:28** But if there is some way I can hide the ones that are inactive

**01:24:33** I would like to do that

**01:24:34** It's like, you know because i've just got some weird names that I look at all the time where it's like, oh, yeah

**01:24:38** Project jelly like 50 tabs on a topic. It's like, oh right

**01:24:42** But that one's not going to be done for like a year if ever

**01:24:45** Or like oh project blue. I don't even remember what project blue is and then I click on it

**01:24:50** It's like ah, right. There we go. A hundred tabs on a thing that

**01:24:55** Mentally planning it out will be like two years from now if that project is finished

**01:25:00** So it's like I don't want to have to look at that all the time for a thing

**01:25:03** That's like a really far way away. Have you ever shared a tab group with someone?

**01:25:07** No, why would I do that? Well because you have like

**01:25:10** People that help you out with the research. I just wondered if maybe

**01:25:14** It went that far the way i'm using tabs. It's just like there's no reason to share it with someone because what i'm constantly doing is

**01:25:21** You're growing the branches and then you're pruning the branches and you grow them again and prune them again. So it's like

**01:25:26** Exploration and then I work from the end backward of like, okay close all the unnecessary things new phase of exploration close all the unnecessary things

**01:25:35** and ultimately then I try to do little loops where

**01:25:38** I'll try to go through

**01:25:40** Backwards all of the tab groups and basically get them into obsidian like what's the useful information on here get it into obsidian

**01:25:47** Because you don't actually want it to live in this tab group

**01:25:49** But the exploration phase can be really big and quite far reaching

**01:25:54** Before it all gets condensed down. So

**01:25:56** For the current project there's 128 open tabs that are getting

**01:26:02** coalesced down into the project

**01:26:04** It's actually not the next project. That's the project after the next one. But yes, that's uh, naturally

**01:26:10** The current project actually has zero tabs. Okay, it's in animation, right? It's getting done the september video

**01:26:16** Oh that makes sense though. The research is done, right? Actually that video didn't have research which is delightful

**01:26:21** What a delight that was but yeah

**01:26:23** So the thing that'll probably be for if i'm being realistic about it the thing that's probably for november

**01:26:28** It currently exists as 128 tabs on my browser

**01:26:33** This episode of cortex is brought to you by flow state sessions the three-month productivity program that minimizes distractions and helps you get things done

**01:26:41** We talk about productivity on this show a lot

**01:26:45** And if you're someone who like me gets tons of emails too many slack notifications and task reminders all day

**01:26:51** You know what it's like to have your attention split you get that feeling that you're busy all the time

**01:26:56** But then when you look at your goals and what you want to achieve you feel like you haven't moved the needle

**01:27:01** This isn't your fault. It's not my fault. This is because of constantly managing distractions

**01:27:06** Do you ever wonder what those distractions could be costing you though?

**01:27:09** Do you ever wonder what that highly focused version of you could actually get done?

**01:27:13** Maybe you deal with your overflowing inbox make progress on that writing project finish the code for your next big feature

**01:27:20** Or maybe just be more efficient at your work and get some time back for yourself in the evening

**01:27:25** This is where flow state sessions come in the online co-working program to give you accountability for your tasks

**01:27:32** So you can become that distraction free version of yourself. They host calls based on something called the body doubling principle

**01:27:38** This is the idea that you're way more likely to be productive if you're in the virtual presence of other people

**01:27:44** The flow state sessions program includes three months of high focus sessions calls that turn down the dial of distraction

**01:27:51** To let you get your best work done. There are three flow state sessions every week to suit different time zones

**01:27:57** You just join the call of a task in mind and share your goal for the session with everybody else

**01:28:02** Then you mute your mic and get your work done

**01:28:04** Then when time's up everybody does a check-in so you can all be held accountable for the work that you said you do

**01:28:09** You get access to a progress tracker

**01:28:11** So you can track the sessions that you attend the goals you hit

**01:28:14** And get a bunch of really cool graphs that show your productivity stats over time who doesn't love a good graph

**01:28:20** Plus you'll get access to the flow state session slack with other like-minded people who are all striving to work more effectively

**01:28:27** You can use these sessions for whatever you like whether it's your daily works and professional development

**01:28:32** They could even be your very own personal writing retreat or grecation

**01:28:36** You probably heard me mention kerry on the show a bunch before she is relay fm's chief advertising officer and marketing strategist at cortex brand

**01:28:44** Well, kerry is also the founder and host of flow state sessions someone so busy

**01:28:49** You know that they must be productive

**01:29:58** Our thanks to flow state sessions for their support of this show and relay fm

**01:30:03** There's a question in our document here

**01:30:07** So we have a running list of these questions that people submit at cortexfeedback.com

**01:30:13** This one has been in here for quite a while. I think it just like moves around a bunch

**01:30:18** And I think today you may have moved it up a little bit

**01:30:22** The question is from ben who asks

**01:30:25** How do you deal with the fear?

**01:30:28** And this question

**01:30:31** Has always intrigued me. I think the way that it probably intrigues you too of like

**01:30:36** What does it even really mean? That's all ben gave. Yeah, there's no context or anything no context

**01:30:42** And so I guess this is one of those things you've got to take from it

**01:30:46** What you're putting into it and my assumption is we probably are coming at this from the same place of like

**01:30:52** The fear of it all going away. Yeah, I don't know. I just I found this question kind of

**01:30:58** Intriguing this time. Yeah, I think partly it caught my attention because

**01:31:04** Like I said at the start I find myself extremely stressed leading into the final months of the year, right?

**01:31:09** It's like we're in stack september and that is when it gets serious

**01:31:13** Yeah, I had someone say to me the other day when I was like talking through like oh man

**01:31:17** I gotta do all these things and like it's really high stakes

**01:31:20** They said to me like well, you know

**01:31:23** September is the beginning of winter and winter is the end of the year. So the year is almost over

**01:31:28** I was like no. No don't say that

**01:31:31** That doesn't help right compressing the time frame, but now I can't get that out of my head

**01:31:36** so I think it sort of caught my attention because

**01:31:39** That's kind of been on my mind

**01:31:40** but it also just like it has lived here as just an intriguing question like how do you deal with the fear and

**01:31:47** That can apply to a lot of things

**01:31:51** But it already sounds like you're taking this in a very different way that i'm taking this

**01:31:54** Yeah, I think I am. I want to know what you're thinking about and then we can talk about what i'm thinking about. So

**01:32:02** Trying to take this question at its most high level

**01:32:06** I think a lot of questions around fear

**01:32:11** in the modern world

**01:32:14** are

**01:32:15** questions around uncertainty about the future

**01:32:18** We know you're not afraid of being eaten by a tiger where it's like I have a very clear image of what that is

**01:32:25** I think that's just not the sort of fear or stress that people deal with mostly in modernity

**01:32:30** I think people are dealing with stuff that is around uncertainty

**01:32:34** Like as a good example

**01:32:36** We talked at the end of the year and have still kind of yet to revisit the topic although we sort of did today

**01:32:42** about oh no AI has burst onto the scene all of a sudden like what does this mean?

**01:32:49** Yeah at some point we should get back to this and I'm actually this is the great thing about the cortex podcast content calendar

**01:32:57** I'm just going to put this in there as a thing that like at some point

**01:33:00** I think we should talk about AI again because it has been a year

**01:33:03** Yeah, and a lot has changed and it's only really made passing phrase

**01:33:07** I have found it kind of interesting actually how we haven't discussed it

**01:33:10** But yeah, so we should like throw that into the future

**01:33:12** but I think like that's a good example of like a thing comes up and there can totally be a

**01:33:18** What does this mean? Right? Like I have no idea

**01:33:23** as

**01:33:24** content creators

**01:33:26** There's always like this uncertainty about the things that you make and how they're going to be received

**01:33:31** I also feel like this caught my attention because i'm really aware of the video that's going to go up this month

**01:33:39** The one that's going to go up in september

**01:33:42** Definitely has the feeling to me of

**01:33:45** This video could really whiff like this one could really miss

**01:33:49** I think it has like quite a high variance in outcomes

**01:33:54** I could see this just not working at all. That's just very bad. It like makes you feel

**01:34:00** Uncomfortable, especially because this is one that's just going to be really complicated

**01:34:04** Like it's taken a long time to do and is a big thing

**01:34:08** And if it misses it's just very bad if that happens

**01:34:11** But again, like I view that as a kind of

**01:34:14** fear of

**01:34:16** Uncertainty, you don't know

**01:34:18** What is going to happen and it's like oh

**01:34:21** it's

**01:34:22** Embarrassing if you make something that's like earnest and it just does poorly and you go. Oh, right. That's bad

**01:34:30** It's uncertain about like what is the future of your work look like if a tool comes around all of a sudden that like might impact

**01:34:37** that in a direct way

**01:34:40** And on the very small scale, it's just like oh there's a lot of uncertainty about

**01:34:46** How much of what I need to do can I get done in the next few months and I think

**01:34:54** For me the thing that unites all of this stuff is

**01:34:58** Two things it's like one

**01:35:00** You have to sort of notice in the first place that you're feeling this uncertainty about the future

**01:35:07** It can be sometimes trickier to notice that than you think

**01:35:10** Again, it can get kind of muddled up in other feelings like I am stressed

**01:35:15** But you don't necessarily recognize like oh

**01:35:18** I am uncertain about something like that's the more precise thing that's going on here

**01:35:23** and

**01:35:24** For me. Anyway, the biggest thing that always helps with this is just

**01:35:30** slowing down and

**01:35:32** writing things down particularly on physical paper to look at and to try to

**01:35:40** Think about the situation over the years i've discussed doing various different versions of this

**01:35:46** But this was another thing that I did on my most recent vacation was just

**01:35:52** I just had a pen and I was writing things down and like tearing out pages and

**01:35:58** Rearranging them and looking at them and thinking about like, okay. Here are the different things that I need to do

**01:36:04** It is part of the reasons why i've always been a big advocate of

**01:36:08** Actual paper even though like so much of my life is digital and it is that like slowing down. It's that

**01:36:14** deliberateness

**01:36:16** and so

**01:36:18** Over a couple of days. I eventually like made a little

**01:36:21** Document that I was writing that I just called like the plan

**01:36:25** and sort of outlined

**01:36:28** the critical things over the next couple of months and made notes on

**01:36:33** again trying to reduce uncertainty of

**01:36:36** If you're running behind which of these things is the first thing to go

**01:36:42** What is the point at which you need to make a decision about if this is going to happen or if that is going to happen?

**01:36:49** and

**01:36:50** That kind of thing to me is the best tool in the modern world for

**01:36:56** kind of getting rid of the fear is

**01:36:59** do your best to reduce uncertainty

**01:37:04** And practically that often means

**01:37:07** Use a slow tool like writing on paper

**01:37:11** to

**01:37:13** deliberately think through the details of whatever it is you're dealing with because

**01:37:20** Facing the details

**01:37:22** Is much better than having this just

**01:37:26** Vague thing in the back of your mind that you are not dealing with

**01:37:31** How do you deal with the fear mike typically i'm fine like

**01:37:36** Typically, I don't have it. You're fearless. Is that what you're saying?

**01:37:39** No, I mean what i'm thinking about with the fear is like the fear that this is all going to go away, right?

**01:37:44** And by this you mean what my entire career right?

**01:37:47** I'm gonna lose it all or i'm gonna lose enough of it that I can't do it anymore, you know, like

**01:37:52** lose enough of

**01:37:54** The way that I make my living

**01:37:57** And I need to find a new living, right?

**01:37:59** Mm-hmm

**01:38:00** Because if I can't support my family, I can't keep doing this. I have to get a job

**01:38:05** and

**01:38:06** usually it's fine because I kind of like

**01:38:10** Use the past as a way to inform the future in this regard of like whatever comes up

**01:38:16** Whatever hassle I may have whenever warrior may have stress concern

**01:38:20** I look at my past and i'm like well, I made it through all of these things over the last 10 years

**01:38:26** I'm sure I will be able to continue doing that and like that's what gets me through most of the time

**01:38:31** And I believe in myself as a you know, the ability to be able to adapt and change and we've done enough of that over time

**01:38:38** but

**01:38:39** This is an interesting time to ask me this question because

**01:38:44** I am feeling the fear at the moment more than I have it a while

**01:38:48** And I think it's because of stacked september

**01:38:51** Mm-hmm

**01:38:53** so I was thinking about this a little bit

**01:38:57** and I kind of imagine

**01:39:00** We're going metaphorical here. All right, so imagine we've got like a jar, right?

**01:39:05** and

**01:39:06** at the very top of this jar is

**01:39:09** fear

**01:39:11** And I need enough of a water level

**01:39:14** To rise to the very top of this jar to hit the fear

**01:39:18** and that water level is just

**01:39:21** Stress so like stress is the liquid and the more stress that I have

**01:39:26** the closer I am to hitting that point where i'm now just gonna

**01:39:31** Start treating everything like it's the end like kind of catastrophizing, right?

**01:39:36** The more stressed I am the more likely I am to catastrophize

**01:39:40** This is something that i'm living in right now a little bit more than normal where any

**01:39:44** Bad thing that happens is kind of like well, that's that's it then

**01:39:48** and this is because I am

**01:39:51** more than usual at a kind of

**01:39:54** Whits end kind of feeling, you know, like

**01:39:57** I've been talking about this over the last few weeks, right? Like we've just got enough going on

**01:40:02** All at the same time in all of my various endeavors that all feel really important

**01:40:08** and so that puts a pressure on me where i'm like

**01:40:13** This is all hard, but what if it all went away?

**01:40:17** I don't really know why this is happening

**01:40:19** Like there are certain pressures that I always have and like they're usually fine

**01:40:25** But I think i've just got a few things just hitting at the same time

**01:40:29** And that mixture of stuff is now making me like worried that the whole thing's gonna gonna crumble to pieces

**01:40:36** So this is just like a really interesting time to ask me this question because I think I have this

**01:40:41** Stress on me right now more than I not even normally do like more than I can remember in a while. Maybe like

**01:40:49** The last time I felt like this was like

**01:40:53** April 2020

**01:40:55** Right, like that was maybe the last time I felt like oh at any minute this

**01:40:59** This whole thing could come crumbling down

**01:41:01** The complicated thing is it was really easy to point to what it was then it'd be like well, obviously right everyone felt felt like that

**01:41:07** But it's harder for me to yeah, exactly. It's harder for me to do that right now

**01:41:11** It's just like what because i've got like a bunch of stuff going on for some reason i'm now like

**01:41:16** Just assuming that the whole thing's gonna fall down. I mean, yeah, I guess welcome to my brain

**01:41:21** Like I don't really have much of a an answer for it

**01:41:25** One of the things that i've been doing recently at the request of my therapist is gratitude journaling

**01:41:31** So i've added that into my theme system journal

**01:41:33** So the big box in the middle where I usually write down what i'm thinking is now gratitude

**01:41:37** So i'm doing that and then and I know that you do it and I know that it helps you

**01:41:41** So i'm adding that in it's just like a I don't know like I think it's more of a

**01:41:47** Pressure release valve of like, all right, you're stressed. You've got a bunch of stuff going on. But what's the good stuff?

**01:41:51** What are you happy about? And that is nice. Like I do enjoy that as an activity every day

**01:41:57** But I know that I will feel better

**01:42:00** Once this year draws more towards a close

**01:42:05** Before we go today. I want to let the cortexans know that on saturday september 22nd from 12 p.m

**01:42:12** To 12 a.m. U.S. Eastern time. Yes 12 hours at twitch.tv slash relay FM

**01:42:18** You will be able to tune in to watch the podcastathon for saint jude

**01:42:23** We're going to be at the saint jude campus and we're going to be streaming for 12 hours this year

**01:42:29** We have a variety of games challenges and activities

**01:42:32** The theme for the podcastathon this year is mike versus steven

**01:42:36** So the co-founders are going at it and we're gonna crown the champion at the end of it

**01:42:40** I love your mike versus steven art by the way. It's so charming

**01:42:44** That's the desk mat art that for people that sign up to fundraise themselves

**01:42:49** They can earn a desk mat that we've made and this artwork is going to be making its way into lots of things in the podcastathon

**01:42:56** We have our first in studio guests

**01:42:58** We have Jason and kathy who both hosts at relay FM are going to be like our

**01:43:04** Adjudicators and they're going to be helping score some games and getting involved in some of the games that me and steven will be competing

**01:43:09** Against of each other from our production standpoint. This is going to be

**01:43:14** the biggest and best

**01:43:16** Podcastathon like we have a set designer this year. We have three sets in the studio

**01:43:22** I cannot believe how this grows every year. I'm very excited about it to be honest

**01:43:28** I cannot wait. I love doing the podcastathon. It is a great day. I'm full of nervous anticipation for 12 hours

**01:43:35** Like I think it will be fine

**01:43:37** But we'll find out

**01:43:39** Because we've done like 10 and it was it doesn't really feel any different to eight

**01:43:45** But I don't know we're also being more physical than we would normally be so okay

**01:43:50** I don't know how that's going to change things. Maybe I'll get to hour six and we'll need a little nap

**01:43:54** I don't know. We'll find out that's gonna make it harder. Yes. That's there's not a mystery if it's gonna be more physical

**01:43:59** It's gonna be harder. Mike. It's gonna be great

**01:44:01** I can't wait and I expect by our 10 me and steven will just be out of our minds
