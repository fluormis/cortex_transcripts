# Cortex - 153: What Even Is an Office?
**00:00:00** Do you know, it feels like it has been so long since we recorded Lust.

**00:00:05** Like, really long.

**00:00:07** Where I actually can't believe it's only been like a month.

**00:00:10** That's not true.

**00:00:11** Is it only a... wait.

**00:00:13** It's a month and ten days, I think.

**00:00:16** Okay. I am dealing with two contradictory feelings.

**00:00:22** My mental model of time is somehow that the current year has not yet started,

**00:00:29** but also we have not spoken for like six months.

**00:00:33** I feel like I have lived a whole life in America since the last time we spoke.

**00:00:40** Yeah, you were gone for a long time.

**00:00:41** Like, last year was year of work and your theme is going great,

**00:00:46** but it's often there are seasons in life.

**00:00:48** Seasons are very important and it has definitely been that this first season of the year has

**00:00:55** very forcefully become the season of family and taken over life in a whole bunch of different ways.

**00:01:02** That's partly why I ended up just spending a ridiculously long time in America

**00:01:06** and also feel like, oh, the year hasn't started yet because I've had all of these other obligations and things.

**00:01:13** But yes, it's like I cannot believe that we talked, quote, as recently as a month ago

**00:01:19** because it feels like, yeah, so much has happened.

**00:01:24** OK, this might sound crazy to you. I'm just realizing something partly because there was a way,

**00:01:28** partly because I'm dealing with family stuff.

**00:01:31** It suddenly just dawned on me that you are the first person I am going to hear talk about using the Apple headset

**00:01:44** who was not a member of my family.

**00:01:47** I've been so busy slash isolated that I have not listened to any podcasts.

**00:01:54** I've not seen any YouTube videos. I'm suddenly realizing like I've actually had no external input.

**00:02:02** What a bizarre start to the year.

**00:02:04** Well, I mean, I will say that that makes us talking about this infinitely more interesting to me because you're a pure.

**00:02:12** That's right, Mike. I am pure.

**00:02:14** A little baby chicken, you know, no, Mike, pure like clean, pure, like holy and untouched. That's what I am.

**00:02:22** Yeah, that's what I'm saying. Yeah. We're all agree. We're all agree.

**00:02:25** I just hadn't really put that into precise thoughts because I've also just had this experience of really feeling like,

**00:02:32** again, another strange duality of I haven't been able to have any kind of normal working life at all because of other things.

**00:02:41** So I haven't been able to even really begin to see where the headset will fit into what is like a normal life, a normal working life.

**00:02:51** While at the same time, I feel like I have these massive, big re-thinkings of everything that have to happen that I just like I haven't been able to properly process or digest,

**00:03:05** which I could only try to compress down into a thought, which is something like what even is an office?

**00:03:15** I think I want to hear like what have you been up to as a person with a much more, I presume, regular day to day experience since we last talked like how have things been going for you?

**00:03:30** So the main thing that I've settled on is that my vision Pro stays at the studio. I don't bring it home.

**00:03:38** The main reason I don't do that is because it's just it's too much to commute with. Like, I don't want to commute with that every day.

**00:03:47** It's big and heavy, especially in the Apple case. And plus, it is a fragile piece of technology.

**00:03:54** It feels like it has a lot of ways in which it could break. And so like, I'm not interested in moving it backwards and forwards.

**00:04:01** But also, you know, after about a week of use, I kind of realized that realistically, the times in which I would want to use it during the day are when I'm here at the studio.

**00:04:13** Like, I'm less likely to want to use it in the evening when I'm spending time with my wife. Like, then there is kind of like that line of like, it is not a social device.

**00:04:25** It is not a device in which you can remain social in the conventions that we have today. I do believe these conventions will change in some way.

**00:04:37** The reason I say that is like, just think about how phones fit into social norms now, where that would have been considered to be weird prior to the smartphone becoming so prevalent.

**00:04:51** The idea that you could be talking to someone while looking at something else inherently feels rude. I mean, if you look at a watch during a conversation that's considered rude, right?

**00:05:00** I was going to say, I do feel like both of these are still quite rude, but I know what you're getting at.

**00:05:05** I know what you mean, but people just accept it and it's how people live their lives a lot of times. But the face computer does not fit into these norms yet.

**00:05:16** But just for me, like the things that I want to do in the evening, it doesn't fit that. So it makes sense more for me to have it at the studio.

**00:05:25** And so then when I'm here at the studio, we're coming back to the age old question of like what computer is right for the job, whatever that job might be.

**00:05:34** And so for me, where I'm finding the biggest parallel with the Vision Pro is to the iPad in that regard, right?

**00:05:42** Where does an iPad fit into whatever tasks I might be doing and thinking it through those lenses of like, I'm not just going to force the Vision Pro into my work.

**00:05:54** I don't wear it when I record podcasts because there's no point.

**00:05:56** Oh, you're not wearing it right now. I didn't want to ask.

**00:05:59** I've tried it once and didn't like it. I tried it just for the novelty of it and it didn't feel very good.

**00:06:05** The way I've been describing the Vision Pro for me, it is like the ultimate noodling computer.

**00:06:10** That sounds terrible.

**00:06:11** Yes, I love it though. It's the noodling computer.

**00:06:13** I feel like you've just gotten my clean robes dirty with your noodles.

**00:06:17** The pure boy cannot take noodling.

**00:06:20** So what I mean by this is I feel like there is an element of computer usage where you're kind of just bouncing around from app to app from thing to thing.

**00:06:33** I consider this is kind of like noodling around.

**00:06:36** You're just like, I'm over here.

**00:06:38** I hope there's an email. I'll look at that.

**00:06:40** What's going on in Slack?

**00:06:41** Let me go take a look at my YouTube subscriptions.

**00:06:44** What's happening here? What's happening there?

**00:06:46** If you don't actually have a focus purpose for the work that you're doing or what you're doing on your computer at that time,

**00:06:52** you're just kind of like noodling around.

**00:06:55** And I feel like the Vision Pro is so good for this because most of the apps that I would need are there in some form for this kind of stuff.

**00:07:05** And it crushes the iPad window management because you can have all the windows open that you want.

**00:07:15** Now, it takes setting up, but the iPad, I can only really look at a couple of apps at a time and it be comfortable.

**00:07:23** I've never really gotten to grips, a stage manager on an iPad, but even that, it just it's not what I want.

**00:07:29** And so like what I like with the vision Pro is I can open this app.

**00:07:31** I can open this app. I could open that app and I can spread them all over my physical space.

**00:07:35** And I can like just be like looking up here, looking over there, doing this, doing that.

**00:07:40** And I find this to be something that pretty much every day I get to a point in my work day,

**00:07:46** which is usually in between two large things.

**00:07:48** So it might be like preparing for a show and recording a show.

**00:07:51** And I'll have like an hour, an hour and a half.

**00:07:53** It's like that is perfect vision pro time.

**00:07:55** Put the vision pro on. Oh, I've got this like message.

**00:07:58** Let me look at that. I've got this. Let me look at that.

**00:08:00** Let me just chill out and watch a YouTube video.

**00:08:02** I need to do a bit of prep in this way.

**00:08:04** Like it has become a very nice machine for just bouncing around from thing to thing.

**00:08:09** That is where I'm finding the best use cases for me right now.

**00:08:13** I can't even like hear you talk about this.

**00:08:17** I can tell you're in physical pain right now.

**00:08:19** What is the matter? I am like cringing over here because I feel like, look, I don't know a lot about the vision pro.

**00:08:25** I haven't used the vision pro as much as you have, but I have used it.

**00:08:30** I've used it in very particular ways.

**00:08:33** And I had the experience of like setting it up and trying out different apps.

**00:08:39** And there was something to me that was very quickly with like disgusting about certain kinds of things.

**00:08:47** And I think it is because like the most concentrated version of my thoughts on the vision pro is that this is a machine to work with the creative core of your soul.

**00:09:05** It's like you're stepping into a temple of unbroken focus and to check your slack or reply to email messages in here is desecration.

**00:09:18** I feel like I'm listening to blasphemy.

**00:09:21** Well, okay. I'm not really sure why you're turning this in such a religious experience, but like I do agree with you.

**00:09:28** And so like what I like is I feel like compared to other computers, it has much more of a potential to mode shift in this way because I've also like I had to write content for an email newsletter.

**00:09:42** Right. And I was sitting on my Mac and I was struggling to get it done because I was just getting distracted.

**00:09:48** So I went sat on the couch, put the vision pro on, got a magic keyboard, went into Haleakala and wrote and got it done.

**00:09:56** And like that mode shifting helped me a lot. So I use it for what you do.

**00:10:01** But the thing to remember is like my major like creative work.

**00:10:06** It's just not good for that. That is fair. That is fair.

**00:10:08** When I am doing things that require like an extended focus, like sitting down and writing something for half an hour, the vision pro is better than any other computer I use for those kinds of things because you can kind of put yourself somewhere else and like, all right, I'm here now.

**00:10:25** So I've got to get this done. But if I'm finding like where it fits into my day to day, the idea of just like throwing up a bunch of windows and just bouncing around and doing some little admin tasks and stuff, it's fantastic for that too.

**00:10:39** But I don't read and read and read and write thousands of words like as part of my creative work life.

**00:10:47** So while I agree, it's great for that. I can't like force that because it doesn't exist most of the time.

**00:10:53** Okay, so there's a real question of window management that is underlaying all of this.

**00:11:00** Like last time when we spoke, one of the things that I was just so aware of is the lack of command tab on the keyboard where you're like you're moving apps around this way.

**00:11:11** And one of the things that's brought into focus for me is like is a very particular way that I use the computer. It's actually something that I've been kind of thinking a little bit about doing like, you know, maybe like an unlisted video about or something for just like, how do I manage the windows on my computer?

**00:11:30** Because I feel like I have a really good system for this of moving things around. And it's one of these ways in which like lots of times, you know, you'll hear people say things like, oh, it's so great to have a second window for your computer.

**00:11:43** And it's one of these things that I have tried that multiple times over the years. You mean like a second display? Yeah, like sorry. Yeah, like a second display. Windows is terrible word to use for that. A window onto the windows. That's what a display is.

**00:11:55** A second window for your windows machine. I've tried it and I've tried it and it's like it never sticks. And the reason that it never sticks, I always kind of felt like it's some kind of personal failing it away.

**00:12:11** I was like, oh, everybody who uses two monitors talks about how great it is. And I can just never make this work for me. It must be something wrong with me. But the headset has really clarified for me what the actual problem is, which is,

**00:12:25** I don't want to look around for anything. It's really clarified to me that like when I am really in a flow on my computer and working,

**00:12:36** one of the critical things for that is like through the keyboard and without ever having to move my head physically side to side, like I can always put the windows exactly where I want them to be. Even if I'm working on multiple things.

**00:12:51** Yeah, this is definitely something where me and you differ because I feel like in the Vision Pro, I feel like a different level of productive.

**00:13:00** Like it's the Iron Man, Tony Stark kind of thing where I like I'm looking over here, I'm looking over there, I'm dragging this, I'm grabbing that. Like I feel like I'm more part of the process.

**00:13:12** I'm in the machine in a way and like it being around me visually and me looking around and like that idea of the spatialness where like in my brain, it's like I know now where messages goes because like I always put it in a specific spot.

**00:13:28** So if I wanted to send a message, I would go and look at the bottom right and like I would actually turn my head to do that. Like I like that. I do think that right now, thankfully, the Vision Pro is quite adaptable in that way.

**00:13:40** That like I can use it for noodling and you can use it for like purity and like and it's okay, I think like it's doing the job.

**00:13:49** So I'm going to say a thing which I'll preface by like I think this will sound insulting, but I don't mean it to. I just don't know. I don't have a better way to express this idea.

**00:13:57** And I saw this particularly with my dad as well is I think the thing is that the headset has a surprising normie computer user bias in a weird way.

**00:14:10** Like I think there is a way in which if you are like a very high level power user, the headset can feel like a constraining environment because it's based on the iPad.

**00:14:21** Yeah, but that's like it's surprising to me in a way because like, oh, this is the most high tech thing, but the way it wants to be used is in such a normal way.

**00:14:33** It is very funny to be like, I think my father used my headset more than I used it when I was in America because he was like, hey, can I have that again? And it's like, what was he doing? It's like, boy, he learned how to get to the movie theater real fast.

**00:14:46** And it was like the first time he was like, hey, can I borrow your headset? I almost dropped dead of surprise. I just would never have predicted that in a thousand years.

**00:14:56** And the thing about like you with window management is I think like if someone was watching the two of us working on our regular computers, they would describe like, oh, Grey is using it in this weird way where it's like he never wants to have to touch the mouse and he doesn't want to have to move.

**00:15:13** And Mike is like, oh, a normal relaxed person just like using a computer like a person should like that's the distinction there. And so that's what I mean by like, I think there's a surprising normie bias. Like, do you want to watch a movie? It's amazing.

**00:15:28** Do you want to spread things around you like you would in the physical worlds? Great. This is absolutely perfect for it.

**00:15:36** You see, I understand where you're coming from, but I will pull you up on the idea like multiple monitors is a normie thing that feels like a power user thing to me.

**00:15:45** No, no, but I'm saying like that always failed to me because I didn't recognize like I don't want to look around. Yeah. So there's some kind of like intersection here like that's not working for me.

**00:15:54** And the reason most normal people don't have multiple monitors is because it's a giant pain in the ass to have multiple monitors. Like it's just not worth it for most people to bother.

**00:16:03** But the headset is like, oh, if you could just like magically have big windows all around your office, like people would do that. They would like decorate their office, you know, virtually in this way with using things.

**00:16:14** I think it is very interesting, but it has created for me this weird situation that I think like the first time I used it this way, it was just so clear that the very fact that I find it frustrating to have to look around even when I'm using my regular computer.

**00:16:32** But especially in the in this virtual environment that like I don't want to look around for anything. I find it really frustrating actually turns this into just the most perfect concentration machine.

**00:16:47** I can put a window in front of me and that is it. Switching into anything else is really hard. And also the whole external world no longer exists functionally when you turn the environment up all the way.

**00:17:04** And for me, the times I have used it for writing, I can only describe it as like intensely dreamlike. It's like way more draining when a work session is over than normal because I can just feel that that concentration dial has been turned up to just the maximum that it can be.

**00:17:28** You know, I've always talked for years about like, oh, the environment around you is really important and you need to arrange that in like a way to be conducive to work. So in some sense, this is not surprising, but it has been a real visceral experience of what is the maximum possible version of this.

**00:17:46** The maximum possible version of this is like blowing away everything that is really around you and being locked into only able to look at one thing. It almost feels like this is the thing that I didn't know I have been trying to achieve for this core of my working environment.

**00:18:08** Well, that's very good. I want to fuck on a bit of roller coaster ride with you there because I couldn't really tell where you were going to end. But that's also why I think like I didn't mean to, but I was literally cringing over here when you're like, I opened up slack and I'm like, ah, I just.

**00:18:26** I'm having a good time of it and I'm just struck by the idea of like, and I'm not losing sight of it. This is the 1.0 years, 1.0. This is so early and we're three months away from seeing what vision OS two is. I assume that's going to be really interesting.

**00:18:44** Like I'm very keen to see do they just fix bugs and problems or do they push it? I'm very keen to see what that might mean. Of course, WWDC this year is going to be the AI WWDC. How will that play into the vision Pro is going to be very intriguing.

**00:19:04** Like I feel like I've had an exciting time so far and now just as soon as I'm going to start getting used to it, then it could change some. I feel like it is a good point for something like this. What do you mean? It's a good point for something like this as a technology entertainer.

**00:19:22** It is an interesting moment right now. Okay. Yeah. I mean, look, is it perfect? Absolutely not. Like I have problems quite frequently with eye tracking. Like it's just like, I can't get it to do what I want it to do. But when I'm using it, I'm like, yeah, okay. That is a 1.0. Like that is a first version of this thing. In theory, they should be able to make it better. You know, even on 1.1, my personas mouth doesn't move. Oh, you still have no mouth in the screen. Yeah, they made them look better.

**00:19:50** And the personas do look better, but my mouth and my soul does not move. I have had it confirmed. I don't know if I did last time we spoke that it's mustaches are the problem. And so I guess they're gonna have to work around that because I'm not going to shave my mustache. So my personas mouth moves. I have had more FaceTime calls with the personas and I am finding that to be a very, very good experience. What do you mean? On the receiving end or on the sending end or both? Well, me as the person receiving the call, I find it to be very good. Okay.

**00:20:19** I can't speak to the other person. I think actually people having persona calls of me get a worse experience because they are talking to someone whose mouth is so shut. I find it to be pretty similar to the experience of the calls that we were having with the Quest Pro. And that is just because of the fidelity of what Apple has built. Like the persona looks like the person you know. And you can very quickly trick yourself into like that's possible.

**00:20:48** Like it doesn't take very long and it's enhanced by the spatial audio. So like the little persona call the person is in a box, right? But wherever you move the box is where the audio comes from. So if I'm looking at something and I had a call with Jason last night, I put Jason to the right. He's mostly into my right ear and something that blew my mind yesterday. So you've been in mega studio.

**00:21:17** It is a larger room. It has a bit of echo in it in some spots, right? I'm talking to Jason. There is echo on his voice. Oh, like Apple does work in understanding the room tone of the room that you are in. Really? Are you sure they're doing this? You know how I know because we put it in an environment. No more echo. Wow. Yeah, it blew my mind. It's like there is no need for you to do this.

**00:21:37** But I love it because it made him feel more like he was in the room with me because when I would speak, I would hear my voice reverberate and when he would speak his voice reverberates. That is some interesting attention to detail. I would never have thought of that. But it's stuff like that, which like elevates that experience. It's like little things like this where it's like, okay, I'm gonna have to do this. I'm gonna have to do this.

**00:21:55** I'm gonna have to do this. I'm gonna have to do this. I'm gonna have to do this. I'm gonna have to do this. I'm gonna have to do this. I'm gonna have to do this. I'm gonna have to do this. I'm gonna have to do this. I'm gonna have to do this. I'm gonna have to do this. I'm gonna have to do this. I'm gonna have to do this. I'm gonna have to do this. I'm gonna have to do this. I'm gonna have to do this. I'm gonna have to do this. I'm gonna have to do this. I'm gonna have to do this. I'm gonna have to do this. I'm gonna have to do this. I'm gonna have to do this. I'm gonna have to do this. I'm gonna have to do this. I'm gonna have to do this. I'm gonna have to do this. I'm gonna have to do this. I'm gonna have to do this. I'm gonna have to do this

**00:22:25** because I'm gonna have to do this. I'm gonna have to do this. I'm gonna have to do this.

**00:22:55** I'm gonna have to do this. I'm gonna have to do this. I'm gonna have to do this. I'm

**00:23:15** gonna have to do this. I'm gonna have to do this. I'm gonna have to do this because I'm

**00:23:20** gonna have to do this because I'm gonna have to do this. I'm gonna have to do this. You

**00:23:26** know what? I'm gonna have to do this. I'm gonna have to do this. I'm gonna have to do

**00:23:32** this because I'm gonna have to do this. So I'm gonna have to do this. It's beautiful.

**00:23:38** Last cool day, I just wanted to make sure that I was kind of going with everything.

**00:23:45** the fact that you could not use a Dvorak keyboard with your Vision Pro. Frank let us know if you

**00:23:50** go to Settings, General Keyboards, Hardware Keyboard, English. English. So it's the language

**00:23:55** and then you can scroll down to Dvorak so you can have an external keyboard set to different layouts

**00:24:01** but it's in the language preferences. Yeah, I was really happy to know that. I would never have found

**00:24:06** it there. It's someplace different everywhere else, like we were saying last time. The settings is

**00:24:10** very strange because it tricks you into thinking you know where things are but you don't have any

**00:24:13** idea everything is weird. The settings app on the Vision Pro is the place where the uncanny valley

**00:24:18** exists. Yes, yes, you know what you're right that is actually where the uncanny valley is, is the

**00:24:23** settings app. This looks like the settings that I know but nothing's in the places where that usually

**00:24:29** is even though it's labeled the same. It's very strange in there. Even just dumb things I find

**00:24:34** myself having to scroll down further because I'm like well surely that would be up near the top.

**00:24:38** It's like no not here, here it's at the bottom. So again thanks Frank for pointing that out

**00:24:42** because that made a wild difference along with basically it was that plus.

**00:24:49** Mike's suggestion that I should switch over my obsidian to obsidian sync and use the iPad version

**00:24:59** and not do the screen sharing thing and so it's like great I've got the obsidian with obsidian

**00:25:05** sync in the iPad mode and I'm also able to use an external keyboard with the headset. Honestly,

**00:25:11** those two things just fundamentally changed everything about the headset for me. Like that's

**00:25:15** how I found what this is for. Using Vision OS 1.1 and the newest version of Mac OS though the Mac

**00:25:22** display to my eyes is significantly clearer, more readable. That's interesting to know yeah I mean

**00:25:28** like that is the only way I can imagine doing some sort of work that is not like purely focused in

**00:25:37** this way. Yeah I think they've made some big improvements there like text is very readable

**00:25:42** now where it was like mostly readable before. It looks much more like I'm just looking at my

**00:25:47** computer display rather than looking at a screen share by computer display. I'll check that out

**00:25:51** because I want to see what it looks like but I do feel like this is such a valuable thing for me.

**00:25:55** I do want to like preserve the purity of this environment. Yeah of course. But it is like it

**00:26:02** is just so interesting like you said before about the headset being a kind of iPad. Like that really

**00:26:07** is the way to think about it is like the computer is the best general purpose machine but the iPad

**00:26:12** is better at some specific things and that is just the way to mentally frame the Vision Pro in the

**00:26:17** same way. I will just say if there's anybody listening who works on the keyboard stuff on

**00:26:22** the headset man that little text predictor keyboard thing and the actual keyboard in the

**00:26:29** headset I feel like they are driving me crazy. It's like I never want to see them go away. I'm

**00:26:35** so aware of I have to do this like such a dumb thing but when I click on Obsidian and I start

**00:26:40** typing the little text predictor thing is like hi hey I'm here to help you and I have to like

**00:26:45** move it behind me like it's such a strange thing like I can't get rid of it. So you just don't

**00:26:50** want to see the quick type bar. Yeah that's what it's called the quick type bar. Yeah it's like I

**00:26:55** never want to see you. I don't want your predictions. I am completely uninterested.

**00:27:01** You don't help me at all. The only thing you are is like a distracting second place where what I'm

**00:27:07** typing is showing up and then you're trying to pick the most predictable next word which when I'm

**00:27:14** writing is like literally antithetical to what I am trying to do. So yeah I never want to see it

**00:27:19** and I find it a strange and bizarre experience. Like to take that thing and like throw it over

**00:27:24** my head or like fling it behind me like it has to go somewhere otherwise it will keep reappearing.

**00:27:30** And it's like this is the strange thing about virtual environments. It does have a real

**00:27:35** physicality kind of feeling to it like go away annoying bug and it's like no I'm right back here.

**00:27:41** It's like all right like buzz behind me please just don't ever show back up like I never want

**00:27:47** that thing to appear. I mean look maybe I couldn't find it maybe if I go into optical ID there's a

**00:27:53** setting to turn off the text prediction. I have no idea but I was like unable to find anywhere to

**00:27:58** make this thing go away forever. I never want to see it again. This episode of Cortex is brought

**00:28:04** to you by FitBod. Everybody has their own fitness path. So FitBod is an app that makes sure that it

**00:28:11** uses the data that you give it to customize everything to suit you exactly. FitBod adapts

**00:28:16** as you improve making sure every workout remains challenging pushing you to make the progress that

**00:28:21** you want. Progress can be difficult. When you want to change your fitness level it can be hard to know

**00:28:27** where you get started. So that is why FitBod does everything they can to make both an easy

**00:28:33** and affordable way to build a fitness plan that is personalized for you. When it comes to fitness

**00:28:40** you're going to see great results when you have a workout program that is tailored to suit you.

**00:28:44** It suits your body, it suits your experience level, the environment that you're working out in and the

**00:28:48** goals that you have. FitBod takes all of that information and stores it inside of your FitBod

**00:28:53** gym profile. FitBod will track your muscle recovery making sure that you're avoiding burnout,

**00:28:58** you're avoiding overstressing your muscles and keeping up momentum. And it builds the best

**00:29:18** movements the right way thanks to their more than 1000 demonstration videos. I find this to be so

**00:29:24** important. FitBod app is really easy to use as I'm seeing what my workout is going to be,

**00:29:29** showing me each exercise. If I know what it is I can just go ahead and do it. In fact I can just

**00:29:33** see it on my Apple watch and I can tap through to see what my exercises are. But if they're

**00:29:37** introducing something new to me, which they do to make sure that I'm having a balanced workout,

**00:29:42** I can watch some videos to make sure I'm going to be performing it correctly.

**00:30:39** continued support of this show and Relay FM. I'll ask Cortex a question from Harris.

**00:30:46** Can you pace in a Vision Pro? Mike, have you tried that? I've walked around a bit on fine. I mean,

**00:30:52** I'm not a pacer, but yeah, I've moved around in my office while wearing it. The pass-through

**00:30:58** is so good. There's been lots of videos I've seen since of like people doing wild stuff like

**00:31:03** MQBHD played table tennis wearing it. Really? Because the latency is that good. Yeah, I mean,

**00:31:10** I find myself quite a lot like I wear it and it's like, oh, I want to go refill my water bottle.

**00:31:15** Like I could just go do that. Just stand up and go do that. I have yet to get over the fact of like

**00:31:20** turning around and seeing your apps, like where you left them. That is like such a strange

**00:31:25** thing still or walking through an app. It's not an experience that makes me feel very good. Like,

**00:31:31** I feel like a ghost. It's very strange. But I feel like if I was a pacer, I would have no problem

**00:31:38** pacing. But you tell me. This was like one of my top thoughts, because I'm really thinking about

**00:31:46** this even more so now in terms of like for great occasions where I pace for miles and miles every

**00:31:51** day. Like, is this the kind of thing that I can use the Vision headset for? And I was really excited

**00:31:57** to try it one morning. So I was up super duper early and setting things up. And the key thing

**00:32:04** for me here is if I'm pacing, right, I'm standing up. And normally when I do this, you have to like

**00:32:13** arrange the laptop screen to be at the right height and the keyboard at the right height. But now it's

**00:32:18** like, oh, great. I can just like make a pile of boxes and put the keyboard on top and that's fine.

**00:32:22** I can pace back and forth. And so set up obsidian. And it works. It's not perfect with text, because

**00:32:34** what you don't notice when you're normally walking around and windows are around you is that there

**00:32:39** is I don't know if it's the headset physically moving on your face when you take a step, but

**00:32:46** there is like a tiny bounce that I think is the kind of thing you only really notice when you're

**00:32:51** looking only at text very precisely. So there is like a tiny little judder for steps when you're

**00:33:00** looking at text, but it is totally within the acceptable bounds. And I did multiple little

**00:33:06** writing sessions where I was pacing back and forth and left obsidian. I did it two ways. First,

**00:33:14** left obsidian just on the blank wall in my dad's office as I was pacing back and forth in the real

**00:33:19** space. I actually decided like, I don't like that at all. I turned on the full environment. I was

**00:33:25** like, well, this doesn't work at all if you're pacing because you are popping on and off the

**00:33:29** moon or wherever you have set up. So the thing that actually worked surprisingly well is turning the

**00:33:37** environment to like 50 percent. And then the headset does like they understand this concept of like

**00:33:44** you're walking out of Mount Hood and back into Mount Hood and the script is in Mount Hood.

**00:33:52** It is like similarly so strange like look over on the other side of the room and it's like a portal.

**00:33:58** Yeah. It's really weird. That's the only way to describe it is it is a bit like a portal.

**00:34:03** The other thing that is like I still I find like the headset pulls this trick on me all the time

**00:34:09** that I forget, which is so I'm always in environment dark mode. So it's always evening

**00:34:14** time in all my environments. So when I'm pacing back and forth and there is a portal to Mount

**00:34:21** Hood on one side of the room, when I pace back out, it darkens up the lights in the room that I'm in.

**00:34:29** And it's such a convincing effect that I am always completely startled when I take off the headset to

**00:34:36** realize, oh, this room is actually bright, like 100 percent brightness. I feel like it is evening

**00:34:43** time in this room. That is the thing that really makes this 50 percent environment that I can move

**00:34:51** out of and back into in a pacing situation. That's the thing that makes it convincing.

**00:34:57** They don't make it look like it's night outside the window, but they just dim all of the light

**00:35:02** in your physical environment. And it is always surprising that this hasn't really happened,

**00:35:08** that this isn't the real lighting situation that's around you.

**00:35:12** Because it's like, you know, if you think about it, what you're seeing is a camera feed.

**00:35:17** Like that's what you're seeing. It looks like ostensibly you can trick yourself,

**00:35:22** convince yourself that you are looking through the thing, but you're not. You're looking at a

**00:35:28** camera feed. And so Apple has complete control over how it displays the camera feed. And, you

**00:35:34** know, like some of the environments are just lighting effects. Like, do you want the light to

**00:35:39** look warm? Do you want the light to look cool? Like they can just change the color or the brightness

**00:35:44** of the light that they're displaying to you because it's just an image generated by a computer

**00:35:49** at the end of the day. When playing around with guest mode. So I've had three different people

**00:35:55** try this, my parents and my aunt. And when you put on guest mode, it has to do this eye calibration

**00:36:00** thing. You know, so it's like the dots, right? You've got to look at the dots and you've got

**00:36:03** to click the dots, but they also want you to do the dots in different lighting environments.

**00:36:08** And 100% of the time, the first time someone tries guest mode, they go,

**00:36:12** did you just turn down the lights? Did you just turn up the lights? It's like, no,

**00:36:16** it's such a convincing effect that it just feels like you put on this headset and then they slowly

**00:36:22** dim the lights. But it is completely convincing to you that in the physical environment,

**00:36:26** people have dimmed the lights on you or brightened the lights on you. It's really very impressive.

**00:36:31** So I guess what I'm saying here is this is another one of these details that I just really wouldn't

**00:36:36** have thought of, but the pacing works because of the thought that they put into what should it be

**00:36:44** like to have a continuity of experience when you're walking halfway in an environment like

**00:36:51** the lake and Mount Hood and halfway in the real world. And they've done an excellent job of

**00:36:58** kind of building one bubble around those two physical spaces that make them more continuous

**00:37:06** than they would be if it was just a pure portal and you were able to look at the rest of the room.

**00:37:11** It's very good. Pacing works with looking at a script. And I am very excited to try that on a

**00:37:19** graycation at some point. Speaking of which, maybe if it can trick you for lighting, it might

**00:37:24** be able to trick you for something else. Liz writes in to ask, will the Vision Pro solve Gray's

**00:37:29** hotel thermostat hacking issue? So if you were in the Yosemite Snowy environment,

**00:37:35** would that maybe trick your brain into thinking you were in a cooler environment?

**00:37:39** I feel like Liz is trying to provoke me here with this kind of question. Obviously,

**00:37:44** a virtual Antarctica helps with none of the actual problem that I am dealing with when I am

**00:37:51** in these hotels. But okay, so listen, I said before that I've been having this thought of like,

**00:37:59** what even is an office? And Liz is kind of hit upon incidentally with trying to provoke me,

**00:38:07** something that actually does kind of get to the heart of this question. So when I knew I was going

**00:38:13** to be in America for a long time, I was trying to figure out a little bit of like, okay, how can I

**00:38:19** have like somewhat of a normal schedule here? Because it's like, it's different when I visit

**00:38:26** my parents and it's like, Oh, I'm just going to be here for a week and whatever. But when it's more

**00:38:30** like, I'm going to be here for like a month, at least, I wanted to try to have some regular routine.

**00:38:36** And so I kind of shifted my schedule and I was getting up super duper early and going to the gym.

**00:38:41** And what I was thinking of was like, I need a place to work after the gym where I can just

**00:38:48** try to get like a little bit of stuff done. And I don't particularly like to work in my dad's office

**00:38:53** because I'm loud and noisy when I'm like the typing, it's like a super duper early in the morning.

**00:38:59** The house is not amazingly soundproof. So like, I just don't want to bother my parents. I'm like,

**00:39:02** where can I go? I was trying to think about all these different things and like,

**00:39:06** once the headset arrives, it was this feeling like, Oh, I don't like need to find an environment

**00:39:16** that's like a coffee shop that happens to be open at four in the morning. I don't need to find

**00:39:22** something like a coworking space that's open really early in the morning. I just need some quiet,

**00:39:30** private place to work because the thing that it just like slowly kept creeping into my mind is

**00:39:38** this headset creates a real separation between the mental you who's doing work, like your brain,

**00:39:48** your brain's internal experience, like, which is the only thing that you really are. And then like

**00:39:53** your physical body, which also has to be there. And it just, it really divides those two things

**00:39:59** quite sharply. And I was just aware of thinking like, Oh, most of the time when I'm trying to

**00:40:03** think about workspaces, you're trying to find some compromise between like, what can the cerebral

**00:40:10** you work in and what can the physical you also work in? So a bunch of mornings, I'd just be like,

**00:40:17** driving around in North Carolina and kind of thinking like, where's the place that I could go?

**00:40:21** Doesn't need to be a coffee shop. It doesn't need to be an office. I just need like some place I can

**00:40:25** go in the morning. And ideally, I'd like it to be temperature controlled. And it's like, just thinking

**00:40:30** of something like driving around. I'm like, I just need a small environment. It's like temperature

**00:40:35** controlled that I can work in and I'm driving around and where can I be? And suddenly I realized,

**00:40:41** Oh my God, I can work in this car. This car is the perfect office. This is the most amazing

**00:40:49** place to actually work because it is a small temperature controlled, extremely comfortable

**00:40:56** environment to work in. The garage office has warped your brain. I wasn't in the garage office.

**00:41:03** I just parked. I know. But it's walked your brain. You're like, Oh, garage, perfect place to work.

**00:41:10** You know, you're working every day hearing cars, cars, cars, seeing cars, and you're like, cars,

**00:41:15** perfect place to work. You know, your brain's being warped. But it actually is. So like I was driving

**00:41:20** my dad's Tesla and I've always thought like, boy, these Tesla seats are just, they're the most

**00:41:25** comfortable seats I've ever been in. And it's like, Ooh, turn on the heated seat, right? And then

**00:41:29** turn the air conditioning way down. And it's like, ah, perfect. This is the environment that I want

**00:41:34** to be in. Wait, what? You turn on the heated seat. Yeah. It's nice and cozy. But then you don't want

**00:41:42** to get too warm. So you turn the air conditioning to maximum low. And then this is perfect. You're in

**00:41:48** like homeostasis with the environment. What do you mean you don't understand? Have you never done

**00:41:54** this? It's the most comfortable way to be. But what benefit does the heated seat provide? It's

**00:41:58** comfortable. But you're cold. Like, what do you mean? What benefit does the heated seat provide? But

**00:42:02** if you want it to be cold, then why do you want the heat to be on the seat? I don't get it. Have

**00:42:09** you never done this? Have you never had the air conditioning on in the car and also the heated

**00:42:13** seat? No, I've never done this. Mike, you haven't lived. This is great. Heated seats are for when

**00:42:19** it's cold and air conditioning is for when it's hot. Listen to what you just said. You just said

**00:42:23** the same thing yourself, Mike. Heated seats are for when it's cold. And so the air conditioning

**00:42:29** makes it cold. You don't need to create the cold. But you can. That's the point of air conditioning.

**00:42:34** I can't get my head around this one. Sorry. I don't understand what this gives you.

**00:42:38** It gives me the optimal environment to work in is what it gets me. It's the absolute perfect thing.

**00:42:46** Whatever you say. This was mind blowing. And so now the only thing I needed since I was out in

**00:42:52** the world was also a way to like cover up the windows, perhaps of the car. Cause I'm like,

**00:42:58** well, right. I don't want to be like a weirdo. You didn't want to go viral on social media,

**00:43:04** basically is what you're saying. Yes. No, I actually, no joke. I was aware of that. I was like,

**00:43:10** you know what? I don't want to end up. I don't want to end up a viral sensation where someone

**00:43:16** sees that glowing face plate at 5 a.m. while I'm working in like the gym parking lot at this 24

**00:43:25** hours. Tell you how funny it would be for you to go viral in that way because no one booty would

**00:43:35** know it was you. Yeah. Well, no, so I wasn't going to have that. I know. Right. So it's like right

**00:43:39** onto Amazon and like Tesla privacy screen. Here we go. Amazing. Do you know what an office is,

**00:43:46** Mike? It's a car. That's what an office is. This is perfect. It was so revelatory. And one of these

**00:43:54** ways, it was like, what even is an office? And it's like, ah, the problem I'm trying to solve

**00:44:00** is I just need my physical body to be comfortable while I'm working. And this is now a totally

**00:44:09** unrelated problem from the working environment for my brain, which is inside the headset. These

**00:44:17** two things are no longer connected. They are divorced and it is glorious. This episode of

**00:46:32** continued support of cortex and all of Relay FM. All right. Rob asks, I think you've touched on it

**00:46:39** before, but would be interested in why you've chosen not to go a Kickstarter route with new

**00:46:44** product launches to help you when you put a lot of capital into sidekick notepad reorders.

**00:46:50** I confess I sometimes grow tired of established companies going to Kickstarter, but it has never

**00:46:54** stopped me from supporting them and buying the product. Kind of like a pre-order. Why don't you

**00:46:59** do this? I am not opposed to Kickstarter. Similarly, I back lots of Kickstarters. I've done some

**00:47:06** Kickstarters in the past for the pan addict when we did some live shows in the past and we did

**00:47:10** Kickstarter campaigns for them. For the products that we have done and the products that we are

**00:47:16** working on, I don't believe that we have needed to rely on something like a crowdfunding route to do

**00:47:23** it because they are bets that I am have been confident enough in that I believe that we could

**00:47:32** put the capital into them. Maybe it might be like, oh, this is going to sell slowly,

**00:47:37** but it's going to sell, which is going to sell out over time. I think that there is an element of if

**00:47:43** we're able to offer a product and people can just give us their money and get the product in a few

**00:47:49** days, that is the preferable thing to do, in my opinion. I could imagine a scenario where one day

**00:47:55** we have an idea that is really complex and really expensive to make and in that scenario,

**00:48:03** maybe a Kickstarter is the only way to get it started. If we were making something,

**00:48:09** it costs us $100 a unit to produce. That's just too much money to buy 10,000 of them or whatever.

**00:48:20** If it was a scenario like that where it's like, oh, you can make this product for X,

**00:48:24** but your minimum order is really high, like really high. Then we just can't afford it.

**00:48:31** Then I could imagine maybe doing it. For me, I do feel that if we are able to do it,

**00:48:36** which we have been, I would prefer to do it this way because I like the idea of a consumer can

**00:48:42** give you their money and receive the item. I completely agree with you on that. Also,

**00:48:46** scenarios like the Sidekick Notepad and the amount of time it took to produce has reinforced that

**00:48:52** for me. It took us a year and a half from when we received the first sample before we had them

**00:48:57** shipping. I couldn't live with myself in that scenario. I would be going out of my mind of

**00:49:03** guilt that we had taken people's money and then told them, oh, it will be ready in three months.

**00:49:10** Then a year later, that is something that I would struggle to feel comfortable with.

**00:49:15** As we are still especially learning production of items, I'm also not comfortable doing a

**00:49:23** Kickstarter campaign. I feel like this is something that over time, we may get into the scenario that

**00:49:28** we're willing to take the kind of bet that a Kickstarter would need, but I don't foresee that

**00:49:34** any time in our immediate future. I'm working on a few ideas for products now, but we're still

**00:49:40** going to be able to fund them in the traditional way, I think. I just think for us, we've not

**00:49:44** needed to do it. Yeah, this question kind of reminds me that I think when we really started

**00:49:51** doing this sort of thing, I was more in the position that Rob was kind of asking about, where

**00:49:56** I feel like I just didn't have a clear understanding of the distinction of what we're doing, which is

**00:50:02** placing the order and then trying to sell the product and something like Kickstarter.

**00:50:06** And I think I was kind of like... My memory of how these conversations went was basically that

**00:50:12** I was originally on the side of like, well, of course you do a Kickstarter, right? Because if

**00:50:15** it doesn't work, then there's no problem. But I think I didn't really perceive the problem of,

**00:50:22** yes, but what if the Kickstarter does work? And I just hadn't really been thinking it through.

**00:50:28** And it's like the Kickstarter's... It's a very particular kind of tool that in some ways is

**00:50:36** used to try to de-risk a situation. Like you said, if you have a product that has a really

**00:50:41** high cost to produce, you need to know that you actually have orders for that thing. Like

**00:50:46** in that case, you're using Kickstarter to try to de-risk the thing. But on the smaller side of

**00:50:53** things, it feels to me now, like having spoken to you, like talked it through a bunch, that

**00:50:59** Kickstarter is kind of riskier for smaller to medium projects in a way. Like you said, you can

**00:51:06** be on the hook. And if something comes up, you just feel real guilty because it's taken

**00:51:11** like a whole year to do this thing. So I feel the same way, obviously, like it's not that I would

**00:51:17** never do a Kickstarter for anything, but I think I did not previously appreciate how specific of a

**00:51:24** tool it is that you really want to be intentional about when does it make sense to do this. And I

**00:51:29** think that having uncertainty about something tells you the answer. And if you are uncertain,

**00:51:36** if you want to do a Kickstarter or do something more traditional, your uncertainty is the answer

**00:51:43** that you should probably do it in a more traditional way, which is why we've done that for everything

**00:51:48** that we've done up to this point in time. And again, like the sidekick notepad is just like

**00:51:51** for me another example, like a great example of my gut feeling for I didn't want to do a

**00:51:55** Kickstarter for it, which was how the product began and ended. It was in a very different place.

**00:52:01** And we would have been locked into the original ideas of the product if we would have done a

**00:52:06** Kickstarter for it, because you kind of if you present it something to someone in a certain way

**00:52:10** for a certain price, you kind of have to stick to that. But we ended up with a better product,

**00:52:15** it just became more expensive to produce, therefore the price was higher. Yeah, you have sold people

**00:52:20** on a specific thing. And so you're making that thing. And you have to be real certain that there

**00:52:27** is a 0% chance you're going to change your idea about what's the better version of this later.

**00:52:34** That's the thing that you can't do with Kickstarter. There are people every day

**00:52:37** launching Kickstarter campaigns, and they know what they're doing in that regard. Yeah. But we're,

**00:52:42** I think, too early, or at least I feel like I am not experienced enough, where I feel confident

**00:52:47** in being like my initial idea. That's the idea, you know, like, I don't feel confident in that,

**00:52:53** where I feel like I could say like, hey, back this project, it's going to be just like this,

**00:52:59** because so far, that has not been the case. And we'll continue to be I think for a bit. Yeah,

**00:53:06** I was just flipping through the roster of stuff that we have done and stuff that's in development.

**00:53:10** And I think every single one of those products, the point at which we could theoretically have

**00:53:15** done a Kickstarter would have been the wrong time, because it changed significantly from that point.

**00:53:22** And it's been real great to be able to go real slow with some things and get them just the way

**00:53:28** we want them to be, which is, again, not an option with Kickstarter, which is, you know,

**00:53:32** this is the weird way in which, in a sense, like Cortex brand right now is a side business for both

**00:53:39** of us. Right. And so we're able to do things in a slightly different way to other companies that

**00:53:48** do what we do, but it's their living, where we're able to keep cash in the business to invest into

**00:53:54** new products and into new inventory, rather than needing it for our salary. And because that's just

**00:53:59** where we are as a business is what we're doing. But I like that because it's like we're funding

**00:54:04** our own growth. And I think for what I want and what we want this business to be, it makes a lot

**00:54:09** of sense to do it that way for right now. So and then we're able to pass the benefit of it not being

**00:54:14** a Kickstarter on to the customer. Yeah, Kickstarter's costume more. That's the yeah, it's a very,

**00:54:19** very complicated process. And people can do it really right. And it can be a great marketing

**00:54:24** tool. And that's why a lot of established companies still use it. But also similarly,

**00:54:29** we have great marketing tools already. Like, you know, if we were going to do a Kickstarter

**00:54:36** for a product, you'd be hearing about it on the show. So why not just make the thing and tell you

**00:54:41** about it on the show? You know, that is a really funny way to frame it, but it's 100% correct.

**00:54:46** Nick asks, how soon after waking up, do both of you begin actively engaging with your phone or

**00:54:53** another screen? Phone or another screen? I guess that's a Mac, right? Or an iPad. Any screen. Okay,

**00:54:59** you go first, Mike. Okay, it's immediate. It's immediate. Right. So like, my alarm goes off.

**00:55:07** I snooze it a couple of times. And then eventually, I grabbed my phone to turn off the alarm. And

**00:55:16** the next thing that I do is look at my notifications. You look at your notifications,

**00:55:19** the very first thing when you wake up. Yeah. Are you out of bed yet? No. Really?

**00:55:24** That's hardcore. No. That's what people do. This is the unhealthy relationship. We have other devices.

**00:55:30** That feels like the real hair of the dog that bit you. Like, yeah, but I look right at my

**00:55:34** notifications. The solution for this problem is to not use my phone as my alarm. If I didn't do that,

**00:55:41** the situation would be different. But I have my phone in my hand, right? Turn off my alarm. And

**00:55:48** so therefore, I've gotten myself into the habit of like, immediately like, all right, what's going

**00:55:53** on? What emails did I get? What text messages did I get? And then I'll spend a few minutes to more

**00:55:59** than a few minutes sometimes dealing with whatever's on my phone before I get out of bed in the morning.

**00:56:04** I mean, in fairness to you, our time zone in the UK does make this more tempting. I think that's

**00:56:11** just natural. Like when you go to bed, America is still doing stuff for a while. Yes, but still,

**00:56:17** I could still wait 20 minutes. It waited for four hours. I guess that's true. Yeah. Because

**00:56:23** America is not going to be up for a while is the other thing. Yeah, exactly. But this is just

**00:56:29** part of the relationship with our devices. It's unhealthy in some ways. It's fine in others.

**00:56:37** I think by and large, I consider this to be okay. Because I do feel like I do a good job of managing

**00:56:46** the types of notifications that I get. And so, you know, what I am getting notifications for

**00:56:53** is kind of stuff that I want. Like I'm not getting breaking news alerts, right? Or whatever,

**00:56:58** you know, like it is typically people or things that I care about and would like to know about.

**00:57:07** So, you know, I'm happy about in that regard. But still, it could wait 20 minutes. But no,

**00:57:11** it doesn't. It's the first thing I do in the morning. If it was waiting 20 minutes,

**00:57:15** what in theory in your life would it be waiting 20 minutes for? What do you mean? I mean, I feel

**00:57:20** like implicitly you're saying something like you'd be brushing your teeth and getting ready for the

**00:57:24** day. Just waking up, talking to my wife, you know, like any of these things, right, would be better.

**00:57:30** Like waiting until I've at least made coffee, you know, just because it's like, let's just like,

**00:57:36** remove the phone and the outside world, like for just a little bit longer, just like a little bit

**00:57:41** longer. I don't know. I feel like I'm actually kind of disagreeing with you on that. I feel like

**00:57:44** if you're going to check your messages in 20 minutes, you might as well check them when you

**00:57:47** wake up. Yeah. This is what I'm trying to get at is you're like, you're not trying to save yourself

**00:57:51** or anything here. So I think you should feel less guilty about it. If I was able to not look at my

**00:57:55** phone for that period of time, then I would at least be proving to myself that I don't need to.

**00:58:00** Okay. All right. That's very different. So now we're having a literal addiction conversation.

**00:58:05** We're not having a like, what are you doing with your morning conversation? Because that's the

**00:58:08** situation, right? Whereas like, if I could just leave it a little bit longer, then maybe I'll be

**00:58:13** able to tell myself that like, I don't need to look at it. Right. But like that is the strongest

**00:58:18** indication of the habitual or addiction, whatever you'd want to call it nature of me using my phone

**00:58:25** would be that I could start my day doing anything else than checking my phone first.

**00:58:31** But that is what I will always start with. Well, okay. It's not like a media immediate. Like,

**00:58:38** I do actually spend time with my wife in the morning before looking at my phone, but it's not

**00:58:46** a lot of time. You know what I mean? Like the phone is very fast into the morning part,

**00:58:52** or I might like check it, put my phone down, you know, we'll talk for a bit or whatever,

**00:58:56** and then wake up. But it's very early in my wake up process is checking my smartphone.

**00:59:01** I'm going to ask a dumb, more morning person question. My impression of your workday is that

**00:59:07** it's very late shifted. Yeah. So like, what do you even say in these alarms for in the morning? Like,

**00:59:13** why don't you just get up later? I have to get up. Although, cause Greg, I won't.

**00:59:20** You just like die in bed. If you don't send the alarm. Look left to my own devices. I sleep to

**00:59:25** 1pm. Oh, okay. All right. So that's what you're trying to avoid. Even though yes, my day is late

**00:59:31** shifted. I like to be out of bed by nine. Have you ever tried to sleeping to 1pm and like shifting

**00:59:37** your whole day? I absolutely don't want to live my life that way. Okay. I really don't want to do

**00:59:42** that. You could call it Mike master time though. Right? That would be great. No, I really don't

**00:59:47** want to because I actually, you know, I over time, like the things that I would do before lunch,

**00:59:52** like I like to do that work before lunch, you know, so like I've kind of got into this mode,

**00:59:58** but you know, so I go to bed about 1 30 and I wake up between eight 30 and nine 30. That's

**01:00:03** like a typical day for me, but I want to be awake, you know, I think you should try Mike master. No,

**01:00:10** I really don't want to. I really, really don't want to live my life that way, but it might be

**01:00:14** amazing. No, what I would prefer to do is not work so late. Like that would be my preference,

**01:00:21** but that's the thing to deal with another time. I don't know. I just think you should feel less

**01:00:25** bad about this situation. I feel like you're, you're actually fine here.

**01:00:29** About checking my phone.

**01:00:30** Yeah. About checking the phone. I feel like this is fine.

**01:00:32** So what do you do then?

**01:00:33** There's like a continual fight here that I am never satisfied with. So again, like in some

**01:00:39** sense, the answer to the actual question of like, how soon do you begin actively engaging with your

**01:00:44** phone or another screen? My answer is the same as you, which is like, Oh, it's functionally instant.

**01:00:48** Oh, okay. I would not have expected that.

**01:00:50** But like the phone is waking me up and then when things go well, I am trying to use the phone as a

**01:00:59** kind of guidance for the morning. Like I have a little morning routine checklist that I want to

**01:01:05** check things off. Very often I'll wake up with particularly if like, um, really knee deep in,

**01:01:11** in some complicated projects, like I'll wake up with thoughts about that project. So I'll want

**01:01:16** to take notes straight away. This is like instantly is the answer. This is the same way.

**01:01:21** That's when things go well in my morning, like an iPad or the phone, they're like immediate

**01:01:28** companions in some way.

**01:01:30** Well, okay. Let me ask a slightly modified version of the question. But I actually think

**01:01:34** is what the question is asking of like, how long until you're interacting with another person and

**01:01:40** like either reading something someone sent you or sending something to someone?

**01:01:44** So this was what I was going to try to get to is this is the conflict. It's funny to do this

**01:01:49** question now because I'm in just particular awareness again, like because the family things

**01:01:53** have had to be looking at messages much earlier in the morning than I normally would be. So I've

**01:01:59** just been like checking things when I'm up and there's like this thing that, okay, so focus

**01:02:04** modes have made this much better over time with like, how do you handle notifications? But

**01:02:14** fundamentally the conflict for me is still this thing. Like I don't like that messages,

**01:02:19** like text messages are in the notification center. I've never quite found a satisfactory way

**01:02:28** to try to get messages when I do want them, but also not see them when I don't want them.

**01:02:35** It just always feels like no matter how I try to turn the dials of being excluded from the world

**01:02:42** or included into the world, it's hard to find this right balance. And a lot of times I'm sort of

**01:02:49** frustrated if I like, I need something in notification center and then I can see like,

**01:02:54** oh, there's a bunch of messages that are just waiting there for me. It's like,

**01:02:56** I don't want to see these for a couple of hours. The problem that you have here,

**01:03:00** which I know you know, is that notification center is built for the receipt of messages from people.

**01:03:07** Yeah. That is the primary focus of the entire part of the operating system.

**01:03:11** Oh yeah. Yeah. It is a thing that I am aware that I love the Apple ecosystem,

**01:03:18** but there is a thing about it, which is Contra to me, which is how much they want you to engage with

**01:03:24** other people in all of the things that you're doing. And it is maybe my most consistent design

**01:03:30** frustration with them. Even just recently, like I, this is another one of these, like,

**01:03:35** I got to go in the settings and figure out where to turn this thing off. But I'm so aware now of

**01:03:39** when I'm texting with someone, if I look at one of my notes, it pops up like,

**01:03:42** Hey, do you want to live collaborate with this person you're talking with on this note?

**01:03:46** It's like, why is this button even here? Never, never is when I want to do this.

**01:03:53** What are you laughing at there, Mike? No, it's because I find it weird too.

**01:03:57** Division Pro is even worse. Like, yeah, if you're having a FaceTime call with someone,

**01:04:03** any app you're looking at a little button appears above it where it's like collaborate or like share

**01:04:08** screen. And it's like, no, like I'm just, I'm reading an iMessage from somebody else.

**01:04:13** I don't need this to be shared. Like we're good. I haven't seen that. I was agreeing because I'm

**01:04:19** so aware of how they made a decision that their top level thing is like there's three things.

**01:04:25** There's apps, there's environments, and then there's people. It's like they pulled out people

**01:04:31** as this top level thing. I think that's a real design decision. I understand why they do it,

**01:04:37** but this is where I find Apple most greats on me is they're constantly trying to get me to be

**01:04:47** outward directed. And I spend a huge amount of time essentially trying to protect myself from

**01:04:54** the outside, right? I want to be as inward directed as is possible. And one of the things

**01:05:00** that has happened is like, as time has gone on and like technology goes on and continues to improve,

**01:05:06** I was trying during year of work to do a thing which was trying to just like shut off my internet

**01:05:14** at like the house level or the Euro level or the device level. So I would know when I woke up,

**01:05:21** like, oh, I don't have any messages on my phone because my phone wasn't connected to the internet

**01:05:26** at all. But the problem here is that if you do this, like if you set up shortcuts to try to just

**01:05:31** disconnect your phone from the internet, the phone basically literally fights you the whole

**01:05:36** time being like, oh, hey, you know, you have there's like a Wi-Fi connection here and you're

**01:05:40** just not connected. Do you want to connect to this? And like, oh, there's a cell connection here. If you

**01:05:44** press the cell connection button, you'll be connected to it. It's like, I know I told you to

**01:05:49** turn off. It is trying to reach out and connect to things. And it just will not accept that like a

**01:05:56** person doesn't want to be on the Wi-Fi because I don't want messages to be able to reach me and

**01:06:02** then live in notification center where I can either accidentally know they're there or just

**01:06:06** simply be tempted by the fact that they're there. Now there's many ways in which I completely

**01:06:10** recognize this like wildly unreasonable. And it is a thing that I gave up because it also was just

**01:06:17** so impractical in many ways because you forget like, oh, all of my home controls require that

**01:06:23** I'm connected to the internet. Like there's a hundred things that I can't even think of right

**01:06:26** now that like require a connection to my phone or like there's something that's happening where I

**01:06:31** can't just like put the phone in airplane mode or whatever it is. So this is a thing that for me is

**01:06:37** just kind of an unsolved problem. There really isn't a way around it. Like what I actually want

**01:06:45** is a magical thing that says no one can contact me unless they really need to, but I get to judge

**01:06:53** if they really need to. That's really what I want. But like kind of focus mode do this.

**01:06:57** Okay. Let me try to clarify a thing here. What I realize is a thing that I would want

**01:07:04** is the ability for focus modes to also do something like change the settings of how messages are

**01:07:13** actually able to be delivered to the device. Okay. That's not something that you can do

**01:07:18** with focus modes. It's not something that you can do with settings. So the problem is that I have to

**01:07:26** have the settings for in general, how our messages received set a certain way at the system setting

**01:07:34** level. And you realize this when you dig in the settings, the focus modes are not designed from

**01:07:41** the perspective of you are like using this device in the focus mode. They're really in a way

**01:07:48** designed from the perspective of to not interrupt you. But that means while you are using the device

**01:07:57** stuff is piling up in notification center. And that's where like you just know that it's there

**01:08:03** waiting for you. It's easy to accidentally see it when you're just trying to pull up something in

**01:08:10** control center. Like that's the problem. That is like basically unsolvable is a crazy requirement

**01:08:17** of engineering that like I would just want for me when to be honest, focus modes have already gone

**01:08:22** beyond my wildest reasonable expectations of what an operating system would do. But I'm just aware,

**01:08:29** like this is always going to be a frustration for me and is also a frustration for everybody

**01:08:35** who ever interacts with me. Because whenever I'm trying to fix this problem, it's always the same

**01:08:39** thing. I go way too far that my wife's like, I've tried to call you seven times and none of them

**01:08:44** got through. And it's like, oh, no, right? Like I put the dials the wrong way. Phones off.

**01:08:50** Yeah, because the situation you're saying is like, while it won't annoy you, you'll see like

**01:08:56** receive while you're in focus. And you know this stuff in there, where you don't want the

**01:09:01** temptation of knowing this stuff in there. Yeah. And there's way too many tricky edge cases of like

**01:09:07** switching between focus modes, right? So it's like, oh, when you go from sleep, and then I have

**01:09:11** like a core working focus mode, but then I also have like the exercise focus mode. When you're

**01:09:16** going between those things, that's also a place where like stuff can bleed over for a moment.

**01:09:21** There's just a lot of these little edge cases that are not obvious when you first start to think

**01:09:24** about them. But yes, so I guess the answer to the question is instantly start engaging and often

**01:09:30** much sooner than I ideally would want to but I spend a lot of time trying to make that not

**01:09:36** happen as often as possible. This episode of Cortex is brought to you by Notion. There's no

**01:09:42** shortage of helpful AI tools out there right now. But using them means switching back and forth

**01:09:47** between multiple apps, multiple websites or other tools. So instead of simplifying your workflow,

**01:09:52** it ends up just becoming more complicated. Unless of course, you're in Notion. Notion combines your

**01:09:57** notes, your documents and your projects into one space that's simple and beautifully designed.

**01:10:02** You can save time and write faster by letting Notion AI handle the first draft for you,

**01:10:07** jumpstart a brainstorm or turn your messy notes into something more polished. Here at Cortex

**01:10:12** brand, we use Notion AI to summarize notes from meetings to pull out the action items. So it's

**01:10:17** really easy for us to know what the next steps are going to be. You can automate all these tedious

**01:10:21** tasks, you can have stuff summarized for you, you can find next steps really easily. Notion AI does

**01:10:26** all this and more and frees you up to do the deep work. And the fully integrated Notion AI will help

**01:10:32** you work faster, write better and think bigger. Doing tasks that normally take you time, maybe

**01:10:37** minutes, maybe hours into seconds. Notion is used by over half of the Fortune 500 companies and teams

**01:10:43** that use Notion send less email, cancel more meetings, save time searching for their work

**01:10:47** and reduce spending on tools, which helps keep everyone on the same page. The more and more that

**01:10:52** I'm using Notion for Cortex brand, the more and more that's going in it. It is an incredibly

**01:10:57** powerful and flexible tool. One of my very favorite things about Notion is the way in which you can

**01:11:01** take the same set of data, say like one database and display it in a bunch of different ways.

**01:11:06** Like do you want it in a list? Do you want it in a board? Super simple. And it can make a massive

**01:11:11** change to how you act and use information when you're able to surface it in so many different

**01:11:16** ways. It's such a powerful tool. I mean, I started using Notion Calendar as well now recently.

**01:11:21** It's really amazing. You should go and check it out for yourself, which you could do for free.

**01:11:25** Just go to Notion.com slash Cortex or lowercase letters, notion.com slash cortex, and you could

**01:11:32** try out the powerful, easy to use Notion AI today. And when you go to Notion.com slash cortex,

**01:11:38** you're also helping support the show as well. A thanks to Notion for the continued support of

**01:11:42** this show, RealAFM, and for making my work that little bit easier.

**01:11:47** Brance asks, Mike, now that you are settled into your new home, is there a chance that you'll

**01:11:51** shut down MegaStudio and work slash podcast from home? Or does continuing to have MegaStudio

**01:11:57** contribute to your year of the weekend theme and help keep a firm line between work and life?

**01:12:02** I could not imagine working from home again. I'm not surprised to hear that.

**01:12:08** I really like having a dedicated space to work in. I think it is very valuable for me

**01:12:16** because of the type of work that I do to have an element of control with the sound,

**01:12:24** an element of control of distraction. It's very good for me to just be in an environment where

**01:12:33** people aren't going to bother me one way or another. And or I don't have to worry that I

**01:12:38** am inconveniencing people. When I used to record at home in our apartment, it was very conscious

**01:12:45** to me that like, Adina was stuck, you know? What do you mean? She did something she couldn't do.

**01:12:51** Right? If she wanted to do something that will cause noise at home, she couldn't do it.

**01:12:55** Yeah.

**01:12:56** Because I'm recording. And so like, it wouldn't work. And I didn't like that feeling.

**01:13:02** If she just, you know, wants to watch Game of Thrones, it's just like, well,

**01:13:07** you've got to do it quietly, you know? And it's just like, this is not good. I don't like that

**01:13:11** feeling. But I also just really like having a space of my own that I can do whatever I want with.

**01:13:17** And I can set it up just in the way that I need to do all of the things that I want to do.

**01:13:22** I also think it's so good for me for work life balance, being in the two different places. Like,

**01:13:29** it's again, it's like year of the weekend, the idea was you work on the days you work and you're

**01:13:36** off on the days you're off. And so you had these things you have to balance, you have to find a

**01:13:42** balance between them. And I find that to be the same with having home and office like, inherently

**01:13:48** they're being two things means that they balance against each other. And then I can work to make

**01:13:53** sure that balance is correct. But I like the fact that they are separate entities that I get to

**01:13:59** spend time in and do whatever it is I want to do in each. Like, I think I've gone very good

**01:14:05** at not working at home. That's really good to hear. Also, just to add as someone who has visited

**01:14:09** Mega Studio, I think the thing that brands might not be realizing is that Mega Studio has also

**01:14:16** become the de facto Cortex brand headquarters. And when I think about Mega Studio, I think about

**01:14:24** the amount of physical stuff that you have in there is astounding. Like when I go over there and

**01:14:31** you delightedly want to show me paper samples or color samples of things, or just notebooks that

**01:14:37** you're looking at or prototypes or like all of these things, there's no way you could get rid of

**01:14:43** Mega Studio. It's just not possible anymore. I would need an actually bigger home. It's like,

**01:14:49** it's not good. Because like now my work has physicality to it where it didn't before.

**01:14:55** Now I have cabinets which have samples in them and I keep versions of every print of every product

**01:15:01** that I can refer back to. And I have boxes of a couple of hundred sidekick notepads that we send

**01:15:07** out for people to review and stuff like that. Like I have all this stuff that needs this space.

**01:15:13** And then also, I mean, I'm going to make some adaptations to Mega Studio soon to even make that

**01:15:19** better. Like I don't have space to be able to lay things out on like a large desk to be able to look

**01:15:25** at them clearly, like comparing this paper to that paper and da da da. So I love having this space.

**01:15:31** It's very important to me. Like even if my family situation changed, all I could imagine is like

**01:15:38** maybe I would come to the studio fewer days a week, but I need to have like a set environment

**01:15:45** now where my work is done. And the funny thing about the Cortex brand stuff, like now I imagine

**01:15:50** this scenario where like into the future and we've joked about it, but like there is an actual place

**01:15:56** where the Cortex brand stuff happens. Like I can imagine it more and more like there's a shop,

**01:16:02** you know, like a store, like we have a place, which is the headquarters and it has a little

**01:16:07** storefront in the front. Like this is my 10 year dream now, you know? Yeah. I am aware of that as

**01:16:13** like a, what feels to be like it may be the slight sound of approaching inevitability. That does feel

**01:16:19** like a little bit. Yeah. I do have a dream of having a place more that I can do more to like,

**01:16:26** it can have more say over like I'm renting this unit in a big building and I would like to have

**01:16:32** something that was a longer term rental contract like a, or like a longer term lease, or even the

**01:16:38** opportunity to try and at some point buy a unit somewhere to be able to have more say over it.

**01:16:44** And as time goes on further and further, the likelihood that that thing could have a shop

**01:16:51** front in the front feels more and more possible, which I also kind of like the idea of. So yeah,

**01:16:58** for me, I can only imagine the need for a non-home working place to increase rather than decrease.

**01:17:08** The only way you could get rid of mega studio is if you had giga home. That's the only way it would

**01:17:13** need to be a hundred times bigger. Even then though, I like to commute, like I get 45 minutes

**01:17:20** of exercise in every day with the walking and I get to listen to my podcasts and I have a separation

**01:17:28** between the two that like it's, I can at least try and leave some of my work brain at the office. And

**01:17:36** like I have the time between the two where I can kind of get a bit more into home mic rather than

**01:17:41** work mic. I get it. As weird as this sounds in North Carolina, I kind of enjoyed the commute

**01:17:49** in a sense. Like I enjoyed being up early and driving to the gym and then just like

**01:17:56** being at a physical distance away. It's like, yeah, I can totally get that. Well, when Cortex brand

**01:18:02** retail headquarters has a place one day, there might be an office for you in it. I require a

**01:18:06** secret entrance. Like is what I require. Just a full privacy screen and a heated chair and air

**01:18:12** conditioning. Well, yeah, of course. If we're custom building it, of course that energy bill.

**01:18:19** I'm not looking forward to that energy bill. Energy is cheap. Mike brain power is expensive.
