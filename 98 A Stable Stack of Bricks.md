# Cortex - 98: A Stable Stack of Bricks
**00:00:00** Record.

**00:00:00** I can confirm I am recording.

**00:00:02** Levels, levels.

**00:00:03** Levels, levels.

**00:00:04** I'm also talking really close to the microphone.

**00:00:07** Thank you.

**00:00:07** To try to do it the way you want.

**00:00:08** Like a professional, you mean.

**00:00:10** Yeah.

**00:00:10** Yeah.

**00:00:11** I just want you happy with my microphone set up.

**00:00:14** But I also want my microphone set up the way I want it to be.

**00:00:17** There is not a consensus in the middle of those two things.

**00:00:22** They are too very.

**00:00:24** It's like a rock and a hard place.

**00:00:25** You know.

**00:00:28** Well, look, we recorded today.

**00:00:30** We're connected.

**00:00:31** We're good.

**00:00:31** Levels, levels went perfect.

**00:00:33** So we're all set.

**00:00:35** How's Flotant Times on working for you?

**00:00:36** I saw you tweet that you were very excited that since our last episode,

**00:00:40** the OmniFocus beta is now OmniFocus stable.

**00:00:44** And the most recent update brought with it Flotant Times on support.

**00:00:48** Well, one, have you enabled it?

**00:00:50** Two, have you tested it?

**00:00:51** Right.

**00:00:52** Well, you immediately put a little rain cloud on my happy parade

**00:00:57** by putting the idea in my head of, oh, I hope your database migration goes fine.

**00:01:02** So.

**00:01:04** I was surprised.

**00:01:06** I was trying to get a rise out of you.

**00:01:08** And I was surprised that you didn't say anything back.

**00:01:11** But now I've achieved because you haven't got it out of your head clearly,

**00:01:14** which makes me feel even better.

**00:01:16** Right.

**00:01:17** Well, what you should imagine is that when I tweeted something like,

**00:01:22** long have I waited for this day, and the smile on my face,

**00:01:27** and then you said to me, I hope that database migration goes well.

**00:01:31** Just imagine the lids of my eyes slightly narrowing in annoyance at you.

**00:01:37** That was sort of my reaction.

**00:01:38** I'm like, I'm not going to dignify this with a reply.

**00:01:42** I know what he wants.

**00:01:43** I'm not going to give him what he wants.

**00:01:44** You know that what you're doing right now,

**00:01:46** this is so much better for me than any reply you could have given.

**00:01:50** Right.

**00:01:51** Well, I feel very pleased about this.

**00:01:54** Good.

**00:01:54** I'm glad you're happy.

**00:01:55** It's not an unreasonable comment on your end.

**00:01:58** So I sort of waited a couple of days until the release had worked its way

**00:02:03** through all of my various devices, which have different frequencies of being

**00:02:07** actually connected to the Internet.

**00:02:09** And you get a little message from Omni, which says, hey, all your devices are ready.

**00:02:13** Would you like to upgrade your database?

**00:02:15** And so it had been a few days.

**00:02:16** I felt relatively comfortable.

**00:02:18** There was no emergency update.

**00:02:20** So yes, I updated.

**00:02:22** And then a beauty for the eye to behold.

**00:02:24** Now below in OmniFocus, where you select the date or the deferred date,

**00:02:30** there's a little little checkbox that says use floating time zones.

**00:02:35** Just in time for all the travel.

**00:02:38** Well, so this is like two weeks ago.

**00:02:43** I immediately opened up OmniFocus to my perspective where I can see every single

**00:02:48** task that I have currently available or at any time in the future.

**00:02:52** I did a select all very carefully checked the use floating time zones button.

**00:02:59** And as far as I can tell, everything went great.

**00:03:02** But yes, it is a little bit of a gift of the Magi situation because it was a week

**00:03:08** before I started getting concerned about coronavirus and then two weeks before when

**00:03:13** everybody started getting concerned about coronavirus.

**00:03:16** And so, you know, because you've been trying to nail me down for cortex scheduling times.

**00:03:22** I had a summer of gray travel plan that started in April and ended in maybe July.

**00:03:30** Yeah, if all of the time I've known you, this was the wildest cortex my season that you

**00:03:36** were about to embark upon.

**00:03:37** No, summer of gray is not cortex.

**00:03:39** Right.

**00:03:40** Cortex is finally saying this now because I thought there was some cortex.

**00:03:44** This is the line that you have always given me.

**00:03:46** No, no, no.

**00:03:47** Like cortex is cortex is a relaxed time where there's no work or anything.

**00:03:53** Summer of gray is a travel time and is not cortex because it's extra stressful trying

**00:03:58** to fit in.

**00:03:59** When can cortex recordings happen?

**00:04:02** Cortex is a joyous time.

**00:04:04** Right.

**00:04:05** Right.

**00:04:06** Summer of gray, a summer of travel is much more mixed.

**00:04:08** Right.

**00:04:09** The emotional resonance is much more mixed, as is always the case where there's a bunch

**00:04:14** of conferences or events and you start committing to things and then I never like to change

**00:04:20** time zones if I don't absolutely have to.

**00:04:23** And so I always end up like combining a whole bunch of things together where I say, well,

**00:04:27** if there's only five days between these two events, I'm not going to go back to London

**00:04:31** and then return.

**00:04:32** That's crazy.

**00:04:33** Let me figure out something else I can do.

**00:04:35** So I had stuff that started on April 1st and was tentative to the end of June or July,

**00:04:43** depending on a few things.

**00:04:45** And basically after the floating time zones got implemented, I was like, wow, I'm really

**00:04:49** going to give this a workout this summer.

**00:04:51** One by one events started to cancel and I quickly was looking at a schedule that just

**00:04:57** didn't make sense anymore.

**00:04:58** And so like summer of gray is canceled.

**00:05:02** There is no summer of gray.

**00:05:03** All of my summer travel plans have been canceled.

**00:05:06** This is not happening.

**00:05:07** So while I do have floating time zones, I will not be in an environment to test their

**00:05:13** floatiness.

**00:05:14** Yeah.

**00:05:15** I will not be able to test their floatiness for, I don't know, months, September, maybe

**00:05:22** the earliest October.

**00:05:23** I don't know.

**00:05:24** Like we're going to have to see how this goes, but maybe not until 2021.

**00:05:27** We'll see.

**00:05:29** So thank you, OmniFocus.

**00:05:31** I'm really happy to have all those check boxes checked, but I will not actually be able to

**00:05:36** test them for maybe the rest of the year.

**00:05:38** One of the things that's been canceled is WWDC.

**00:05:40** Yes.

**00:05:41** Which I only really bring up at this point because it means we will not be doing our

**00:05:45** much loved in person, WWDC reactions episode, I guess.

**00:05:50** Yes.

**00:05:51** I have to say though, I've been waiting with bated breath for what is Apple going to do.

**00:05:56** And there were two things I thought were going to happen.

**00:05:59** I love, I love the way that Apple has done this.

**00:06:03** Their announcement is coming this summer, WWDC 20 brings a completely new online experience

**00:06:11** to millions of talented creative developers around the world.

**00:06:14** Join us for a fully packed program, keynote and sessions, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,

**00:06:19** blah.

**00:06:20** It's so Apple to be like coronavirus, never heard of it.

**00:06:23** I don't know what you're talking about.

**00:06:25** They mention it in their press release kind of.

**00:06:27** Oh, do they?

**00:06:28** In the press release, they say due to the global health concern and then they have it.

**00:06:33** They had another press release that went up a couple of days later talking about their

**00:06:38** coronavirus efforts.

**00:06:39** In that one, they mentioned a bit of DC being online.

**00:06:42** So it's like this reverse like stage process that they went through.

**00:06:48** But you know, I kind of get it right.

**00:06:49** Like in the W.B.D.C. thing, you don't want to bring it down.

**00:06:52** Like they want to make it like, don't worry.

**00:06:55** It's still going to be good and fun and great.

**00:06:58** You know, I get that.

**00:06:59** Like if I was writing that message, that's what I would do.

**00:07:01** Oh, I agree.

**00:07:02** Yeah, I agree.

**00:07:03** 100 percent.

**00:07:04** It's just it's just it's funny because it's so Apple, right?

**00:07:08** Yes.

**00:07:09** This is this is 100 percent what you would expect Apple to do.

**00:07:13** It's not wrong.

**00:07:14** I'm not saying it's bad, but it makes me laugh because it's just it's perfect.

**00:07:20** I am personally very frustrated about June.

**00:07:22** What do you mean?

**00:07:23** There's no date.

**00:07:24** Oh, I didn't even realize that right.

**00:07:26** Right.

**00:07:27** I have to plan my life around like when is W.B.D.C. going to be happening?

**00:07:31** Right.

**00:07:32** I have a lot of preparation to still do, even though I'm going to be at home now.

**00:07:35** But like in theory, this week may be busier in different ways because I will actually

**00:07:40** be able to consume all of the information, which I can't usually do because there's other

**00:07:44** things going on when we're in when we're at San Jose.

**00:07:46** Yeah.

**00:07:47** So I would really like to know when exactly they're going to do it.

**00:07:49** My personal theory of why is because they still I reckon would like to do a keynote

**00:07:54** where they invite press to come.

**00:07:56** And so they don't want to announce a date yet in case it's like, well, if we just did

**00:08:00** it a week later, we can do that.

**00:08:02** Right.

**00:08:03** But depending on what the situation will actually be like in June, because they don't have to

**00:08:07** have anybody plan anything, they can choose to date whenever is best for them.

**00:08:12** So I get why they've done it.

**00:08:13** But I would love to know when that date's going to be with a little bit of notice.

**00:08:18** Yeah, that's an interesting point.

**00:08:19** If your theory is right, you should assume that this is just like when Apple says, oh,

**00:08:25** the new whatever coming out in fall and you just you just say, OK, what is the last day

**00:08:32** that a reasonable person could remotely consider fall?

**00:08:36** And that that is when Apple is going to say, but I do think they need to give a bit of

**00:08:40** notice on this one, not just for people like me, but for actual developers who need to

**00:08:45** plan that like this, they're going to be learning for a week.

**00:08:48** Right.

**00:08:49** Like they are planning around like, OK, we've got to shut down a lot of our regular business

**00:08:52** activities because I'll be consuming courses and hopefully something we don't know yet.

**00:08:57** Like will there be any sessions that interactive things that we will allow between developers

**00:09:03** and Apple engineers?

**00:09:05** We don't know if any of that stuff's going to happen.

**00:09:07** And I'm sure they will.

**00:09:08** I reckon sometime in May they will announce the dates of all this stuff.

**00:09:11** I know there could be a possibility.

**00:09:13** We'll see how things go.

**00:09:14** Maybe you could come to mega studio and we could record in person for funsies.

**00:09:17** Don't plan on me to come.

**00:09:19** The grey household is in quarantine.

**00:09:20** Yeah, yeah.

**00:09:21** But again, you know, I'm trying to stay optimistic.

**00:09:24** Grey, like June is a way away.

**00:09:26** Yeah, no, June is a way away.

**00:09:27** I'm looking at the calendar and I think smart money is June 22nd to 26th if they want to

**00:09:34** do a whole like look at all these events and try to have a period of time.

**00:09:39** Yeah, and I've just three months, three months is a lot can happen in three months, you know.

**00:09:43** Yeah.

**00:09:44** But I'm just saying, like if you're trying to make money on when is WWDC, my top bet

**00:09:48** would be 22 to 26th and my second bet would be 29th to the third or they can be like,

**00:09:54** it started in June.

**00:09:55** It was that's totally June, June 29th.

**00:09:57** That's when WWDC is.

**00:10:00** While we're on this subject, I have a couple of rumors I would like to share with you.

**00:10:04** Okay.

**00:10:05** One is that there is a smart keyboard with a trackpad in the works for release sometime

**00:10:11** soon.

**00:10:12** Oh, yeah.

**00:10:13** The original idea is that this is going to come sometime in March, but who knows now,

**00:10:16** right?

**00:10:17** Yeah, but within you, I have pro which should be in theory debuted before sometime before

**00:10:22** the BBC.

**00:10:24** There is also a rumor of and like this has come from multiple sources now, a trackpad,

**00:10:29** smart keyboard in development, a trackpad, smart keyboard.

**00:10:32** So there will be a smart keyboard that integrates a trackpad inside of it.

**00:10:38** Oh, this is this is where sorry, it's like the Apple the Apple language sometimes gets

**00:10:42** me when I'm thinking like magic keyboard.

**00:10:45** Smart keyboard is the iPad keyboard, right?

**00:10:48** Right.

**00:10:49** The one that goes on the iPad.

**00:10:50** So like the smart folio or whatever you would call it with a trackpad inside of it.

**00:10:55** And then iOS 14 is expected to get full on cursor support.

**00:11:01** Like where would the trackpad go?

**00:11:03** Well, this is it, right?

**00:11:04** Like there is a lot of questions about how exactly they would make it like you could

**00:11:08** make a completely different product, something more like bridge where you have an integrated

**00:11:12** hinge, but that would make it a lot heavier or something I'd considered like you could

**00:11:16** maybe have an extra fold out portion which has a trackpad.

**00:11:20** You remember like the old smart keyboard used to be this origami nonsense, right?

**00:11:25** So they might move more towards something like that again to allow them to make that

**00:11:30** work.

**00:11:31** That's kind of something that I was wondering.

**00:11:33** But yeah, then so then potentially let's imagine they release it before WWDC before iPad OS

**00:11:40** 14 and they like say, oh, it has limited support via this means or whatever.

**00:11:45** But then with iOS 14 or iPad OS 14, it is expected now according to some new rumors

**00:11:51** from 9 to 5 Mac that there will be a full on cursor in iPad OS.

**00:11:58** I'm very excited about this.

**00:12:00** So when you say full on cursor, having now played with several times that accessibility

**00:12:05** feature, what does that mean compared to the current functionality?

**00:12:10** So this will apparently be pointers like you're used to like on a Mac, an arrow and

**00:12:16** a hand, those kinds of things.

**00:12:18** I wouldn't be surprised if it is represented slightly differently.

**00:12:22** But the idea is that it should look more like something you're used to.

**00:12:26** So quoting them, this includes support for multiple pointers depending on what is being

**00:12:30** hovered over, like switching from a standard arrow pointer to a pointing hand when hovering

**00:12:35** over links.

**00:12:36** That's really interesting.

**00:12:37** So gestures, right clicks, all that kind of stuff that's going to be coming in theory

**00:12:42** as part of iPad OS 14.

**00:12:44** That's very interesting.

**00:12:45** Are you excited?

**00:12:46** I'm absolutely thrilled by it.

**00:12:49** So like over the last week or so, I've pretty much just used my iPad in the stand with my

**00:12:56** keyboard and the mouse.

**00:12:57** Like that's how I've been using it.

**00:12:59** I have been I had a little bit of problem in my hand because of it because I was only

**00:13:03** using a mouse, right?

**00:13:05** Where like when I sit down at my iMac or if I use my iPad with not in the stand mode,

**00:13:10** I'm using more input devices.

**00:13:12** So like I'm just being mindful of that.

**00:13:14** I wish I could connect a trackpad to my iPad right now.

**00:13:17** So I had a way to separate between mouse and trackpad.

**00:13:21** But like that's just a thing I have to I have to just be a bit more smart about the way

**00:13:24** I'm doing that.

**00:13:25** Like I might get two different mice, you know, one more ergonomic or one more regular as

**00:13:29** a way to just just kind of as we spoke about in the past, both me and Gray do this.

**00:13:34** We have multiple input devices that we just cycle through and it just reduces the repetitive

**00:13:39** strain in any area.

**00:13:40** And that has been an absolute savior for me over the past years.

**00:13:45** Yeah.

**00:13:46** On my desk right now, the things I constantly switch between is I have the, you know, the

**00:13:50** MX Master 3 ergonomic mouse, but I also keep the MX Anywhere 2S just on the other side

**00:13:57** of my keyboard so that I can even just switch between the left and right hands and different

**00:14:00** device.

**00:14:01** Like it's such a lifesaver with RSI stuff being able to switch between two different

**00:14:05** things.

**00:14:06** So which MX are you using?

**00:14:08** The latest one, MX Master 3, I use that in my right hand because it's sculpted for the

**00:14:12** right hand.

**00:14:13** Right.

**00:14:14** But that's not the ergonomic one though.

**00:14:15** Oh, oh yeah.

**00:14:16** That's that is the other one that like so I cycle those two on my right hand, the trackball

**00:14:20** ergonomic one, right?

**00:14:22** I'll swap between that trackball and the regular mouse for my right hand.

**00:14:25** I haven't tried one of the trackball ones.

**00:14:28** Do you recommend I give that a go?

**00:14:29** Wait, which one are you talking about then when you mean the ergonomic one?

**00:14:32** Oh no, the vertical.

**00:14:34** I use the MX vertical.

**00:14:35** Oh, the vertical one.

**00:14:36** It's a model of their ergonomic knife.

**00:14:37** Okay, yes.

**00:14:38** So I did get the vertical one and I tried it, but I found for me it wasn't helpful.

**00:14:44** I felt like it was aggravating some stuff in my arm the way that it worked.

**00:14:47** I actually do find that a little bit so I don't use it all the time, but if I use it

**00:14:51** too much, it can be a different thing.

**00:14:54** God, which is the worst.

**00:14:56** I hate this.

**00:14:57** I hate this.

**00:14:58** I know.

**00:14:59** It has become much more manageable in my life since I've known you, right?

**00:15:02** But I still, it's just so much of a pain.

**00:15:05** Yeah.

**00:15:06** And like, I know that this is a thing that we talk about on the show all the time, but

**00:15:10** it really is like, it's such a problem when your whole life revolves around making things

**00:15:16** on computers and iPads and what, like what are the input devices?

**00:15:21** And I've said it before, but I always think of this science fiction story of like, oh,

**00:15:25** these poor creatures that are made of sand and they have to be very careful about what

**00:15:28** they're eroding away.

**00:15:30** And that's what it is, like cycling between these different devices.

**00:15:33** It's like, well, am I eroding away the joints in my arm or the joints in my wrist?

**00:15:38** Like I have to pick one.

**00:15:40** And the question is just cycle evenly between them to have the maximum amount of career

**00:15:45** that you possibly can.

**00:15:47** But yeah, so when you talk about that vertical one, I know people who love and live by vertical

**00:15:53** mice and I ages ago did used to use one, but that one and my current desk set up, I decided

**00:16:00** just not to use it.

**00:16:02** But with my right hand, I mainly alternate between the MX master three, which is like

**00:16:07** a traditional mouse that's sculpted to fit your hand.

**00:16:11** And I've always been a big, big proponent of the trackball mice and Logitech, maybe

**00:16:16** two years ago, updated their very, very old trackball design.

**00:16:21** And I love it.

**00:16:22** Like, I think that thing is great.

**00:16:24** And that's always the device that I travel with.

**00:16:26** Okay.

**00:16:27** Yeah, I've seen you use that.

**00:16:28** I think I saw you use it.

**00:16:30** My bachelor party.

**00:16:31** I think I stumbled upon you one day.

**00:16:33** You were using it, which was a funny thing for me to see.

**00:16:37** Yeah.

**00:16:38** And there's also an insight into how exciting my bachelor party is.

**00:16:41** Hey, what's that?

**00:16:42** What's that input device?

**00:16:43** My bachelor party was great for the people that were there.

**00:16:47** Let me tell you, I wouldn't have wanted it any other way.

**00:16:50** My brothers didn't get it, but everybody else had a great time.

**00:16:53** Like, we all, we were just a big, nerdy bachelor party.

**00:16:57** Yeah.

**00:16:58** And I think your brothers got a view into what is Mike's life and friends like.

**00:17:03** Yeah, they had to have, and they did kind of have their own bachelor party in the evenings.

**00:17:08** And we just all went to bed.

**00:17:10** This MX-Merk Ergo, have you used it of an iPad or have you tried?

**00:17:15** The trackball one?

**00:17:16** Yeah.

**00:17:17** Yeah.

**00:17:18** And it works.

**00:17:19** That is actually when I was telling you last time about, oh, I tried it with the mouse.

**00:17:21** That was actually the device that I was using, was using the Ergo.

**00:17:24** And I like it a lot.

**00:17:25** So this one doesn't move.

**00:17:27** Like you put it down and it stays where it is, right?

**00:17:29** And then you move the trackball.

**00:17:31** That's how it works.

**00:17:32** Yes.

**00:17:33** So in the decision of what am I eroding away?

**00:17:38** This is the device that allows you to focus solely on eroding away your thumb joints.

**00:17:43** So the reason I like to switch with that one is it completely takes your wrist out of the

**00:17:50** whole situation.

**00:17:51** And the reason I travel with it is because it is by far and away the best device to use

**00:17:56** if you're in cramped quarters.

**00:17:58** So if you're on an airplane or if you don't know what the hotel desk is going to be like,

**00:18:04** you want a trackball because you don't have to move your hand.

**00:18:07** I hadn't thought of that before.

**00:18:08** You could put it anywhere, right?

**00:18:10** So one of the things I do on flights is I will often have it on my lap.

**00:18:15** Like I won't even try to put it on the tray table.

**00:18:18** You just have it on your lap and you can use it that way.

**00:18:20** So I highly recommend to anybody.

**00:18:22** 22 pounds off on Amazon right now.

**00:18:25** Oh, great.

**00:18:26** There you go.

**00:18:27** Perfect.

**00:18:28** Pick one up.

**00:18:29** Yeah.

**00:18:30** Anyone who travels a lot, you should seriously consider using a trackball as an input device

**00:18:33** when you're traveling.

**00:18:34** It's a little weird to get used to it first.

**00:18:36** In the same way that ages ago, we talked about how pen tablets are a little weird to get

**00:18:40** used to at first.

**00:18:41** But once you adapt to it, you'll really like it as an alternate pointing device.

**00:18:47** Obviously lots of people are working from home at the moment.

**00:18:50** This is the thing that is becoming a thing.

**00:18:52** If we can give you one piece of advice about your working from home life, this is it.

**00:18:57** It's really watching the input devices that you're using and being very careful of posture

**00:19:03** because office environments, they are built to try and give you good posture because your

**00:19:08** bosses do not want you to ever have any kind of injury that could stop you from producing

**00:19:15** the work that they need.

**00:19:18** I could get when I was working at the bank, any type of ergonomic support I needed, they

**00:19:23** would just provide it.

**00:19:25** They had assessments and all that kind of stuff.

**00:19:27** That was like a thing.

**00:19:29** Please be careful of your posture and consider moving around.

**00:19:33** If you start getting pains in your hands or wrists, then think about different input devices

**00:19:37** because I bet a lot of people are working from laptops where they're used to working

**00:19:40** at desktops.

**00:19:41** I bet that's the thing that's happening right now.

**00:19:44** Yeah, for sure.

**00:19:45** I agree.

**00:19:46** That's definitely a work at home tip.

**00:19:48** I'm going to add to the other one, which is I know that your mega studio has some progress,

**00:19:57** which I'm very interested to hear.

**00:19:58** I was, again, 10, 14 days ago, very excited because I finally had found someone who was

**00:20:04** going to take me around to a few office options locally.

**00:20:07** Then I thought, okay, thank God.

**00:20:09** I'm going to be able to get an office out of my house.

**00:20:11** Then I was like, oh, I need to cancel this because of coronavirus.

**00:20:16** You know when I don't want to be touring a whole bunch of office buildings and then immediately

**00:20:20** moving into dense office buildings right now?

**00:20:23** I was like, nope, canceled.

**00:20:25** My other main tip for, okay, the gray household is in quarantine.

**00:20:29** I have to hunker down for a while is even in small spaces, I'm very, very insistent

**00:20:36** on always trying to divide up.

**00:20:38** If you have different kinds of work, do them in different places.

**00:20:43** While I've been working at home, I caught myself being a little bit lazy about sometimes

**00:20:47** doing administrative work on my main, the main iMac computer that I have that I'm recording

**00:20:53** with you right now.

**00:20:54** I was like, oh, sometimes I'll do email on this machine.

**00:20:57** I'm like, no, no, no.

**00:20:58** Confine all administrative communication work to one laptop.

**00:21:03** I'm just going to sit at the kitchen table when I do administration work and to create

**00:21:08** that real little division of productive work versus logistic and administrative work.

**00:21:15** Now I'm being super serious since I know that I'm working at home into making sure that

**00:21:21** I keep those two spaces clean and clear into what they're used for.

**00:21:26** And I think that stuff just helps if you're in the same environment over a long period

**00:21:30** of time, like define little areas and have specific activities for those areas.

**00:22:38** Our thanks to Indeed for their support of this show and all of Relay FM.

**00:22:42** While we are in the coronavirus portion of the show, I want to talk about the journals.

**00:22:47** Oh yes.

**00:22:48** How are the journals doing?

**00:22:49** Well, I have to.

**00:22:50** I didn't, I don't want to talk about this because it's sad to me, but I have to address

**00:22:54** it because it's important.

**00:22:56** So we had been working on having journals for sale again in late March, early April

**00:23:03** to allow people who had, who have been using the system to make sure they had their new

**00:23:07** book for a new quarter.

**00:23:09** We got our order in before lunar new year.

**00:23:11** We are now of course dealing with coronavirus.

**00:23:14** We were supposed to have them in time.

**00:23:15** The order was placed because I've learned from the year previous, right?

**00:23:19** That like everything shuts down.

**00:23:21** But if you've been following this, right, coronavirus hit China during lunar new year.

**00:23:27** So they extended it and then, you know, China was first and they had been dealing with it

**00:23:31** and they're starting, it seems like they're starting to come out of it.

**00:23:35** But coronavirus is affecting manufacturing.

**00:23:38** I actually want to put in the show notes a video from Linus Tech Tips where Linus has

**00:23:42** a really good kind of overview of the knock on effects that can happen due to these types

**00:23:48** of things in manufacturing.

**00:23:50** And obviously he's mainly talking about computer parts, but this affects all manufacture.

**00:23:56** So I just want to put that in there.

**00:23:57** I find it very interesting to kind of see how these types of issues can affect manufacture.

**00:24:03** Is he talking about like the just in time manufacturing kind of stuff?

**00:24:06** It's just in time, but also just like regular manufacture of like, you can be ready.

**00:24:10** You can have a stockpile of stuff, but then there is problems about moving it.

**00:24:15** Yeah.

**00:24:16** So you may not be in just in time manufacturing.

**00:24:18** You may be in a manufacturing process where you have warehouses full of stuff, but now

**00:24:24** the trucks can't move it.

**00:24:25** So it doesn't matter how much stuff you have if it can't be taken to the port.

**00:24:30** Yeah.

**00:24:32** I find it kind of endlessly fascinating modern supply chain logistics.

**00:24:36** And it's because it is this weird combination of breathtakingly efficient, but also terrifyingly

**00:24:45** fragile.

**00:24:46** It is a very incredibly well-made house of cards.

**00:24:48** Yeah.

**00:24:49** But a house of cards still is.

**00:24:51** Yeah, that's a good way to put it.

**00:24:54** And it's like, oh, hey, guess what?

**00:24:56** If Chinese factories shut down for two weeks, you know, that's not the same kind of thing

**00:25:02** like, oh, you got two weeks of snow days at your school.

**00:25:06** Like, oh, yeah, there's disruption, but it's localized and contained.

**00:25:09** It's like, no, no, no, that will ripple out for a year.

**00:25:14** Yeah.

**00:25:15** So as it stands right now, the most recent update we have had from our manufacturer is

**00:25:20** that the notebooks will be completed on April 5th, but these timelines are incredibly hard

**00:25:25** to predict.

**00:25:26** That's what they have given to us.

**00:25:28** They are working, we've been told, and we're going to get an update at the end of March.

**00:25:33** And then we're going to move from there.

**00:25:35** But even if they were ready on April 5th, which I don't think will be the day, I think

**00:25:39** it will slip into sometime in April, later in April.

**00:25:43** This is just when the books are made.

**00:25:44** We still need to then have samples sent and we know what happened last time with the samples.

**00:25:49** So just fall out of a box somewhere and then they have to be shipped.

**00:25:52** So honestly, I don't know when we're going to have journals back in stock.

**00:25:57** And all I can do is apologize.

**00:26:00** Like, I'm sorry.

**00:26:01** And it's causing me great anxiety because, you know, I know there are a lot of people

**00:26:05** that have built into this idea because they believe in it like we do.

**00:26:10** And it just makes me, I feel so upset about the fact that we can't provide people with

**00:26:17** the notebooks if they want them or need them.

**00:26:20** Yeah, yeah, it is a real bummer because we are in that position of people who really

**00:26:25** like it, you know, want to get the next one if they're using it every day.

**00:26:30** And it's like, oh, we're coming up against that deadline, but we're just not going to

**00:26:33** be able to do that.

**00:26:35** So I take solace in the idea that our system is simple enough that somebody could, you

**00:26:39** know, once they're into it, they could draw it out for themselves in a notebook.

**00:26:42** But I hope that you will then still buy another one later down the line.

**00:26:48** Yeah, like you can you can have like a makeshift quarantine notebook to get you through this

**00:26:53** difficult time.

**00:26:54** But yeah, yeah, for those of you keeping score at home, what can delay a physical product?

**00:27:01** We have been through many things and now you can add pandemic to that list.

**00:27:07** I hadn't realized that until you just said it.

**00:27:10** Like, this was supposed to be the one where it's like, OK, we've experienced everything now.

**00:27:16** Right. Yeah. Yeah.

**00:27:17** So we can plan. Right. So I had planned everything into this like lead time wise.

**00:27:22** We were very confident last time we spoke about it.

**00:27:26** Like, oh, we've been through a bunch of orders.

**00:27:28** What else could happen?

**00:27:29** Yeah, what else could happen?

**00:27:31** Pandemic can happen.

**00:27:32** So, yeah, obviously, it doesn't need to be said.

**00:27:35** But, you know, we most first and foremost just want everybody who is involved in our

**00:27:40** notebooks to be safe.

**00:27:42** Right. Like that is what we care about most.

**00:27:44** And that's why we are just taking this on the chin.

**00:27:48** But it still brings me.

**00:27:52** Great anxiety and sadness.

**00:27:54** Right. We can't continue the way that we want.

**00:27:57** But things are still moving ahead.

**00:27:59** There will be books at some point.

**00:28:01** We are still moving ahead with version two.

**00:28:03** The design of version two is now finished and we're currently getting quotes for that.

**00:28:07** So my hope will be by the end of the year.

**00:28:11** We will have a slightly revised version two.

**00:28:13** And that's when the big order will come.

**00:28:15** But who knows what's going to happen now?

**00:28:16** Like, it's all very up in the air, but.

**00:28:21** Bear with us, I guess.

**00:28:23** All right. So sad things.

**00:28:25** Happy things. How is Mega Studio progressing?

**00:28:28** Well, I mean, how can a studio progress when you're quarantined?

**00:28:31** Well, OK. So you're not going to Mega Studio.

**00:28:35** Are you are you joining the ranks of everyone working at home?

**00:28:38** Like, what's what's the what's the deal here?

**00:28:40** Because I thought stuff was still happening with with Mega Studio.

**00:28:42** Well, I have what? Yes and no.

**00:28:44** So like I have been in self isolation for the last couple of weeks.

**00:28:49** OK. But it's worked out fine anyway, because we haven't really needed to be at the studio.

**00:28:53** So I kind of took this as a time to do it.

**00:28:55** OK. But we are going to be back in the studio next week because we have a lot of deliveries coming.

**00:29:01** This is mostly all to do with soundproofing and trying to get the audio environment right.

**00:29:07** And it's it has been an ordeal over the last couple of weeks.

**00:29:10** So I started to notice these loud dings coming from the pipes

**00:29:17** in the room, and we had a contractor come out and look at it.

**00:29:20** And it's basically like, well, that's just what these radiators are going to do.

**00:29:23** So it's like, OK, so it's like thermal expansion and contraction kind of stuff.

**00:29:27** Yeah. Or there's like like sediment in the pipes.

**00:29:31** Ah, oh, OK. Right.

**00:29:34** Just because it's like an old system. Right.

**00:29:36** So there's rocks moving around in there.

**00:29:39** Probably. And like, yeah, there is a thing you can do for this,

**00:29:42** which is to run this like sludge through.

**00:29:45** But we would need to do that on the entire building, which is not going to happen.

**00:29:51** We need to roll that one out.

**00:29:52** There is no way we're going to be able to convince the owner of the building to do this work.

**00:29:58** And neither would I even bother because it's not important to anyone else except us.

**00:30:04** All right. So it's like, fine, whatever.

**00:30:06** We'll find another way of doing it.

**00:30:07** And so we're just going to get like some foam insulation to put around the pipes,

**00:30:10** like actual pipe insulation.

**00:30:12** It will dampen it a little bit.

**00:30:14** And that's kind of all I need.

**00:30:16** I've been doing audio tests and with a little bit of dampening, it won't be a problem.

**00:30:21** OK, good. Plus the more that we have spent in the office,

**00:30:24** we're like realizing that it is around like temperature changes.

**00:30:28** So just being smart about when the heating is on and off in the office

**00:30:32** and how we heat the office will allow us to reduce that a little bit.

**00:30:36** But the soundproofing thing has just been it's and it's so difficult.

**00:30:41** Idina has been researching all of this.

**00:30:43** And so really, like there's two things going on here for me.

**00:30:48** One, I do not want to build any structures.

**00:30:52** All right. Like I think I said this before,

**00:30:53** but I am not interested in building a room inside of the room.

**00:30:56** Right. You don't want a recording booth.

**00:30:57** I do not want a booth because I don't want to install anything into the studio

**00:31:03** that cannot be easily taken with us whenever we move studio.

**00:31:06** In the future.

**00:31:07** And I feel like a structure is built within the constraints of the room that it is in.

**00:31:14** And that won't be the same if we move. Right.

**00:31:19** And and I also can't imagine that a room that is built is as easy to break down

**00:31:25** as you have some panels, you have some blankets, you have some foam on the walls.

**00:31:30** Right. That stuff is more movable, more adjustable.

**00:31:34** Yeah. I mean, I get it that you don't want to build a structure inside the office.

**00:31:39** I get it because it's not easy to take with you.

**00:31:42** I mean, my thought is, Mike, all of your work depends on high quality.

**00:31:47** OK, OK, OK. So so you are doing what the Reddit is doing.

**00:31:51** So allow me to finish my thought process.

**00:31:53** No, no, no, no. But like, no, let me let me finish it for you.

**00:31:56** Right. Which is just like I can I can see it.

**00:31:59** But I think the better argument is because you record so many shows,

**00:32:03** you don't want to spend all day in a box. All right.

**00:32:06** Like that's that's not good.

**00:32:07** Sorry. Yes. Thank you.

**00:32:08** You weren't going where I thought you were going to go.

**00:32:10** That is it. I do not want to spend my time in what I feel like will be a sound coffin.

**00:32:16** That's how I'm thinking about it.

**00:32:17** Because I've seen yours. Right.

**00:32:19** And I don't want to be inside of this like black box that you sit.

**00:32:25** So it is like plan D. Right.

**00:32:29** Yeah. The black model, the black monolith in my office, which even I disassembled

**00:32:34** because of being in this office long term of like, it doesn't make sense if I'm here

**00:32:39** for a lot of time. I didn't know that.

**00:32:40** OK. Yeah. Yeah.

**00:32:42** It's I've I've disassembled it. OK. So for the listeners, I have my home office is this

**00:32:49** little rectangular room. And the thing that I've referred to as the black monolith in the past is

**00:32:55** I took the back 40 percent of the room and built like a completely self-contained sound

**00:33:02** proofing cube to do the podcast recording in. But yeah, several months ago, around the time

**00:33:07** I got my standing desk, when I knew like, oh, I'm going to be in this home office a lot,

**00:33:12** I disassembled it and kind of spread the parts all around the room.

**00:33:16** Right. So you turned the booth into sound isolation, which is really all you needed in

**00:33:20** that room. Like you just needed some panels on the walls. But I understand you went a bit

**00:33:25** overkill, but that's fine. Yeah, it yeah, it does. It's it's less good this way, but it's fine.

**00:33:30** Right. This this is the thing of like, it's totally fine. I would have kept the booth

**00:33:34** because if I had an additional space, but if I have to make decisions about the space,

**00:33:38** like it's that's a very different kind of decision. But for me, because I record podcasts so rarely,

**00:33:45** that structure totally made sense. But as you've seen in person, people would go into that booth

**00:33:52** and they would just go, oh, oh, no, like I don't want to be in this space.

**00:33:56** I hate it in there. There's something about real like sound, really good soundproof rooms.

**00:34:03** Yeah. That feel very uncomfortable to be in.

**00:34:06** Yeah. Yeah. It's often like people usually describe it as like a pressure on the ears

**00:34:11** or when people talk, they're uncomfortable because they're just not getting the feedback

**00:34:16** they're used to hearing from their own voice. And so even just my office, if you weren't in the

**00:34:23** booth, people didn't like being in the office because there was too much sound absorption

**00:34:28** in the space. And so it makes sense. It made sense for me, like, because I was doing so

**00:34:35** much less audio than you, but I'm with you on this. Like you do not want to spend with the

**00:34:40** number of shows that you do a significant amount of time in a sound coffin. Like that's,

**00:34:46** that's brutal. And if you have to live with pipe dings, I fully support that. And all the audio

**00:34:51** files who want their perfect wave files with no, with no reduction in sound quality and no dings,

**00:35:00** they're going to have to accept the like, oh, maybe there's a tiny bit of echo

**00:35:04** because Mike has to keep his sanity while recording all of these shows.

**00:35:08** But that is plan D, right? Like if, if I can't do this, then I will have to get something.

**00:35:16** Plan E is hiring a professional because it is incredibly expensive. Right? Like I don't,

**00:35:23** I don't want to do it. It's incredibly expensive. We are currently working on plan B first. Okay.

**00:35:32** So plan B is get some stuff that can provide an environment that will work, but is not going to

**00:35:39** be the permanent solution. So I'd been doing so much research and we found some products and

**00:35:46** there's kind of all arriving over the next week. And this includes these, I think I've mentioned

**00:35:52** these before, like there are these like panels that will go behind me, like they're freestanding.

**00:35:56** And they, they are sound isolating. Like they, they have stuff inside them. I don't know what it is,

**00:36:01** but like whatever research. And, but they are mainly so I have something behind me because I don't

**00:36:09** want to record with an open area behind me. Like I want, if anybody approaches me, I want to be able

**00:36:14** to see them from the sides, not from behind. Right. I just don't like that. Then we found these

**00:36:20** soundproofing blankets and they're very heavy. It's like a five kilogram blanket.

**00:36:27** They're massive. And we bought one of them and I draped it over me and it was,

**00:36:32** it completely removed the echo. Okay. Just to be clear here, is this a blanket that you could

**00:36:39** cozy up on the couch with in your relaxation area or is this, I wouldn't recommend it because it is,

**00:36:46** it's not like a weighted blanket. Like that's what I'm wondering. It is a blanket, which is heavy,

**00:36:52** but it is made by a soundproofing company. Like I have sound blankets. Yeah, I know. Right. I've

**00:36:59** never heard of such a thing until I've never, I can't believe I haven't come across something like

**00:37:03** this. So let me find sound blankets, heavy duty sound absorbing blankets. Yeah, they exist.

**00:37:10** Currently unavailable. Uh, last one purchased by Mike is what Amazon says. Oh,

**00:37:15** no, no, no, not Amazon. Not Amazon. This is the company that we used. I'll put this in the show

**00:37:21** notes so people can find it. I'm just, I'm very curious. Like I feel like I too have spent a

**00:37:25** million hours looking at all the various soundproofing options and this is a new thing. I've just never

**00:37:29** come across. I couldn't find it. Idina found it. She's very good at research, right? Like this is

**00:37:33** something that she came across. And so we ordered, you'll see them as the VB 76G black on one side,

**00:37:40** white on the other so that I will be looking at the white side, which I feel would be nicer for me.

**00:37:45** So the plan right now is two of these blankets on stands on either side of me,

**00:37:52** the soundproofing panel behind, and then possibly we're going to like build like we have that foam,

**00:38:00** right? We're just going to build like a foam roof to go on top of it. Right. Okay. And then we have

**00:38:08** good sound panels that are going to go on the wall behind the desk. And from the testing that we have

**00:38:14** done with these elements individually, I think a combination of all of this will provide us with a

**00:38:21** good enough for now solution. Right. Right. So then we can actually be in the studio. I can record in

**00:38:29** the studio and then we will be slowly building plan a, which is more of these panels on the walls,

**00:38:38** putting some bass traps in, which are like these phone things that go in the corners.

**00:38:42** And then maybe over my desk, eventually hanging something to stop the echo going into the ceiling.

**00:38:50** All of that is more difficult, more expensive. And all of the stuff that we're buying,

**00:38:55** we could use for other stuff. So like if I wanted to record video in the space,

**00:39:01** I would then have these blankets that could be placed behind cameras on the stands that we're

**00:39:06** buying and provide different sound isolation. It can be more moved around. Right. Oh, that's

**00:39:11** interesting. What are you up to there with video? Mike, what are you doing? What little Mikey plans

**00:39:16** do you have? I have recently had the feeling again, a video. I was like, are you getting back into

**00:39:23** vlogging? I always really enjoyed your vlogs and I was sad when you stopped. I don't want to do

**00:39:27** vlogs. I don't want to be a vlogger, but there is, I've just had a feeling again of like, I'm just

**00:39:35** just the point is just like with all this space, right, I have more flexibility again. And it might

**00:39:42** allow for more technology focused videos to be produced potentially. But my point is just like,

**00:39:49** I want to buy stuff now that can be used in the future. Like I don't want to buy things that will

**00:39:56** just only be used for that one purpose. So that's the plan. And that is plan B with plan A of like,

**00:40:03** as we are continuing to fill the studio up, then finding more panels to go in the areas where

**00:40:10** they're still echo because like, we still are missing most of our soft furnishings. We're

**00:40:15** basically going to buy a massive rug. A friend of the show, Jason Snow recommended to me or gave me

**00:40:21** the phrase carpet remnant. Have you ever heard of this before? No. So there's there are companies

**00:40:26** that take large offcuts of carpets that we use in other places and can make them into rugs for you.

**00:40:32** Huh? Okay, you can get massive rugs cheaply. We have our little rugs that we like for the

**00:40:38** areas, but like for all of the concrete floor, just a massive rug, which is effectively a carpet,

**00:40:44** but you can get for way cheaper. So we're looking into that. There's still a lot of stuff to be done,

**00:40:49** but I'm kind of fed up now of not being able to use this studio for its purpose. Right? I've paid

**00:40:55** one and a half rent payments now and have not been there. Right? Yeah. Now, of course, there is this

**00:41:00** other problem of like the self isolation, but our main thing is just we just got to get to the studio

**00:41:07** and then it's basically just like being at home because nobody else comes in. Yeah. Yeah. I think

**00:41:11** from the impression I've gotten about the physical setup of the office and your entry there, you can

**00:41:18** much more easily than I could, you could maintain a quarantine bubble that basically extends into

**00:41:24** that office and back. Yeah. So yeah, it can be very in the studio. We don't have to leave it. We're

**00:41:30** just going to get to it. So, you know, and so we're going to we're going to be spending a bit

**00:41:34** more time there again next week when things start arriving and we can start getting it more set up

**00:41:40** again. I have been on an absolute emotional roller coaster over the last month of like,

**00:41:47** oh crap, we can't do this to. Oh, actually, I think we can. What do you mean? What do you mean?

**00:41:53** You can't do this. Like you can't set up the office. What is it? Like I'm never going to get

**00:41:57** this place non-echoing. Like you cannot do this without spending tens of thousands of pounds.

**00:42:05** Yeah. Right. Like that is I've been going on this emotional roller coaster, but luckily we are now

**00:42:10** a point where I feel like it's never going to be perfect, but it's going to be more than sufficient.

**00:42:19** Yeah. And I think that's just a side effect of you bring in the one sound isolating thing and you

**00:42:24** think, oh, this hasn't made any difference at all. But the whole game of trying to reduce sound is

**00:42:30** lots of things. And I can see why maybe you would be upset. You're like, oh, this blanket isn't

**00:42:35** doing anything unless I wrap it around my head. It was like, but yes, it's just another thing in

**00:42:39** the room plus the carpet plus the soft furnishings. Like, yeah, you're going to get there. You'll be

**00:42:42** fine. I think we are. I feel like now I feel confident that we're going to get there, but it

**00:42:47** was just like I was doing all these things and it was making no difference, like at all. But then

**00:42:53** when we found this blanket, like, again, draping over me in a way that I wouldn't want to work,

**00:42:59** but it made a it was the first thing that made a noticeable difference. You might not want to work

**00:43:05** that way, but I'm going to forever imagine that you are wrapped in a blanket for cozy sound. Yeah.

**00:43:11** Can a cozy sound isolating blanket for it when I know that you're recording in the mega studio.

**00:43:16** That's just how I'm going to picture it. But yeah, so I feel like now like there is

**00:43:20** a path again, which is good. So by not the next time we record, but in a couple of episodes time,

**00:43:31** maybe in April will be the first cortex from mega studio. Oh, exciting. Yeah. So we'll see.

**00:45:20** them. I'm very excited about this. Okay. I need to know. Okay. So for listeners who want to wear

**00:45:27** VESA arms are the little arms that can hold up computer monitors. Yeah. So yeah. If you're in

**00:45:33** an office environment, you'll often see that they don't use the regular stands that the computers

**00:45:37** come with. They're attached to an arm that can move the screen around. So I've tried various

**00:45:44** VESA arms, but I feel like I have never found one that I like that hits the nice balance between.

**00:45:52** You can move the monitor and also the monitor will stay in position when you stop touching it

**00:45:59** and it won't slowly droop like a sad flower in the sunlight. I can't tell you that I found that yet

**00:46:05** because I don't have a monitor on any of the arms. Okay. Well, okay. But then that might be

**00:46:11** what you're going to experience in the future. So the arms that I have, it's one arm and then

**00:46:17** the other arm has a laptop stand on it. Right. Yes. Yes. And I've been putting laptops and

**00:46:23** iPads on them and they've been perfectly fine. They're very adjustable. Yeah. The laptop stuff

**00:46:27** has always been fine. I just, my experience has been like, I tried to mount my iMac pro on a VESA

**00:46:33** arm and, and eventually came to the conclusion of I didn't want to live life on the edge like this

**00:46:38** because it's like this really expensive computer. And I just never found an arm that felt secure

**00:46:46** or was mobile enough. So I, I, yeah, well, we'll find out. Like I know people that do it like it

**00:46:52** is possible. Yeah. And so the arms that I have, they are very, they feel very sturdy. And so we'll

**00:46:58** see, right? Like I will report back on that one. Please do. Once we're moving to the studio,

**00:47:04** like actually moved in, I'm going to be putting my iMac on that arm. But also in the meantime,

**00:47:09** so when I'm recording, I am going to, at some point, I think liberate your LG 5K ultra-fun

**00:47:15** that you've been trying to palm off on me for a while. Well, well, if we can make a drop,

**00:47:21** I don't know how we're going to do it. So here's, here's the thing. I've been living with the burden

**00:47:26** of this monitor for so long and try and like standing out in the streets going, hey, LG 5K,

**00:47:32** LG 5K, anybody want it? Perfect. Good working condition. And everyone's like, no, those monitors

**00:47:36** are gross. We all know that no one's going to take them. And finally, Mike, you messaged me and I was

**00:47:41** like, Hey, do you still have that 5K LG monitor? Like I do, boy, do I have it for you? And then

**00:47:52** the gray household went into total quarantine. And I'm not exactly sure how we're going to transfer

**00:47:56** this because I will not see you in person. Like maybe I can leave it on a street corner and you

**00:48:04** can do a drive by and pick it up really quick or something. But yeah, yeah, we will need to figure

**00:48:10** out a system for how the monitor will actually get transferred. Yeah. But that at some point,

**00:48:15** I will be liberating that monitor for me. Yeah. And I will be so happy to know that you're getting

**00:48:21** getting use out of it, that it's found a good home.

**00:48:24** Yeah, it will be, you know, I'm going to need monitors. Like I need a monitor on my recording

**00:48:29** desk and then he don't monitor on the hot desk that I'm going to be setting up to. So it will

**00:48:34** find a home. Even if I end up not liking it, it will still find a home.

**00:48:38** Yeah. And it's perfect for that kind of thing. Like you need some monitors.

**00:48:41** Where can you get some monitors? Gray's got a monitor for you.

**00:48:44** Yeah. So I might as well take it like it's needed and you're not using it. And finally,

**00:48:48** we can get to tie a bow on this long standing. So I will take it from you.

**00:48:54** Yeah. It feels like the conclusion of an epic story arc somehow.

**00:48:58** It's super difficult to try and work out what a desk needs when you're not actually working on

**00:49:03** the desk. Yeah. Right. So like I've been trying to work out a home. Like what is each desk going

**00:49:08** to need? Because just to recap, like I will have two desks. I will have my desk where I record and

**00:49:13** then my desk where I do my editing and all my other work. So it's going to be set up for both

**00:49:18** an iPad and iMac Pro. So like there will be two setups there. I do like the idea of you sitting

**00:49:24** on the couch at home, fantasizing about mega studio and making little drawings about,

**00:49:30** oh, which desk is going to go there? I've been mind mapping. Oh yeah.

**00:49:34** That's the way that it made sense to me. So like I have each desk and then each piece of equipment

**00:49:39** and what each piece of equipment needs from it. Like I've been trying to mind map that out.

**00:49:44** I still found it incredibly difficult to actually work out what pieces of equipment I'm

**00:49:48** again, they need to purchase, but that's fine because I have enough mobile gear that I can

**00:49:55** Jerry rig everything together until I work out what like fixed gear I'm going to need

**00:50:02** desk. Because as we have established mobile gear, fixed gear, different, but also the same. Yeah.

**00:50:10** Sure. Different, but the same. So yeah, that I'm still working that out, but like I'm, I am

**00:50:16** so excited to be able to actually get the desks out. I have the desks and they're amazing. I'm

**00:50:22** so happy with my desk. Great. I have two desks. One is absolutely massive and one is like regular

**00:50:29** size small. Are they standing desks? Both standing desks. Yep. Oh, very exciting. Yeah. I just figured

**00:50:35** that. Well, it's just the same as the desk I have here. I want to have the flexibility

**00:50:40** in the desk that I was looking at. There wasn't like a wild price difference between having

**00:50:45** standing and not standing. And it's, I've really come around to, especially when looking at stuff

**00:50:50** in the studio and I've been trying to instill this idea into Adina. She's been helping me plan

**00:50:54** all this stuff out. I don't want to buy lots of things many times. I want to spend a little bit

**00:51:01** more money and buy it once. Yep. That makes sense. I've learned this over time, which is just like

**00:51:07** you can try and save money, but you eventually end up replacing. You know, one thing that I've

**00:51:14** really learned this in is chairs. So I use Herman Miller chairs now. I use the M body chair after

**00:51:21** being recommended to me by everybody that I know, basically. And because I had prior to buying one

**00:51:28** of these chairs, maybe three years ago, I had gone through like two or three chairs from Amazon

**00:51:33** that were between 150 and 200 pounds each. You know, like something broke on them, something

**00:51:38** stopped working. But these Herman Miller chairs, they cost like 900 or a thousand pounds, but they

**00:51:43** come with a 10 year warranty. So what I learned is I was spending 150 to 200 pounds basically

**00:51:50** every year buying a new chair because something would fail on my chair. So now I extrapolated

**00:51:55** that out. I spend 900 pounds on a chair, but I get it guaranteed for 10 years. Yeah. So, you know,

**00:52:02** this is kind of like a thing that I've learned now that like my business is a place where I can

**00:52:08** afford these things, which I treat as assets. Now, the things my company owns, right? Just actually

**00:52:13** just buy them once rather than buying like three desks. Like, so I have an IKEA desk here, right?

**00:52:19** The IKEA desk that I bought was cheaper than the desks I'm buying now. But the

**00:52:24** standard mechanism was broken. Right. Yeah. So now I am, again, spending more money on a desk

**00:52:31** that has a guarantee on it and that is better made. So that's kind of the route that I'm going down.

**00:52:39** Yeah. Yeah. And this is also this big difference between, and I think it's tricky for a lot of

**00:52:47** people when you become self-employed or you start to run your own business of

**00:52:52** having to shift the way you think about spending money on purchases. And it can be very hard to do,

**00:53:00** but this is a really important part of this. And, you know, on top of just the straight up financial

**00:53:07** calculation, there's also, I mean, I think the listeners can hear that setting up your office is

**00:53:13** a big deal. Like it's a big project that's going to take a long time. And what you don't want is

**00:53:19** to get a bunch of equipment in there, which then, because you have a lot of things, like each part

**00:53:27** might slowly need to be replaced. Like you want to do this once and never have to think about it

**00:53:33** again. Yeah. The initial set up that I'm doing here, which has taken way longer than I want it to

**00:53:39** is this should be the set up that lasts me another 10 years. So even if we move office,

**00:53:45** we move like you move your home, right? We're not going to start again with new desks and new chairs

**00:53:50** and all that stuff. Yeah. Yeah. So it makes sense to, it makes sense to get stuff that's going to

**00:53:55** last at this point and, and to not in two years have to redo one of the desk set ups because that

**00:54:02** desk was flaky or it's bending or it's wobbling and it doesn't work anymore. It's like, no, no,

**00:54:07** that's not the way to handle this. Like this, this is, you have an office like for all of the company

**00:54:13** work that you do, like set it up, set it up properly and, and do it right the first time as best you can.

**00:54:20** So the desks that I bought, uh, these desks goes to Jarvis desk and I bought them from a company

**00:54:26** called fully who is going to be a sponsor on other shows that I do. And I had never heard of them,

**00:54:33** but then as soon as I found them, I then bought two desks with my own money from this company.

**00:54:38** Right. So like, I just want to make that all very clear, right? Like they haven't,

**00:54:41** we haven't actually done any sponsorship stuff with them yet, right? But I found this company

**00:54:46** at just the right time and bought two desks from them out of my own money. Because what I really

**00:54:50** liked is the Jarvis frame. I've heard lots of good things about in the past. Like this isn't

**00:54:56** their frame. They sell this frame, but then also make their own desktops. Right. And what I liked

**00:55:03** is the desks are very customizable. Oh, I, you know, it's funny. I came across when I was looking

**00:55:08** for my standing desk, I came across this company because I liked their, um, this thing here that

**00:55:15** they have this little like jigsaw, my first standing desk for kids, which I think is adorable.

**00:55:20** Oh my God. I've not seen this way. Where is this?

**00:55:24** Mike, how did you not know about the standing desk for children?

**00:55:26** I have never heard of this.

**00:55:29** I'll send it to you. Oh my God. This is amazing. Right. Isn't it? It's adorable.

**00:55:33** It's called the jazz wig. It's not jigsaw. Oh, sorry. I must've been looking at the wrong thing.

**00:55:38** No, no, I think it's meant to trick you because it's all the same.

**00:55:41** Oh, I see. Right. Yeah, you're right. Yeah. Jazz wig. Yeah. But yeah, no standing desk

**00:55:45** for kids. I came across that. I can't remember whatever. Well anyway, like, uh, yeah, they were,

**00:55:51** they were one of the things that I was looking at. And also it is on my list to get from them.

**00:55:56** They have these kneeling chairs, which I totally forgot that a long time ago I used to use and

**00:56:02** really love and then kind of forgot about it. I've been looking at them, but thought that they

**00:56:06** would be horrible. I can say I've used them in, uh, college. Like I had one in my dorm room and

**00:56:18** it, it was interesting because, so I've, I've got like the same Herman Miller chair that you do,

**00:56:22** because it's the same Herman Miller chair that everybody has. And I like it, but one of the

**00:56:28** things I am aware of, it is a little too easy to start slouching sometimes and like slide down

**00:56:34** the chair a little bit. And it's been on my mind to, uh, have one of the kneeling chairs as an

**00:56:42** alternate because the thing that I really liked about it was that those chairs, it's very hard

**00:56:48** to slouch. Like they, they force you much more into a correct posture, which sounds like torture,

**00:56:55** but I'm, I mean it in a good way. Like it's, it's different chair. I've seen this different chair

**00:57:01** design popping up in places. And again, this company sells it. It's called the Capisco chair

**00:57:07** and it's like a super weird looking chair. Like it doesn't look like a regular chair, but like

**00:57:13** you look at the pictures of it and the thinking is that like it allows you to sit in a lot of

**00:57:19** different positions. Huh. I've been seeing this chair more and more recently. Uh, I, I don't know

**00:57:26** that looks very, that looks very weird to me. Yep. Isn't it? I feel significantly less sold on

**00:57:34** this idea as an idea for a chair that I would want. Yeah. I don't think I want it either,

**00:57:39** but like I've been seeing more and more people use it. That feels like a chair I would want to drive

**00:57:45** before buying. Yes. Yep. Like, like I need that to be in some co-working space where I am for a day.

**00:57:53** And you can just give it a go. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So I don't know about that. I don't know about that.

**00:57:57** Yeah. I'm not sure about that one either, but I say I've been seeing it more and more recently.

**00:58:01** Yeah. But I give my full thumbs up to kneeling chairs. So they have one called the balance

**00:58:08** kneeling chair. It actually looks like one that they make, but I don't know. Yeah. Yeah.

**00:58:13** It's on my mind as a thing to try, but, uh, yeah. So standing desks for children,

**00:58:17** which is adorable, uh, and kneeling chairs. And also this is Mike's current standing desk.

**00:58:25** What I like about it is that they, you can basically just make your own specification.

**00:58:30** So I'm, I have one, which is, I think the smallest that they make and then also the largest that they

**00:58:36** make. And the smallest one is the recording desk. And then the largest one is my regular desk.

**00:58:42** And it's massive. It's 180 centimeters by 80 centimeters. That's the big one.

**00:58:47** Oh, that's pretty big. Yes. Massive. It's great. That's nice to have though.

**00:58:53** Now you're like, you've got me distracted looking at office furniture. Yep. Like, Oh,

**00:58:57** do I need a stool? Maybe. No, not really. Maybe. But maybe I do. I don't know. Maybe,

**00:59:02** maybe that can go in my kitchen where I do my administrative work now and have a, have a stool.

**00:59:06** Would you get a kneeling chair with a back on it or no back on it?

**00:59:10** So the one I used had no back on it. And, um, see, when I look at those chairs,

**00:59:17** I just imagine myself falling off them. I feel like I would fall off it a lot.

**00:59:21** You think you're going to, but you don't try. Like, yeah, I get it.

**00:59:24** Is the falling offness, what keeps you from slouching?

**00:59:27** No, that's not.

**00:59:28** Because you're constantly scared you're going to fall off it.

**00:59:30** No, that's not, I'm trying to think of how to explain it. So

**00:59:34** the re the reason that the kneeling chair works is I feel like it puts you in a position where

**00:59:42** like your gravity is just going straight down because your legs are sort of underneath you.

**00:59:48** It feels very much like, Oh, I am a stable stack of bricks here, each one on top of the other. And

**00:59:54** they're all pushing down in the same direction. So you don't lean forward and you don't lean back.

**01:00:00** It's not because of a fear of falling, though. It is very weird to get into one for the first time.

**01:00:05** Because you're like, this is not chairs. This is not how chairs chairs. I don't like this at all.

**01:00:09** I don't know if I like the phrase, get into the chair. That doesn't make me feel good.

**01:00:15** Look, it's like, it's like getting on a horse, right? It's weird the first time.

**01:00:19** And you're like, why is it so high?

**01:00:21** Why do you keep talking about horses so much?

**01:00:25** Is this your new hobby? Are you horse riding now?

**01:00:28** Look, I'm just trying to throw out metaphors that you might be familiar with.

**01:00:32** You know I don't know how to ride a horse. I barely know how to ride a bike.

**01:00:39** Everybody knows how to ride a horse. That just seems like a thing everyone knows. But anyway,

**01:00:42** look, so you get into the chair and it is weird the first time and it takes a little

**01:00:46** while to get used to. But my feeling is it's very stable and it's very slouch resistant,

**01:00:54** which that's my one complaint with the chair that I have, which I do love.

**01:00:58** But I want the chair to be less forgiving of my slow ability to sit in a non-optimal position.

**01:01:06** So that's why the kneeling chairs have been on my mind.

**01:01:08** Anyway, try a kneeling chair. Get one for Mega Studio. It can be a fun talking point anyway.

**01:01:15** Yeah, I'll add it to my Apple note where I add like things that are inspiring to me, you know?

**01:01:21** Right. Good. Sounds good.

**01:01:23** Oh, I wanted to provide a piece of follow up for you about my internet.

**01:01:26** Okay.

**01:01:26** So I was super mad about it if you remember the price of everything.

**01:01:29** Yes, very expensive internet.

**01:01:31** The deposit, which I will never, I will never be happy about. And I had to pay it.

**01:01:37** And I was, I was so mad about it. Like just so mad. Especially because, right, you know,

**01:01:44** they say it's for the equipment. They didn't even need any equipment. The equipment was already in

**01:01:47** there. The engineer came and there was a box of equipment that was delivered. He's like,

**01:01:51** oh, I don't need any of this. It's already in there.

**01:01:52** Right. Yeah. No, of course.

**01:01:53** I'll just take it away for you. It's like, okay, there goes my deposit. I suppose.

**01:01:57** Right. I'm just here to take your deposit away.

**01:02:00** Yeah. Yeah. It's like, oh, you see that thing you paid all that money for? I'm just going to take

**01:02:04** that. Great. Thank you. Bye engineer. But gray, I said it was slow. My internet.

**01:02:10** I was wrong. My friend. Oh my God.

**01:02:13** Is this again where you're just, where you're just going to flex all over me about how fast

**01:02:16** your internet is. 900 up and down. God damn you.

**01:02:22** Up and down. God damn it.

**01:02:26** On wifi. That's my wifi speed.

**01:02:29** Very happy for you.

**01:02:30** Oh, I'm so happy.

**01:02:31** Let me run a speed test while we're recording a podcast right now.

**01:02:35** I have been doing speed tests of the studio while at home because I'm so happy about it.

**01:02:42** I will run a speed test for you right now for the studio. So I can tell you,

**01:02:47** cause I can do that now. Yeah. Good. I'm very happy for you.

**01:02:51** I'm sitting here with my 19 up and 17 down like a peasant.

**01:02:55** Oh my God. Great. How do you do anything?

**01:02:58** I don't know. I don't know how we're even able to talk to each other.

**01:03:01** Cause this was one of the things that I was like, Oh, cause I have really good

**01:03:03** internet at home too. Right? So I was like, you know, I'm, I'm very aware that you have

**01:03:07** great internet at home. Mike. Yeah.

**01:03:08** Every time you call out like, Hey, just do this feed test.

**01:03:11** See what you get. I'm very aware.

**01:03:13** You don't need to tell me that you have great internet at home.

**01:03:16** So I just got 889 down and 874 up. That is of my office speed test.

**01:03:23** Great. I'm very happy for you.

**01:03:25** It's great, right? Yeah. That's right.

**01:03:27** Isn't that fast? Oh no, wait. The speed test wasn't complete 9 16 down, 9 17 up.

**01:03:33** Great. Even better. Even better.

**01:03:35** It is better. Yeah.

**01:03:37** That is better. You were right. That was a hundred better each way.

**01:03:39** Right. It's fine. It's your, your margin of error is five times faster than my absolute speed.

**01:03:46** Yep. Yep. So, you know, it's still really expensive. It's still more money than I want

**01:03:53** to pay for internet, but at least I have really good internet.

**01:03:56** Okay. Good. I'm happy for you.

**01:03:59** I also wanted to share one last thing about like, uh, being at mega studio. Well,

**01:04:02** I actually have a bunch of stuff, but I'm going to talk about that later.

**01:04:05** Cause it's changing a lot about my work, right? But a couple of weeks ago,

**01:04:09** I was spending some time there while waiting for some deliveries and stuff.

**01:04:13** And I felt much more productive than when I'm at home. It reminded me of when I would co-work

**01:04:19** because in a working environment, I found myself getting a lot of little tasks done.

**01:04:24** I otherwise would procrastinate over because it was kind of like,

**01:04:28** but while I'm here, I might as well just do this thing instead of where I'm at home

**01:04:34** where I'm like, Oh, well I'll just do this thing. And it's a home related thing, you know?

**01:04:39** Well, you know, I'll just watch this or I'll go wash the dishes or I'll just go take a shower

**01:04:44** or like whatever, you know, like that type of procrastinating. Now I am work procrastinating,

**01:04:50** right? Actually finding other work things to do. It's how I feel when I take my early days as well.

**01:04:55** Right. You know, like the gradation idea where it's just like, well, I'm here. So I may as well

**01:05:00** do this thing. So I'm feeling pretty confident about my long-term productivity with the studio.

**01:05:05** That I will actually be getting more done when I'm there, which is what I wanted. So I'm

**01:05:12** feeling enthused about that. Right. Like that feels really good to me.

**01:05:16** Yeah. That's great. And like that's one of the main advantages of having an office outside

**01:05:20** of the house is like you can, you constrain the activities. It increases the kind of focus.

**01:05:27** You now have with your new mega studio, you have more space. So you're already,

**01:05:33** your brain is already turning towards like other projects that you could possibly do.

**01:05:38** Ooh, video. Maybe I'll get back into that. I think that's like, that's really great. And I'm

**01:05:43** happy to hear that. I'm happy to hear that your internet is so fast, but also I'm very happy to

**01:05:50** hear that even though you have been quarantined from it for a little while, that the like the

**01:05:56** mega studio is turning into what you want it to be. That it's like, it's a productive environment

**01:06:02** that is ultimately going to be like better for you and better for your work.

**01:06:06** Yeah. It is a slow process. I'm enjoying documenting it here, especially because,

**01:06:12** you know, we don't record every week. Right. So like a lot happens in between our recordings.

**01:06:17** So which is good. Are there going to be Instagram photos to update? Like,

**01:06:21** are we going to have more Instagram photos? I want to, I want to see like half because here's the

**01:06:25** thing. Yeah. Okay. You're going to be tempted on the grams to just show the shiny final office,

**01:06:29** but I want to, I want to see, I want to see updates of the, here's, here's what it looks

**01:06:34** like halfway through process. Okay. I don't have any now, but I'll take some to put, uh,

**01:06:39** I'll put some up and I'll share them with you, but I don't have anything at the moment because

**01:06:44** there's been the last vote is that I do have that I think I may have sent you one of them.

**01:06:48** There's been more progress in the space since then. Um, so I'll have some, I'll, I'll make sure to

**01:06:54** put some up so that I'll have them to put in the show notes, but it's good because this type,

**01:07:01** having longer periods of time is good because otherwise you would have got two weeks of despair.

**01:07:06** Right. So it's good to not have to have those. We miss the despair period. Yeah. The despair phase

**01:07:13** has passed for now. Maybe, uh, next time there will be more despair if like the plan doesn't work,

**01:07:19** but there was a plan which was abandoned and then there was no plan. And now we have a better

**01:07:25** plan in place again about the sound stuff. So, right. Well, I think in this time of global

**01:07:31** health situation, we did, we didn't need a despairful update from, from Mike. I'm happy.

**01:07:36** We skipped right over that and, and got to the, to the happy update about what's going on with

**01:07:42** mega studio. Today's episode is brought to you by fresh books, fresh books, create the super simple

**01:07:48** cloud accounting software that will help you save time and frustration when it comes to getting

**01:07:53** paid, when it comes to invoicing and so much more fresh books has drastically reduced the time it

**01:07:58** takes for their customers to deal with the paperwork related to their business. I have

**01:08:02** been using fresh books for nearly six years now and I would never use anything else.

**01:08:07** I absolutely love this system. We send out tons of invoices here at relay FM, and I just couldn't

**01:08:12** imagine doing it any other way. Their system is super simple. It's really easy to enter all the

**01:08:18** information that you need. The invoice builder is WYSIWYG, which means the way that I'm building it

**01:08:23** is the way that my client's going to see it. So I'm going to know exactly how everything's going to

**01:08:26** look. I love that information is saved so things can be selected from drop downs and it pre-fills

**01:08:31** a bunch of information for me. So I'm not writing out the same stuff every time, but the real magic

**01:08:36** happens once I've sent that invoice, I will see when it's been received. I'll see when it's been

**01:08:41** opened. I can even see when it's been printed. So I know that my clients have got the invoices,

**01:08:46** so we don't have to play that game of me chasing and seeing if they've read it and then having to

**01:08:51** answer and like it goes back and back and forth and forth. Nobody wants that. And one thing I

**01:08:55** really love about fresh books is that when I log in, I get my notification center right there.

**01:09:01** So it tells me what's changed since I've last logged in. I can see if somebody's late. I can

**01:09:05** see if somebody's accessed their invoice. Super awesome. I absolutely love it. I've even been able

**01:09:10** to integrate with our Slack so I can see when invoices are sent. I can see when people are

**01:09:14** logging in. It really helps me stay on top with how my business is sending money and making money.

**01:09:20** And that's super important. If you're listening to this and not yet using fresh books, now is the

**01:09:25** time to try it out. They are offering an unrestricted 30 day free trial for listeners of this show

**01:09:41** for a 30 day free trial. Our thanks to freshbooks for the continued support of this show and relay

**01:09:47** FM. I'll talk about tumbleweeds. Tumbleweeds. Who would want to talk about such a boring topic?

**01:09:52** You would. And I was genuinely surprised at the reception to that video. It seems to have done

**01:10:00** very well. Like this isn't, I don't mean this negatively, but like it was, it's a very, it's

**01:10:07** just much smaller video and like it feels to me like less zeitgeisty than some other stuff,

**01:10:15** you know, like I was, it's got like over 2 million views. Like it has performed very well.

**01:10:19** So I'm just curious because this is sort of like a, this video for me is an interesting example of

**01:10:25** a bunch of things, but I'm curious, what do you mean by the word like smaller when you say it's

**01:10:30** a smaller video? What does that, what does that mean to you? Okay, so well, because it's not short.

**01:10:37** No, it's, it's almost eight minutes. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. But I know, well, this comes from my knowledge

**01:10:45** of your work and some videos that you are working on now, I know you've been working on for years

**01:10:53** right. And have required like spanning the globe, which I am very confident you didn't do for this

**01:11:00** video. No, I know you have for you jump in. I know you have footage of tumbleweeds, but I know

**01:11:09** that that tumbleweed footage was not for this video. Like my expectation is because I know what

**01:11:15** you were doing when you encounter tumbleweeds, that that gave you the idea to make the video,

**01:11:19** but you weren't making like a tumbleweed video and went to find tumbleweeds. Right. Well, well,

**01:11:27** I mean, yeah, sort of, sort of. Yeah. You didn't go in search of tumbleweeds for like,

**01:11:34** you didn't travel across from England to somewhere in America to shoot video of tumbleweeds, right?

**01:11:40** Like that didn't happen. I look, because I've, I've got something else that's coming out. I know.

**01:11:45** Soon. So I cannot confirm or deny whether I did or did not travel, but I did travel as part of this

**01:11:51** tumbleweed project explicitly for tumbleweeds. So you're actually wrong about that. No, I know.

**01:11:57** See, I don't buy this gray. I don't buy this. Like you didn't go. You weren't in London. I'm like,

**01:12:04** I need to go to America to film tumbleweeds. You're trying to, like, you're trying to get

**01:12:08** me to talk about a future project. I'm not trying to get you started this. You knew what I meant.

**01:12:14** But like, so anyway, the tumbleweeds video. So listen, so listeners like, okay, there's so many

**01:12:20** things that have happened here. But like, Mike is confused because Mike does know some of my

**01:12:25** future stuff here. And like, I know what Mike thinks he thinks he's talking about, but he's

**01:12:28** not talking about what I think he's talking about. So all I'm saying is when I say this is a smaller

**01:12:35** video, right? I am not aware of you having been working on this tumbleweed video for a long time.

**01:12:41** Now it feels to me like it's more like a typical work length, right? Right. Which has not been what

**01:12:49** has been happening to you more recently, which is why you've shifted your business model a bit with

**01:12:53** focusing on the Patreon of like these really long spanning videos, which takes you going to

**01:12:59** places and understanding how things work. And like, so the tumbleweed video feels more like a

**01:13:05** typical idea where like something happened to you and you were like, this is interesting. Let me

**01:13:09** look into it. Okay. Which is so like there was an inciting event made you create the video,

**01:13:14** which is different to like, I'm going to investigate the entire history of people.

**01:13:20** Right. Right. And travel all over America

**01:13:24** looking at this stuff and finding out like it's very different. So when I say smaller, I mean more

**01:13:29** like regular. Right. Okay. Okay. Okay. You know, that's, that's fine. I was just, I'm just kind of

**01:13:36** curious about like what, you know, your perception of it. It's been really interesting because I keep,

**01:13:42** I keep thinking about the year of clarity stuff. And I think particularly because

**01:13:52** this is the most unactionable, nonspecific theme I've had on the show. I find myself sometimes

**01:14:00** thinking like, how can I explain what this means to me? Or like why, why this also feels like one

**01:14:04** of the most important themes that I've ever done. And you're not wrong in pegging something

**01:14:12** about like, Oh, this tumbleweed project feels kind of different and feels kind of small. And

**01:14:21** you're, you're, you're mostly right in that. I was, I was thinking about the thing I said last time,

**01:14:29** and I don't think I explained really well, but like one of these ideas that has, has come out

**01:14:38** of locking in topics is this ability that I feel like I have really figured out for me

**01:14:48** how it works best to explore potential future topics and how to stay focused, but also flexible.

**01:14:59** Right. And so this, this is where, so like Mike is obviously referencing like, Oh,

**01:15:05** the American Indian project has, has been this enormous project that I've been working on for

**01:15:09** a really long period of time. Yes. And I said in the, in I think the previous episode of Cortex,

**01:15:14** like, Oh, I'm going to have an animated video that sort of relates to this main thing. And

**01:15:22** I keep thinking of this as like the, as this phrase of fractal creativity of,

**01:15:30** you know, a fractal is an object that you can zoom into infinitely. And it's always sort of

**01:15:37** interesting and different. Like that's the fundamental feature of what a fractal is. You

**01:15:42** can magnify it a million times and you still have an interesting pattern. Whereas with, with most

**01:15:47** stuff, you magnified a million times and that, that doesn't happen. Like it still looks the same,

**01:15:52** you know, or just, it just becomes uninteresting when you magnify it too much. And so Indians has

**01:15:58** been topic locked for a long time of like, okay, I've got three things that I'm locked in on.

**01:16:05** American Indian project is one of them. But I'm also, I'm also aware of like, I think one of the

**01:16:12** things that I got, that I used to get more tripped up on and I feel like I've kind of solved now

**01:16:20** is I used to get kind of stuck behind bigger projects. And like Statue of Liberty is an

**01:16:28** example of this where it's like the Statue of Liberty video took a long time to make.

**01:16:33** And it's partly because I was a little bit confused about like, what is this is, what parts of this

**01:16:37** is Bill up and various things. But like it was easy to get kind of stuck behind a big project.

**01:16:43** But now I've, I've kind of figured out it's perfectly fine to, while you're working on a

**01:16:50** big project, zoom into parts that are interesting for whatever reason. As long as for me, it has

**01:17:01** this feeling of like down further into the fractal is perfectly fine. As a part of the

**01:17:12** as opposed to getting distracted by lateral topic exploration. So I think of this as like,

**01:17:19** you get like lost on Wikipedia, you go, Oh, I'm gonna look up something on Wikipedia. And you

**01:17:23** start to read. And in several clicks, you can be in a whole different world of things.

**01:17:30** I hear this a lot. I know people do this. I've, this has never happened to me.

**01:17:34** Really interesting. Okay.

**01:17:36** I just because, well, you know, it is very rare that I will decide to go and read a bunch of stuff.

**01:17:42** Right. You don't go on a Wikipedia wander. This happens to me more with YouTube than Wikipedia.

**01:17:47** Okay. Yeah. But YouTube is the same thing. Yeah. Like, I think it's the same,

**01:17:51** it's the same phenomenon expressing itself in different ways, where you're on YouTube and

**01:17:56** you're investigating something in particular. And instead of continually diving deeper into

**01:18:02** that topic, depending on what you're clicking on in the related fields, you can easily an hour

**01:18:08** later end up in a totally unrelated field. Right. Like, Oh, I started out looking up how to fix my

**01:18:15** sink. And now I'm watching a video about how lipstick is made. Right. It's like, I don't even

**01:18:19** know how did I get here? Right. Like, I don't know. There was some connection. I was just using

**01:18:23** Wikipedia as an example, because Wikipedia isn't algorithmically trying to keep you on the site

**01:18:28** for as long as possible. You can actually draw a line of like, how are all of these topics related

**01:18:33** to each other? Or are they? Oh God, I really, I really hope Wikipedia doesn't introduce

**01:18:40** algorithmic suggestions in a sidebar at some point. Although now, as soon as you say that it feels,

**01:18:46** it feels inevitable. What if it's an algorithm that's making the edits to, to link to other

**01:18:52** pages to just keep you in there? Right. Maybe. Although I know they do have a lot of bots

**01:18:57** already that do a lot of the maintenance work on Wikipedia. And, and if any internet project

**01:19:01** is going to become self-aware, maybe Wikipedia is it all the knowledge, all the knowledge.

**01:19:05** That's wrong. We shouldn't be plugging bots into all the knowledge. Someone needs to take care of

**01:19:10** that. Stop that. Yeah. I've heard many an AI researchers say something like, well, you know,

**01:19:15** we started designing an algorithm and we just downloaded all of Wikipedia and gave it to this,

**01:19:20** like maybe don't start with that. Don't give it like all of the knowledge we've amassed

**01:19:25** as humanity. Could you pick a different training set to just be the like,

**01:19:29** oh, I happened to give it something. Don't give it down. Here's the whole history of humans,

**01:19:33** everything they're good at and bad at. Give that to the robot. Yeah. Just as the starting point

**01:19:39** for learning. Then we'll give it like all of Google images. No, no problem.

**01:19:46** Yeah. Yeah. And then the bot is, is going from Wikipedia article to Wikipedia article going,

**01:19:50** oh, this is interesting. Oh, that's interesting. But, but so, so one of the things that become very

**01:19:57** aware of is the topic lock provides a kind of framework for me to think about what is not

**01:20:06** inside this boundary. And so I know it will seem crazy to people when I say, oh, this tumbleweed

**01:20:13** video, uh, came out of the Indians project. Like I don't think that that's going to be clear to

**01:20:21** people like how, how this process is. But to me, I, I have really been able to refine this kind of

**01:20:28** thinking in my own mind of tumbleweeds is further down the fractal of the Indian topic. It is related

**01:20:38** to this. There's steps where it, it goes from like the big topic down to the smaller topic.

**01:20:44** And yeah, when, when you say like, oh, it's a smaller video, that was also my perception of it.

**01:20:51** What you said there about like what you said about the fractals is a much more eloquent way of what

**01:20:56** I was trying to explain, which was like, I could see that this video was not a self-contained thing.

**01:21:02** Like it wasn't just a project you decided to embark upon. Like some of your other videos are

**01:21:10** like, it reminded me more about the planet video. Yes. Which was like you were doing something and

**01:21:18** then something popped out of it. Yeah. Yeah. And the planet video is another one of these perfect

**01:21:23** fractal videos. Like there was a bigger project. I ended up homing in on this fact about Mercury's

**01:21:29** orbit. And that bigger project has is now when I was reassessing like which topics are locked,

**01:21:39** that bigger project kind of bumped out to, I'll consider it at a later point of like, I'm still

**01:21:45** interested in that project, but I'm not going to give it one of these three locked slots. Like I've

**01:21:50** picked something interesting out of it and that one's temporarily on pause. But the Indian one has

**01:21:55** been topic locked for a long time. And one of the things that, that I like, I like to do this kind

**01:22:01** of stuff because I know it's the sort of thing that I as a viewer appreciate. But if you go back and

**01:22:07** you look at all of the videos I've released since the Statue of Liberty video, you can see how many

**01:22:15** times I use the little cartoon American Indian girl when it's not really necessary for her to

**01:22:21** be there, but she's like she pops up. And that's kind of an indication of look at all of these

**01:22:28** videos that have come out of this project in one way or another. And it's why in the tumbleweed

**01:22:35** video, like the American Indian girl, she's there for two seconds. Does she need to be there? Not

**01:22:41** really. But this is part of the thing that I like to do with making videos over long periods of time

**01:22:48** is you can put these fun little connections between them. And that's one of the things I've

**01:22:54** been kind of laying down for people who are really attentive viewers to see of like, oh,

**01:22:59** here's all the Indians of the GCU, like the gray cinematic universe, like all of these things are

**01:23:05** connected in a like in a weird way. It kind of is. Yeah, it is. That's that's that's the gray

**01:23:11** cinematic universe you're building there. You know, like different different types of people

**01:23:16** make different kinds of things. And I think you always have to take advantage of what makes you

**01:23:23** different. And so I as a YouTube channel, I think it will come as news to no one. I'm not the fastest

**01:23:31** producer of videos like they take a long time. But what that means and what I feel like I've

**01:23:37** really sorted out over the past year or so is this ability through topic lock and through some other

**01:23:44** things related to your clarity of how do I have parallel projects? But also keep forward motion on

**01:23:55** all of these things. And it's just really interesting to me because I think if you go back and listen

**01:24:00** to Cortex, like this has always been something I've struggled with of how many projects am I

**01:24:05** working on at once? And it's like, I've always had a really hard time with this. And it finally feels

**01:24:12** like something I've really locked down. But one of the big advantages is, okay, if you're a channel

**01:24:18** that doesn't produce stuff quickly, and you're producing a couple of parallel things over a long

**01:24:24** period of time, there are totally ways in which you can make them connect to each other. Or you you can

**01:24:31** show kind of like a wink at the viewer to see like this thing is related to that thing. And I really

**01:24:38** enjoy doing that because I really like that as a viewer. And it's it's why I really wanted to try

**01:24:44** to work in the American Indian Girl to the tumbleweed video. Because it's not it's less clear now,

**01:24:54** but I think in a few months, viewers will be able to really clearly draw the connection between

**01:25:03** three videos of like, Oh, here is the exact path. Gray started here, this thing happened,

**01:25:10** this thing happened, and then he made the tumbleweed video. And so it sort of goes back to like a thing

**01:25:15** we mentioned forever ago about this really nonlinear life. But one of the ways I feel like I

**01:25:21** figured out how to keep forward motion is sometimes working on things in this reverse order of like,

**01:25:29** work from the bottom of the fractal up to the higher layers of the fractal. And the tumbleweed

**01:25:37** one is just a perfect example of this, like this is the bottom of the bottom of anything that can

**01:25:41** be considered to be an American Indians video. And two videos from now in this little series,

**01:25:48** it'll be much clearer like, Oh, how did I how did I get here? But it isn't it isn't right now. And

**01:25:54** part of the reason I feel so confident about I've kind of figured out this process is

**01:26:01** like, for the first time in my nine year career of working on YouTube, I have a video that is

**01:26:11** completely finished ahead of time. Like, it is edited, it is done, it is uploaded to my channel,

**01:26:21** and I'm just waiting to release it. Because I want to finish something else before that video

**01:26:28** goes up. Congratulations to you on many fronts there. I mean that seriously and sincerely,

**01:26:33** because not only have you done it, which has proven that your method has worked, that you

**01:26:38** are restraining yourself. Yeah, because I know how difficult that can be. Like you have a thing

**01:26:42** that's made, and someone else can make it. Right? Like that's always the fear. But yeah, I think

**01:26:48** this is the combination of the year of clarity, but also your time away from the internet, right

**01:26:54** project Cyclops. Yeah, I think it has allowed you to not be so terrified about somebody scooping you

**01:27:02** basically, that you are confident in your work now, that even if that happens, it doesn't matter

**01:27:08** because it's your work. And people want to see your work, no matter if it's been done a million

**01:27:13** times before, because you have your process, you have your outlook, you have your opinion,

**01:27:19** and people like that. So like, I think that that is a an example of your growth over the last few

**01:27:26** years with these elements that you've been focusing on, that one, you've been able to do it, and two,

**01:27:31** that you're comfortable with it just not being visible. Yeah, yeah, I mean, there's a couple

**01:27:40** of things here, like, why was that able to happen? One of the reasons is it's a real life video, so

**01:27:47** it's not an animated video that's done and complete. But it is on a thing that is totally

**01:27:54** scoopable. It's not like my Tesla road trip, right? Where someone can't scoop that because like, hey,

**01:28:00** here's a thing I did, right? It's, you know, so I have a real life thing, and it is theoretically

**01:28:06** scoopable, but I'm happy to like, leave it the way that it is. I don't want to leave it forever,

**01:28:12** because like, I do still have that little bit of concern. But this is where I'm talking about

**01:28:18** this idea of like, what's the order in the fractal? And it's like, okay, tumbleweed is first,

**01:28:24** this thing, it's done. And in theory, I could upload it. But I want to make sure I have another

**01:28:30** layer up done first before I release this. And so so do you have a video that's coming before it,

**01:28:37** or you just want to get to a point in the video that's coming after it before you release this

**01:28:41** one? I just want to make sure I understand that I want to get to a point in the video after before

**01:28:47** I release this next one. Because for whatever reason, you don't want to leave too long a gap

**01:28:52** between the two, right? Yeah, the two things are connected. And I just want to make sure I'm far

**01:28:58** enough along in this in the next related thing before I release this, this one is finished.

**01:29:04** So you don't end up in a Summer of Grey scenario, right? Where it's like, this is part two, and part one and three will come in like two years.

**01:29:12** Yes, that's exactly correct. It could, it's, it's less clear than that. But that's the same idea of,

**01:29:18** oh, here's, here's the thing. I also have something that's related, it'll be out in two years. Goodbye.

**01:29:24** So that's why I'm kind of holding on. It's really shocking to me that I have a video that's done,

**01:29:31** even if it's not an animated video, like I cannot believe that I have something ahead of time in this,

**01:29:35** in this way. And also with the topic lock, it's like, okay, Tumbleweeds is this thing, but I also have

**01:29:43** another sort of fun, small, totally isolated, not connected to anything little animated video that's

**01:29:50** in the works that's topic locked and is like, it's going along really well. And you were bugging

**01:29:55** me about, did I travel for Tumbleweeds? And the answer is yes. But I also have a video for that

**01:30:00** coming along really well and hopefully should be done reasonably soon. No, I see. I just,

**01:30:07** you didn't go for the Tumbleweeds though, did you? Like, I know the other thing.

**01:30:13** You didn't go for the Tumbleweeds and then go to the other thing. You did to the other thing and

**01:30:17** there were Tumbleweeds. No, you're, I won't believe this is true. You don't do like, like, Mike, do I

**01:30:23** have to, I have to whisper to you what the thing is and you have to bleep it because like, I don't

**01:30:27** know what you're thinking about, but I went, I went to like, Mike, I went to the car. Do you know that?

**01:30:33** Do you know this thing? No. Okay. Right. Well, that's, that's the thing that I did. No, that has

**01:30:39** nothing to do with this thing. You don't know what I'm talking about. Do you see why I'm in this

**01:30:43** situation? That's, yeah, that's why. Wait, what is it? Wait, is the, is, is it? Look, look,

**01:30:50** there's going to be so many bleeps in this section. I can't explain it to you. I'm going to cut out

**01:30:54** because it's too much bleeping. No, no, it's funny here. If it's bleeping. Okay. No, is it, wait,

**01:30:59** what are we talking about now? We're talking about tumble weeds. That's what we're talking about.

**01:31:05** Okay. You understand why I got to this point. I totally understand. But now at this point,

**01:31:11** I will say fine. Right. You win on that. Thank you. But now I understand a little bit more about

**01:31:18** the link between this video and the next video. Right. Yeah. Because I've seen the next one,

**01:31:23** I think. Right. Yes. Yeah. You, you, you have seen the thing that is done and is up on my channel

**01:31:29** and it's just waiting. Right. So I think the thing we can say is as annoying as all that censoring is

**01:31:35** one gray said I had to censor. It wasn't my choice. And two, it isn't going to be six years

**01:31:40** until you find out what we were talking about. So that's good. Yeah. Yeah. It's, it's, I mean,

**01:31:44** I hope it's going to be something like a couple of weeks at most. Uh, so yeah, it'll, it'll be

**01:31:49** pretty fast, but look, look for me editing something that's like a vlog in under three

**01:31:58** weeks is like lightning fast. Right. So that's my perspective. There is no criticism here. I don't

**01:32:05** know. I like it's, it's so it's been a really interesting year so far. And, uh, like I was,

**01:32:14** I was talking last time about like, oh, the month of unexpected urgency, which has become a lot more

**01:32:19** like, like the two months of unexpected urgency. But even, even through all of this, what you said

**01:32:26** about some of the long run byproducts of my year away from the internet that totally works into it.

**01:32:34** And it's why year of clarity to me feels very much like there's a lot of threads over the past few

**01:32:42** years that have all come together right around the same time and are, are, are working to help each

**01:32:50** other. And, and one of, one of those things is just recognizing in my own work process that

**01:32:57** like, I am just a person who works really well in isolation, like just, just on my own, focused on

**01:33:11** projects for long periods of time with as little of the outside world as I can manage to get by

**01:33:19** without. And I know that I've always been crazy about this stuff, like managing my notifications

**01:33:24** and trying to clamp all that stuff down. And I, I feel like I'm just, I'm just really, really

**01:33:33** leaning into that because it's also the thing that makes my video work. So clearly much better of,

**01:33:42** you know, I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna get up in the mornings and I'm gonna try to be isolated on,

**01:33:47** on this work. And if a day is going really well, like I'm just gonna stay isolated and I'm just

**01:33:54** gonna keep working on this thing. And there's something about it that I, it's hard to put my

**01:34:00** finger on, but it feels like something has, has changed and it's just more satisfying. And it's,

**01:34:07** it's part of the way as well. Like even during what, what would have been in past years,

**01:34:13** a incredibly disruptive outside environment that would have completely destroyed my ability to

**01:34:19** make videos. I've, I've ended up in a situation where it's like tumbleweed video came out, boy,

**01:34:25** do I love it. And it's great. Oh, by the way, I also have another video that's like ready and

**01:34:29** waiting to go. And there's, there's like two more in the chamber that are coming along really well.

**01:34:35** And, and part of this is just some hard to articulate thoughts about how am I selecting topics

**01:34:43** and some more practical stuff about, Hey, your temperament is like to work on your own,

**01:34:52** on projects sort of in this isolated way in the way that people for all of time who did work that

**01:35:01** revolved around reading and writing always would have. And like, just, just lean into that. And I

**01:35:07** don't know, like you're really happy about mega studio. And I feel like I'm, I'm really happy

**01:35:12** about the way my video production process is, is going now. And I think, I think like year of

**01:35:19** clarity is, is really the correct focusing thought around a bunch of decisions related to all of this

**01:35:25** stuff. This episode is brought to you by ExpressVPN. There are tons of VPN providers out there,

**01:36:37** Oh yeah. For your Patreon backers. Yes. Oh, live streaming, Mike. Live streaming. Now I want to

**01:36:44** just ask what, how, how did you do the live streaming? What do you, what, oh, but badly,

**01:36:50** I guess is the answer. Yeah. I don't know. I've seen, I've seen most of the video, like, and the

**01:36:56** video begins like the Patreon video begins with you basically saying, Oh, finally an hour later.

**01:37:03** I was like, Oh boy. Yeah. Love trouble over there. Yeah. Uh, what am I wave wire cast? Yeah. Wirecast.

**01:37:12** I sent you a text message. Okay. Did you not see my text message that I sent you?

**01:37:17** What? Just now? No, no. Like on the day you announced the live stream, you announced I'm

**01:37:22** going to live stream today. And then I sent you an I message. Didn't I? Uh, look, look, Mike, I,

**01:37:28** I was having a hell of a day. This was before, this was before, this was hours before. This was

**01:37:34** when you announced you were going to do it. And I sent you a message. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. This thing

**01:37:39** about like Ecamm live, powerful Mac streaming. Yes. No, look, I, I understand that when I announced

**01:37:46** that there was going to be a director's commentary, you sent me a thing about a brand new piece of

**01:37:49** software that I immediately put out of my mind. Cause I thought, you know what I'm not going to do

**01:37:53** at the 11th hour here, swap out what I think is going to be easy to use. I feel like this is the

**01:37:59** one I used and didn't like. Do you like this? It only came out like eight months ago. It is,

**01:38:08** I've tried lots of things for the Mac. This is the easiest Mac, live streaming software I've used.

**01:38:13** Yeah. This is the one you should be using. Okay. I'm clicking or you should just get a PC and

**01:38:20** no, that's what I'm going to do. And you get stream labs and then you're fine.

**01:38:24** But if you're not going to do that, this is what you should use. Like me and Steven used it for

**01:38:29** a bunch of stuff leading up to the podcastathon. Okay. Okay. I've downloaded it. It's on my desktop.

**01:38:35** This is what you should use. If you're going to do these again, which I think you will,

**01:38:38** cause I've, it seemed like it went really well and it's a good little perk for your Patreon.

**01:38:44** Look, I used Wirecast and it only, it only took me an hour to close to 90 minutes to get it to work.

**01:38:51** You used one of the absolutely most complicated pieces of software I've ever come across.

**01:38:59** Okay. Look, that's, that's the one, the roulette wheel of me looking online to find software. Like

**01:39:05** that's what that landed on. Yeah. Ecamm is a new kid on the block with this. So like it's not very

**01:39:10** well known. I will give it a try because I could never quite figure out what it was, but there

**01:39:14** was some audio button I would press and Wirecast that would start a self feedback loop of the audio

**01:39:20** that would immediately spiral into the maximum volume that someone's computer could output.

**01:39:27** And that was, that was like, that's not what I want to be doing. It's like literally injuring

**01:39:33** the ears of the people who were, who are, who are being very kind and are there for the

**01:39:38** pre-stream trying to help me set up the stream. They are giving you both time and money, right?

**01:39:45** And then you'll blow it out the ear drums. It was bad, but there was a very dedicated group of

**01:39:49** people who were trying to help me fumble through setting up a, setting up a live stream. But doing

**01:39:55** something like a director's commentary is something that's been on my mind for a while.

**01:40:03** As a thing to do. And it's one of the reasons why when we talked a few months ago about how I,

**01:40:10** how I switched the Patreon model, this was one of the things in the back of my mind of,

**01:40:19** because I mean, Patreon is, is a company that's been around for a while. And when they started,

**01:40:25** you had the option of like, Oh, per thing or per month. And those things were sort of treated

**01:40:31** equally, but as time has gone on, the features and the way Patreon works are really all lean,

**01:40:38** lean towards the monthly system. There wasn't a good way to be able to do something like, Oh, hey,

**01:40:45** I have this video. If you want to watch it, you can just pay the $5, watch the video, and then

**01:40:54** cancel the next month's payment, right? Like there wasn't, there was no way to do that under the old

**01:40:59** system of like, per thing. Yeah, because you would have had to get people to sign up before

**01:41:05** you did the thing. So then when the thing happened, a payment would be triggered, which is like a

**01:41:09** terrible way to try to manage it. Yeah, it was really, it was really frustrating. And there are

**01:41:14** a number of things that I was thinking about with like, I'm fighting the system here and it's causing

**01:41:20** me problems with just trying to think about stuff. So the director's commentary had been on my mind

**01:41:25** for a long time. And it's partly because we've discussed on the show, it's hard sometimes to

**01:41:32** think about, you know, when you, when you have an audience like, like we have with this show,

**01:41:39** you will have people ask for things that don't necessarily make sense. Or you think you wouldn't

**01:41:45** actually like it if we gave it to you. And that's what we've discussed many times with an unedited

**01:41:49** version of this show, for example. Exactly. Yes. The people who support the show, they're like,

**01:41:53** hey, I'd love an unedited version. And the answer is no, you wouldn't. Right. You just don't want

**01:41:58** that. The thing I was saying is you may enjoy if you already enjoy the show maybe, but like this

**01:42:03** isn't, isn't the show you want. Right. One of the reasons you enjoy the show is because of how hard

**01:42:07** we edit it. Please trust me on that one. Yeah. Yeah. Always show a screenshot of like the hundreds

**01:42:12** and hundreds of edits you do. Yeah. I will put a screenshot in the show notes of the edit of this

**01:42:17** episode and then you will see how much was taken out. So if you even at this point in the show,

**01:42:21** you're like, oh, this is a good episode so far. It's because of everything I cut.

**01:42:25** Yeah. Yeah. It really is true. And so I've always had the same thing with the YouTube channel where

**01:42:32** people are asking for stuff, things like show us the deleted scenes and the way I make videos,

**01:42:38** if I have a deleted scene, it's because I've done something terribly wrong. Like it should never get

**01:42:44** to the, the should never have got to animation. Yes, exactly. Like it should never have gotten

**01:42:48** to the state where I recorded something and it was animated in the entire time. I've done this.

**01:42:53** I've only ever once had a deleted scene, which was from the fable of the dragon tyrant, where

**01:43:00** much later I realized there was a little section that could be cut and nothing would be lost.

**01:43:05** But it's like that just shouldn't happen with the tightly animated videos. And so people would ask

**01:43:12** for like deleted scenes or people would ask for a bunch of the behind the scenes stuff. And I always

**01:43:17** just had like, I had a hard time trying to think about what is a way that this makes sense to show

**01:43:25** people. So like people would ask sometimes for, oh, show us your notes on this thing. Like I'd love

**01:43:31** to see more of the details that, that went out. It's like, it's not really a thing that makes sense

**01:43:38** to just show or like it totally loses all of the context. So it was part of my previous summer

**01:43:46** when I was driving around in America, that it dawned on me that something like a director's

**01:43:51** commentary would make sense. And I was waiting to be able to change the business model so it could

**01:43:57** actually support that. And I was also waiting for what felt like the right video to start it with.

**01:44:07** Tumbleweeds just happened to be the, the right video at the right time. Like I love it as a topic

**01:44:14** and it's a topic that is, is weirdly infinite. Like you can just, there's so much detail that

**01:44:22** ended up being part of this. And I often think of the natural discussion size or the natural

**01:44:31** discussion length for topics. And so you can make a five minute video about tumbleweed. And if you

**01:44:38** make a five minute video about tumbleweed, then you have to limit what you talk about,

**01:44:44** but it also can spread further because what people don't want is a university length course

**01:44:54** on tumbleweed management, right? People don't want to sit through all of that.

**01:44:58** But then there's like on this podcast, we can talk about how is this video made? And that's,

**01:45:06** that's sort of a longer conversation about the production of the video or like how did this come

**01:45:11** to be or why was I thinking about it in this way? And that's like a podcast natural length of

**01:45:18** discussion or maybe as I did, you can go talk to experts and spend eight hours discussing tumbleweed

**01:45:26** with people. And that's a very different kind of thing. And the director's commentary concept made

**01:45:35** me realize, oh, here is a natural size of discussion that hits a bunch of bullet points.

**01:45:45** Bullet point number one is it doesn't have to be a thing that takes up hours and hours and hours of

**01:45:53** my time to prepare for because when I'm doing the discussion about the behind the scenes production

**01:46:00** commentary of the video, I will have just finished thinking about this for six to eight

**01:46:07** weeks in a row in a very intense way. So like it is all in my head. And for the people who are

**01:46:15** asking about more behind the scenes stuff, it can have the details that don't make sense to talk

**01:46:23** about like on a podcast or to upload as a separate video. So for example, Mike, I would not make you

**01:46:32** sit through on this show. Hey, let me run through my favorite highlights that I made in this 1890

**01:46:41** Department of Agriculture report on the situation in tumbleweed out in the West.

**01:46:46** I think that conversation as well, like it just doesn't work as well in this setting.

**01:46:52** Like it does work better when there is a visual component to. Yeah, it works better with a visual

**01:46:57** component. And it just it's just it's this thing about different size discussions are better in

**01:47:05** different formats or better in different places. And I just just sort of felt like, okay,

**01:47:12** this is a thing that makes sense. I think it kind of answers the question of of what a lot of the

**01:47:19** people who crowdfund the video are looking for like, hey, tell me more about this.

**01:47:24** Why? You've kind of opened yourself up to it. Like if you came to this episode and then we

**01:47:29** start talking about tumbleweed in like a lot of detail, probably wasn't what you were expecting.

**01:47:35** And maybe it'd be a bit like, I don't know why I'm being subjected to this conversation.

**01:47:42** Yeah, yeah. Right. Well, that's the other thing is it's a very self-selecting audience of who

**01:47:47** wants to listen to this much detail, right? Which Cortex is a much broader audience than the like,

**01:47:53** who really wants to know all the details? Like it's a self-selection effect as well.

**01:47:58** It is a thing that had been on my mind. I've been again with year of clarity, feeling like a lot of

**01:48:03** stuff is coming together. I was at the point where I had set it up so that it could make sense and it

**01:48:07** could work. I'd also played around with streaming on my other channels and like, okay, I had an idea

**01:48:14** of how to do this at least barely competently. So that came together and yeah, I think it went well.

**01:48:23** It's very interesting to do. I'm still regarding it as experimental at this point in time,

**01:48:29** but it's something that at least for the animated videos, I think I'm going to continue to do going

**01:48:36** forward. I don't think it makes sense for the live action stuff because that's just way less dense.

**01:48:43** It's much less intense of a project, but yeah. So anyway, it's just like us talking about our

**01:48:49** businesses and like, what can we do? And this was an experiment that is initially promising

**01:48:56** and that I think fills a space of people are interested and it's a right discussion size for

**01:49:03** a certain kind of thing. I think I found a bag for you. Okay. So I heard about this on one of my

**01:49:12** favorite podcasts to do by Friday company Tom, then who we know. Yeah. Click link. They make a

**01:49:18** thing called the handy little thing pouch. It's like the courtility bag that you always dreamed

**01:49:24** of. I think it's a little bag and you can put it on a sling or on a strap that goes around your

**01:49:30** waist. They have it in different sizes and it's got a bunch of pockets inside.

**01:49:34** No, no. Okay. Okay. Uh, one, two big, too big. Yeah. Okay. I'm looking at the small one.

**01:49:54** It's too big. It's too like, I think it's a good product. Small ones too big. Yes. The small ones

**01:50:01** too big. It's a good product. I like this idea of a little bag that you can have some vital items

**01:50:08** in for travel. Like I might, I might use that actually. But if you're thinking this is the

**01:50:15** courtility bag that I want, this is, this is not the thing. Like I want something. Yeah. That's

**01:50:22** just, that's just like an additional pocket, right? That's that's small or I can put some,

**01:50:28** some additional things. It's basically a clip on pocket is what you're looking for.

**01:50:32** Kind of. Yeah. I'm kind of looking for something like a clip on pocket. So this is, this is too

**01:50:36** much. I appreciate, I appreciate what you're trying to do here, but I'm going to veto this

**01:50:41** as a satisfactory bag. All right. And keep looking out for you then. Yeah. Thank you. I appreciate

**01:50:46** that. Uh, it did, it did make me think about bags in general though. Like I'm thinking about bags

**01:50:50** again, because I'm probably going to need a daily bag now, which I haven't needed in a long time.

**01:50:56** Why? For moving from home to studio. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. There will be little

**01:51:02** things that I will want to bring with me frequently, not every day, uh, like stuff like pens, uh, coffee

**01:51:09** stuff, maybe food. Um, you know, like there might be a time where I will want to take an iPad there

**01:51:15** and back, uh, like stuff like that. Right. And it's not going to be every day, but it's going to be

**01:51:21** frequently enough that I'm thinking I will want to have a more like daily bag again. No, no, don't

**01:51:26** do this. Don't do this, Mike. Just double up, double up everything that you can ever conceive of in

**01:51:31** the office. Everything. Right. Okay. Okay. Sandwiches. No, but sandwiches, you can, you can

**01:51:37** bring in a little brown paper bag like you're going to school, but no, pens. No iPads. No, you should

**01:51:43** have redundant equipment in mega studio so that you're packing. That's crazy making like I'm just,

**01:51:52** no, no, don't do this. Don't do this, Mike. Just get redundant equipment, please.

**01:51:56** I'm begging you. I can't, I don't think I can live with the idea that you have a whole mega studio

**01:52:02** and then you have a bag full of junk that you're bringing back and forth frequently. So when you

**01:52:07** had the glass cube, you had no bag that you took with you. I had no, I had literally no bag. And it

**01:52:16** was, it was like, it was like being a leaf on the wind, right? It was just freedom. It was great.

**01:52:22** Everything I could conceive of, there was a redundant version of it in the glass cube.

**01:52:28** This is how you should live life, Mike. Don't start schlepping a bag, please, for your own sake.

**01:52:38** I see I found a bag that I like though. No, okay. Now, if you want to buy a bag because you like the

**01:52:44** bag, that's a totally different thing. Right. But this bag would only be useful to me in this

**01:52:48** situation because like it's not big enough. I don't think like for like traveling. Okay. It's

**01:52:52** more of like a daily bag. Okay. But okay. No, I'm gonna, I'm gonna take your advice and I'm not gonna

**01:53:00** buy the bag. It's a million times too big. Don't do this. I think, I think you should seriously

**01:53:05** consider this as a constraint to focus you on realizing what do you want to have in mega office?

**01:53:14** All right. So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna postpone bag buying. Okay. I'm not gonna buy

**01:53:19** this bag now, right? Like, and I will do what you are suggesting because I have bags right now,

**01:53:25** which I am using to take stuff to the office, but then most of the stuff is staying there or it's

**01:53:30** stuff that has to come back on because I don't have it set up yet. But I think I, I think I am

**01:53:36** on board with this idea that you're setting out, right? Where like maybe the things that I'm

**01:53:43** mentioning, I could just have a tote bag, right? To put my coffee cup and my sandwich box in, right?

**01:53:49** Like that. And that's like a different situation. That's like basically a carrier bag. Like it's not

**01:53:54** a gear bag of any kind, right? You know, like a regular tote bag, not this tote backpack.

**01:54:00** You know what I mean? Like a canvas tote bag. If I want to take a sandwich to the office.

**01:54:05** Okay. Sandwich. Yes. Coffee cup. What do you mean by coffee? One of those travel coffee mugs.

**01:54:11** Like I'm planning on making coffee at home before I leave because I have really good equipment here.

**01:54:16** Okay. Right. And putting it in like a flask cup thing and taking it with me to the office to have

**01:54:22** on the go. This is like a not necessarily a thing I'm going to do, but like a thing I'll get to

**01:54:26** sometimes. Okay. All right. All right. I have to, I have to also just reframe my brain for the way

**01:54:32** that you use coffee. So you just want to have, you want to have coffee on your way to the office.

**01:54:37** That's fine. Maybe. That's fine. Like that isn't necessarily something I'm going to do,

**01:54:40** but it might be something that I do sometimes. Like if I'm in a rush. What you're not, what you're

**01:54:44** not doing, what you're not doing is you're not bringing a cup, which is your favorite coffee

**01:54:49** cup. No, that I will have a coffee cup at the office. Okay. Okay. Probably. Right. Because I'm

**01:54:56** no, no, no, no. Like, cause I'm not, because there's also like, I might just go to the cafe,

**01:55:01** which is like next to the place. Right. Like, what are you going to do when people come visit

**01:55:05** when they're at the hot desk and they're like, Oh, where's the coffee? Oh, we're going to have

**01:55:08** like glasses and water and stuff, but like coffee, I don't know if we're going to have,

**01:55:12** we don't have a sink in the studio. Who's going to, who's going to visit you if there's no coffee

**01:55:17** in your studio. Not me. But there is a, I can just get you a coffee from the coffee shop.

**01:55:22** How far is that coffee shop? Like that's super close. Like you would be there in 20 seconds.

**01:55:26** Okay. Maybe that's satisfied. There's actually like three. There's like lots of options, right?

**01:55:31** It's like, we're in a town here. They're in a sea. But anyway, like, I just haven't worked out the,

**01:55:36** if there's going to be an in studio coffee solution yet, because it will require effort,

**01:55:41** right? Because we don't have a sink. So you'd have to go to the communal sink to deal with that. And

**01:55:45** I just haven't worked out how or if that's going to work. All right. No bag. Okay. Great. For now.

**01:55:55** I'll take it. I'll take it. I feel like I've saved a life today. That's how,

**01:56:00** that's how relieved I feel. Wow. All right. Cortex movie club next time.

**01:56:04** Movie club. We're going to be watching inside Bill's brain. This is a three part series on

**01:56:10** Netflix. We've watched the whole thing. So there'll just be one episode, all three episodes.

**01:56:15** It's basically one big three hour documentary that they cut up into three parts. It doesn't

**01:56:20** really need to be three episodes specifically, but it's structured that way. This is pretty

**01:56:24** relevant right now. It's kind of funny. Bill Gates has just stepped down from Microsoft's

**01:56:29** board to focus on his philanthropy. And it is mostly about his, well, it's kind of like the

**01:56:36** documentary focuses on mostly the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, but then looks back at his

**01:56:42** history and how it applies to the things that he's now doing as a philanthropist.

**01:56:47** The reason that I, well, you will understand the reasons when you've watched this as to why I think

**01:56:51** this is relevant for the show, but like it does focus a lot on the type of person Bill Gates is

**01:56:56** and as his leader and also how he thinks and works. And this is now the second time that I've seen it,

**01:57:03** because I watched it a few months ago and I put it on the list because it was like,

**01:57:08** felt so prime to talk about on the show. So don't watch it. It's on Netflix. It's great.

**01:57:14** And we're going to talk about it on the next episode. Okay.
