# Cortex - 118: Season of Uncertainty
**00:00:00** I brought all my good gear to the studio now.

**00:00:03** Oh yeah?

**00:00:03** Yeah, a couple of weeks ago,

**00:00:04** I realized like my good audio interface,

**00:00:07** the one that I like the most, the USB pre-2,

**00:00:11** that's been at home for, it never came to the studio.

**00:00:16** And I was using more Zoom kind of recorder here,

**00:00:19** which is like a traveling piece of equipment.

**00:00:21** And so I swapped them over a couple of weeks ago.

**00:00:24** Felt like I made a bit of a commitment to the studio

**00:00:27** that way, which was nice.

**00:00:29** So you're doing 100% of your podcast recording

**00:00:31** from the studio now?

**00:00:31** That's one of the reasons that made me do it,

**00:00:33** is I don't record anything from home now,

**00:00:37** unless there's like some very particular reason.

**00:00:40** Like I recorded something really late a couple of nights ago

**00:00:43** and so I just did it from home.

**00:00:44** But yeah, now all of my regular shows,

**00:00:47** they're all recorded at the studio now.

**00:00:50** I'm here every day, like I'm here at least five days a week.

**00:00:52** But bringing all the good equipment over,

**00:00:54** that's an exciting final step.

**00:00:56** Yeah, it was a commitment.

**00:00:57** Yeah, you're really committed to this office

**00:00:59** after only 18 months or so.

**00:01:05** Something like that.

**00:01:08** Well, congratulations for bringing

**00:01:09** the last piece of audio equipment over.

**00:01:11** Yeah, I've got this whole thing all set up.

**00:01:12** Nice, I've got my nice yellow iMac

**00:01:14** and sits on this like stand, right?

**00:01:17** Because Apple refused to make the stands tall enough.

**00:01:20** Oh yeah, I know.

**00:01:21** The shortness of their little feet for the monitors

**00:01:24** are incredibly frustrating.

**00:01:26** But I have a nice stand made by a company called Grove Made.

**00:01:29** You've probably come across this company before.

**00:01:31** They make a lot of these kinds of like stands

**00:01:34** and cases and that kind of stuff.

**00:01:36** It's nice because it's like made of the same kind of wood

**00:01:38** as my desk, so it all matches in quite nicely.

**00:01:40** Very nice.

**00:01:41** So, and I have a second monitor now, which is great.

**00:01:45** I use like my old Dell monitor

**00:01:46** that I was using for the Mac Mini before.

**00:01:49** Now just sits off to the side of the iMac

**00:01:52** and that's where I put all the recording apps.

**00:01:54** I'm feeling pretty settled, you know, it's quite nice.

**00:01:58** Have you built yourself a little booth?

**00:01:59** I just realized I don't know

**00:02:00** what the final setup for your audio was.

**00:02:03** You didn't want to build yourself a little recording call.

**00:02:06** So I don't know what the final result was

**00:02:08** for dampening the audio.

**00:02:09** It didn't change.

**00:02:10** So I'm still, I have two like sound insulating panels

**00:02:13** behind me and then I still have the curtains.

**00:02:15** Remember the big curtains?

**00:02:17** I still have those on the left and right of me.

**00:02:20** And I found that it does a pretty good job.

**00:02:22** Actually, just before we were recording

**00:02:24** when I was talking to you,

**00:02:25** I could hear an echo to the left side

**00:02:27** and I just adjusted the curtain a little bit

**00:02:29** and it's gone away.

**00:02:30** So just doing a good job.

**00:02:32** They are not pretty, but it's functional.

**00:02:35** I mean, ultimately having been here

**00:02:38** for the time that we've been here and you know,

**00:02:40** there's still things that I want

**00:02:41** and there's still things that we want to do,

**00:02:45** but we're thinking that it's ultimately,

**00:02:48** it's kind of like a similar thing

**00:02:49** to wanting to own our own home.

**00:02:51** We kind of want to own our own office space.

**00:02:54** And so I think that is probably the plan

**00:02:56** for the next few years,

**00:02:58** because it's very restrictive when we're renting here.

**00:03:00** There's only so many things we're allowed to do.

**00:03:02** And you know, we can't put anything on the walls

**00:03:05** very easily or we have to, you know,

**00:03:07** it's just like a whole thing.

**00:03:08** And you know, like the shared bathroom

**00:03:12** and shared kitchen experience is kind of

**00:03:14** as you would expect it to be.

**00:03:15** And it's less than ideal.

**00:03:16** So we'll probably be here, I reckon, for a couple of years,

**00:03:20** but the long-term goal now, I think,

**00:03:23** is to try and find something in our area,

**00:03:30** which we could acquire through the business

**00:03:34** and own our own space.

**00:03:36** I don't know how realistic that's gonna be or possible,

**00:03:39** but I think that would be my ideal.

**00:03:43** I don't really like being in a situation like this

**00:03:46** that we can't fully control.

**00:03:49** And like, can I just say, I never rent,

**00:03:50** I never lived in rental accommodation.

**00:03:52** I lived at home until I was ready to buy.

**00:03:55** Just the way I am as a person,

**00:03:56** I kind of don't like being beholden

**00:04:00** to a landlord in that way, you know?

**00:04:03** And so I was lucky enough to have a home environment

**00:04:07** that was good for me until we were in a point

**00:04:10** where we could buy our own home.

**00:04:12** And so being in this kind of environment now,

**00:04:16** it's like, it's a bit weird.

**00:04:17** It's like, we wanna fix something.

**00:04:19** Well, you can't fix it.

**00:04:20** You have to get the landlord to fix it.

**00:04:22** And so there's all these little things.

**00:04:24** So it's like, oh, you wanna replace the window.

**00:04:26** You can't do that.

**00:04:28** Okay, will you replace the window?

**00:04:29** No, there's nothing wrong with it.

**00:04:31** It's like, yeah, I know, but we would like a different kind

**00:04:35** of lock on the window.

**00:04:36** Oh, no, no, no, it's fine.

**00:04:38** This is stuff like that.

**00:04:40** I think that's gonna be a long-term goal.

**00:04:42** It'll probably be in a yearly theme at some point

**00:04:44** in the future, within the next couple of years, maybe.

**00:04:47** And it's like, one of those things we look,

**00:04:48** like see what's available.

**00:04:50** And most commercial property stuff in our area

**00:04:53** is all retail and you can't just buy a shop

**00:04:57** and not be a shop.

**00:04:58** Like it's not how it works.

**00:05:00** And office space seems hard to come by.

**00:05:02** Yes, yeah, I looked into that at one point.

**00:05:05** I was like, oh, commercial real estate.

**00:05:07** This is interesting.

**00:05:08** Oh, no, I can't do what I want.

**00:05:10** Can I set up like a fake shop in the front?

**00:05:12** You know, it's like the office equivalent

**00:05:14** of money laundering.

**00:05:15** I was like, oh, that's the coffee shop.

**00:05:17** It's only three feet deep in that retail space.

**00:05:19** What's behind there?

**00:05:20** Oh, nothing.

**00:05:21** You know, it's just an office space.

**00:05:23** That reminds me of that 368, the Casey Neistat setup.

**00:05:26** They had a little shop in the front.

**00:05:28** It just made me realize.

**00:05:29** Was that because of zoning laws?

**00:05:31** Boy, you know, that's an interesting,

**00:05:34** I mean, look, a lot of interesting questions around 368.

**00:05:39** But that's a very interesting question.

**00:05:42** Maybe we could just set up a very tiny Cortex brand store

**00:05:48** that is open for half an hour every three months.

**00:05:51** Right.

**00:05:52** And just the rest of it is very selective

**00:05:54** and the rest of the time it's closed.

**00:05:56** But then we have these wonderful offices behind it.

**00:05:58** What's the minimum amount of retail that would count?

**00:06:01** Could you have a like a buy appointment

**00:06:04** only shopping experience?

**00:06:06** Why not?

**00:06:08** I don't know.

**00:06:09** I do feel like us talking about it here

**00:06:11** makes it harder for us to realize this dream.

**00:06:17** I'm not sure about that, Mike.

**00:06:18** Just because we're talking about office space laundering.

**00:06:22** It's like, I think it's why.

**00:06:23** Our podcast, Admissible in Court is what I wanna know.

**00:06:27** Judge, I was just joking.

**00:06:29** I don't understand why you took that section so seriously.

**00:06:31** It's a comedy podcast by and large.

**00:06:34** Yeah, but it's a comedy podcast.

**00:06:35** None of your words count.

**00:06:37** Everyone knows that.

**00:06:39** So yeah, I'm very happy here,

**00:06:42** but as always thinking about what my future will look like.

**00:06:46** But I do feel very wedded to the idea

**00:06:48** of an out of home office.

**00:06:50** I really do like that experience.

**00:06:52** It's been a very nice adjustment for me.

**00:06:54** Yeah, I just think it's funny that you have only just

**00:06:57** brought over the last piece of equipment

**00:06:58** and already I'm hearing about, well,

**00:07:01** and then the next place is on the horizon already.

**00:07:04** Yeah, I mean, this was always step one.

**00:07:07** I had just decided I had to be out of the home

**00:07:11** and we basically went for the first place we found,

**00:07:16** which is honestly not that different

**00:07:18** to when we bought our apartment.

**00:07:21** It was like, we wanna move, we have to move now.

**00:07:24** We spent one day, we looked at four apartments

**00:07:26** and then we just put an offer on one of them.

**00:07:29** I should realize it was that fast.

**00:07:30** Yeah, I mean, but then it took an awful long time

**00:07:32** to complete.

**00:07:33** I feel like I'm with this kind of stuff realistic

**00:07:36** in knowing that they don't need to be dream homes

**00:07:39** because I feel like the dream home

**00:07:43** or the dream office comes later in life.

**00:07:45** It's not the first one, or at least it's not gonna be for me.

**00:07:49** I'm just not, I don't live in that part of the world, right?

**00:07:52** Like if I wanna stay in London, I can't get the dream.

**00:07:56** It's gonna take a long time

**00:07:57** and I'm gonna have to move somewhere different probably,

**00:08:00** but I also don't know what it would be.

**00:08:02** But like this has been a very good test case

**00:08:04** of understanding what I want.

**00:08:06** And I think the main thing now that we know we want is

**00:08:10** we need rooms, there needs to be dividing walls in the space.

**00:08:14** Right, so not just setting up zones for different things,

**00:08:17** different spaces in one big open space.

**00:08:19** You want physically separate rooms.

**00:08:21** And so that's like a thing for the future

**00:08:23** is like if and when we do this, rooms will be key.

**00:08:27** I wish you luck on your search.

**00:08:29** Oh, I'm not sure. Two years hence.

**00:08:31** Many, you can wish future Mike some good luck.

**00:08:35** I'm not in a rush, I'm not in a rush.

**00:08:38** Gonna set some homework for the next episode.

**00:08:40** We haven't done a book club in a while

**00:08:41** and I'm realizing where we are in the year.

**00:08:46** And if we don't do one now,

**00:08:48** cause I did really wanna do one this year,

**00:08:50** but don't do one now,

**00:08:51** I don't think we're gonna be able to do it.

**00:08:53** Because I think I was talking to Adina about this yesterday

**00:08:56** that we maybe have like five more episodes

**00:08:58** and like three of them are set, like the topics are set.

**00:09:00** Oh God, Mike, you're making my whole year

**00:09:02** feel like it's just slipped away.

**00:09:05** It really is wild when you think about that.

**00:09:08** It's like you do like maybe somewhere

**00:09:09** between 12 and 14 episodes a year.

**00:09:11** But it's only March now,

**00:09:13** like it can't possibly be that far into the years.

**00:09:15** I feel like I have something terrible to break to you,

**00:09:17** but maybe we'll deal with that later on.

**00:09:19** So we wanted to do a book club.

**00:09:21** We're gonna do something we haven't done before.

**00:09:24** Neither of us have read this book.

**00:09:26** So we don't know what it's gonna be like,

**00:09:28** but it is one that I've had recommended to us

**00:09:30** every time we talk about book recommendations.

**00:09:34** This one always comes up.

**00:09:35** So there's probably a reason for that.

**00:09:37** And it is Thinking Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman.

**00:09:42** Is that how you say it, Kahneman?

**00:09:44** I think it's Kahneman.

**00:09:45** Kahneman.

**00:09:46** I'm not 100% sure on that either.

**00:09:47** But this also is one of these books

**00:09:48** where when we were looking through potential options,

**00:09:52** it's definitely a book.

**00:09:53** I've heard lots of people make reference to

**00:09:56** and people have recommended to me.

**00:09:58** So I've been aware of it for a long time.

**00:10:00** I've just never gotten around to reading it.

**00:10:04** It's also one of these books that I feel like

**00:10:05** I think I might never read this

**00:10:07** unless we do do it as homework for book club.

**00:10:10** So yeah, we're gonna-

**00:10:11** That's the same thing with all of these books.

**00:10:14** I will never read them unless they're set as a task

**00:10:17** I must complete because I've promised people

**00:10:19** I would have read it.

**00:10:20** Right, I guess I've forgotten for you

**00:10:22** that that is the case for literally every one of these books.

**00:10:25** Literally every book.

**00:10:25** And not every book, these are all books.

**00:10:29** I'm looking at the cover of this now on Audible,

**00:10:31** this book, and it's fun to me.

**00:10:32** So it says the international bestseller,

**00:10:34** Thinking Fast and Slow,

**00:10:36** Daniel Kahneman, winner of the Nobel Prize.

**00:10:38** So Kahneman is a Nobel Prize winning economic scientist,

**00:10:42** but putting it on the book kind of makes it seem like

**00:10:45** if you're not paying attention

**00:10:47** that he won a Nobel Prize for this book.

**00:10:49** Right.

**00:10:50** This book is a Nobel Prize winning book.

**00:10:53** Peace on earth because of Thinking Fast and Slow.

**00:10:56** Yeah, so my understanding is it is a book

**00:10:58** about decision making in general,

**00:11:01** how do humans make decisions?

**00:11:03** And so I feel like that very easily fits in

**00:11:05** with our book club.

**00:11:07** So yeah, and I will be happy in the future

**00:11:10** to have actually been able to say like, oh yes,

**00:11:13** I've read that book and I have thoughts on it

**00:11:15** the next time it comes up in conversation.

**00:11:17** So you have about a month if you want to follow along

**00:11:20** because that will be on our next episode.

**00:11:23** Yep.

**00:11:23** Get started people.

**00:11:24** It's 20 hours on Audible.

**00:11:26** Ah.

**00:11:27** I'm definitely not going to read it on the Kindle.

**00:11:32** I'm not going to put myself through that again.

**00:11:33** I'm going to listen to it.

**00:11:34** I forgot.

**00:11:34** What was the book that you tried to read on the Kindle?

**00:11:37** Which one?

**00:11:38** You made yourself really miserable with one of the books.

**00:11:40** You actually tried to read it and I was like, oh no.

**00:11:43** Which one?

**00:11:44** Hold on.

**00:11:45** Let me log into my Amazon account maybe.

**00:11:47** Is it the effective executive?

**00:11:48** What is that?

**00:11:49** Did we read that?

**00:11:50** I don't even know anymore.

**00:11:51** What is that book?

**00:11:52** Maybe we've been doing the book club for too long.

**00:11:54** I have no memory of this.

**00:11:56** From November, 2018.

**00:11:58** I have zero memory of this book.

**00:12:01** That's terrible.

**00:12:02** I don't remember it at all.

**00:12:05** By Peter Drucker.

**00:12:07** Five talents is essential to effectiveness.

**00:12:10** This must've been one of the really bad ones,

**00:12:12** but like not even in a good way.

**00:12:15** I have zero memory of this book.

**00:12:16** I remember many of the others.

**00:12:19** Like I remember Creativity Inc.

**00:12:20** I remember when we did Emith and Seven Habits.

**00:12:24** I remember all of those.

**00:12:25** I remember nothing about the effective executive.

**00:12:27** So probably not that effective.

**00:12:29** The unaffected executive.

**00:12:30** This is not a very popular business book.

**00:12:33** This episode of Cortex is brought to you by FitBod,

**00:14:42** You seemed to be kicking yourself a little bit

**00:14:44** in the subreddit thread for the last episode.

**00:14:48** No, no, no, don't forget to drop a...

**00:14:51** Oh no.

**00:14:52** You seemed upset at yourself

**00:14:54** in the way that you explained magic.

**00:14:58** No, no, I...

**00:15:01** Look, listen listeners,

**00:15:02** if you're ever in a position

**00:15:03** where you have to explain something

**00:15:05** then you have to listen to a recording of yourself

**00:15:08** explaining a thing.

**00:15:09** I guarantee you that 100% of the time

**00:15:13** you will be unhappy with that recording.

**00:15:15** Like you'll go, oh, I thought I was doing a great job

**00:15:18** and then you hear yourself

**00:15:19** and you go, that was terrible.

**00:15:21** And I feel that after literally every one of the shows,

**00:15:25** every time I listened to the recording, I'm always going,

**00:15:29** oh, why didn't he explain his thoughts more clearly?

**00:15:33** But I don't think I can even do this,

**00:15:35** but we talked about magic for a while last time.

**00:15:41** And I think I have never been more uncomfortable

**00:15:43** listening to an audio recording of myself.

**00:15:45** I'm like, oh God, I'm just doing the worst job

**00:15:48** explaining this ever.

**00:15:49** So I'll just rank this up as like, oh my God,

**00:15:52** I was incredibly uncomfortable with that segment.

**00:15:55** I just thought I did a terrible job.

**00:15:57** But I don't know,

**00:15:58** the feedback seemed to be reasonably positive

**00:16:01** and people liked it anyway.

**00:16:02** So I think people were just excited

**00:16:04** that we spoke about it more than anything else.

**00:16:06** Yeah, maybe that's what it was.

**00:16:08** All of the magic players in the audience are like,

**00:16:10** oh my God, Grey's talking about it.

**00:16:12** But honestly, I think I would die

**00:16:15** if I tried to do it again.

**00:16:17** So we could just put that in follow up of like,

**00:16:22** OMG, that was incredibly uncomfortable for Grey.

**00:16:25** I just did a terrible job.

**00:16:26** I don't know why.

**00:16:28** And when I was listening to that editing,

**00:16:30** I caught myself starting to like make notes

**00:16:33** for like a script of,

**00:16:35** well, here's how I would explain it better.

**00:16:36** And then I was like, what the fuck are you doing?

**00:16:38** I'm gonna delete it that straight away.

**00:16:41** I'm like, this is done, all right?

**00:16:46** This is done.

**00:16:47** You don't need to have another go at this.

**00:16:51** We can just let it lay at rest forever.

**00:16:54** And it's like, Grey still plays a lot of magic.

**00:16:57** He totally loves it.

**00:16:58** But he doesn't need to try to make a second go

**00:17:01** at explaining why.

**00:17:03** So you are continuing to play.

**00:17:04** It's still your game of choice at the moment.

**00:17:06** Oh yeah, totally.

**00:17:07** I still completely, completely love it.

**00:17:09** I've been playing a lot of magic on the couch,

**00:17:12** you know, while my wife is watching TV

**00:17:14** and it's fantastic.

**00:17:18** How are you feeling with your work patterns right now?

**00:17:24** I feel like this has been something we've touched on

**00:17:27** various times during pandemic season.

**00:17:32** You know, like we were a bit all over the place at the start

**00:17:34** and then you brought weekend Wednesday into the picture.

**00:17:38** Yeah.

**00:17:39** How are things right now?

**00:17:45** Yeah, it's interesting.

**00:17:46** I was kind of thinking about this a bunch.

**00:17:49** This pandemic year has been an interesting one.

**00:17:53** Although now we are very well into the pandemic year

**00:17:56** and a half is really what we're approaching up on.

**00:18:00** Even though in my head, I do still feel like it's March,

**00:18:03** but things like there's only five episodes left

**00:18:06** in the year really go, no, no, we're very well into 2021.

**00:18:12** Mike, do you know the Twitter account,

**00:18:15** it's called something like year percentage.

**00:18:18** Do you know this Twitter account?

**00:18:18** I've seen it.

**00:18:19** It's like an account that fills up a progress bar, right?

**00:18:23** Yeah, it fills up a progress bar over the course of a year.

**00:18:26** So every day it just has one tweet and it says like,

**00:18:28** we are with a little bar, 10% of the way through the year.

**00:18:32** And I don't log on Twitter very much, but whenever I do,

**00:18:35** it tends to be one of the top ones.

**00:18:38** And it must be because Twitter knows

**00:18:40** that like my mouse cursor always hovers over it in horror.

**00:18:44** Like, oh, he really engages with that tweet.

**00:18:46** Because there's something just totally shocking

**00:18:49** about seeing how fast the year has gone.

**00:18:52** And there's something about that progress bar one

**00:18:54** that really gets me every time.

**00:18:56** 51% Gray.

**00:18:58** Oh no, really?

**00:18:59** We've lost it, yeah.

**00:19:01** We're over 51% now.

**00:19:03** I literally cannot believe that.

**00:19:05** That's like, I know what the date is, right?

**00:19:08** But still, right?

**00:19:09** But still.

**00:19:14** Oh my God, that's awful.

**00:19:16** So yeah, we're officially into like 18 months

**00:19:19** of pandemic time.

**00:19:22** So yeah, I think it's, there's been a lot,

**00:19:25** like sort of nothing has changed over the course

**00:19:28** of this time, but also there's been so much change.

**00:19:31** And I think the way that I would describe the past,

**00:19:36** I guess, two months.

**00:19:38** Oh my God, Gray.

**00:19:40** I just got lost on his Twitter account.

**00:19:41** They make a Mac app, a menu bar app.

**00:19:44** Oh yeah?

**00:19:45** That shows percentage of day, month, year,

**00:19:47** and you can also put life in, which is horrifying.

**00:19:51** So there's like, so the people that make that account,

**00:19:54** they have an app for the Mac, which does this.

**00:19:57** I've just sent it to you.

**00:19:59** I was like, you need to send me this link also.

**00:20:02** I don't know if this is a good idea.

**00:20:04** Oh, so the one that's life,

**00:20:05** you can choose your own deadline.

**00:20:06** They put life in there,

**00:20:07** because I guess that's kind of funny, but.

**00:20:09** Yeah, you're a deadline with death.

**00:20:10** It's actually quite a cute little app actually.

**00:20:12** Oh man.

**00:20:14** I think I'm,

**00:20:19** God damn it, Mike.

**00:20:20** This is one of these things where I am not going to be able

**00:20:23** to resist installing this.

**00:20:25** Oh, I've just bought it.

**00:20:26** And I'm going to hate it every day.

**00:20:28** I just bought it.

**00:20:29** I own it now.

**00:20:30** Yeah.

**00:20:31** Okay, great.

**00:20:32** Are you gonna put your life in there

**00:20:33** or are you gonna put the year in there?

**00:20:34** I don't know what I'm gonna put in there.

**00:20:36** Maybe now I'm gonna put in fully vaccinated.

**00:20:42** I think I might put that in there.

**00:20:43** That's much more cheerful.

**00:20:44** I have that with Widget Smith.

**00:20:45** I have a page of Widget Smith right now

**00:20:48** where there's three countdown widgets.

**00:20:50** I have a page on my home screen.

**00:20:52** One is countdown to my second jab.

**00:20:55** Then it's countdown to fully vaccinated.

**00:20:58** And then countdown to a hopeful holiday

**00:21:03** that we would like to take.

**00:21:04** How confident are you feeling about that?

**00:21:09** You gotta give me odds here, Mike.

**00:21:10** Percentages.

**00:21:12** 55.

**00:21:14** 55% that you will take the vacation?

**00:21:16** Yeah, it's going down though.

**00:21:18** It's going down though, okay.

**00:21:19** It's going down.

**00:21:22** So the vacation that we wanna take,

**00:21:24** we wanna go to Hawaii.

**00:21:25** Right.

**00:21:26** And things are moving in some level of favor for us.

**00:21:31** Cause Hawaii had its own completely separate.

**00:21:34** You've got a test process like then the rest of America.

**00:21:38** No, Hawaii was not screwing around.

**00:21:40** No, I'm not gonna say, great, you go for it Hawaii.

**00:21:43** But they've actually just changed it.

**00:21:44** So now all you need to do

**00:21:45** is just prove your vaccinated status, right?

**00:21:48** So some things are improving.

**00:21:50** The issue we have right now is just legally,

**00:21:52** I cannot go to America.

**00:21:55** Oh, right.

**00:21:56** That's the issue.

**00:21:57** Right, I forget this.

**00:21:58** As a non-US citizen, I legally cannot go.

**00:22:02** So.

**00:22:04** That's gonna mess it up.

**00:22:05** That's really gonna kind of mess it up.

**00:22:07** Yeah, that's gonna be a problem.

**00:22:13** If you wanna take a trip to Hawaii, for sure.

**00:22:17** That's gonna get in your way.

**00:22:22** I mean, I could go for you,

**00:22:23** but we all know how I feel about Hawaii.

**00:22:25** So I'll pass on that.

**00:22:28** So that's why your percentage is creeping down day by day.

**00:22:32** Because there's zero news on it.

**00:22:34** Right, yeah.

**00:22:35** I'm sorry, I'm sorry to hear that.

**00:22:38** It's only at 55%.

**00:22:41** But this is like, okay.

**00:22:42** But so this is you have encapsulated exactly

**00:22:45** how I have been feeling for the past two months,

**00:22:48** which is in my head, I finally coalesced this under,

**00:22:52** oh, I've been living in the season of uncertainty.

**00:22:56** That's what the past couple of months have been.

**00:22:59** And some kinds of uncertainty are easy to deal with,

**00:23:03** but I have found the current types of uncertainty

**00:23:06** in all areas of my life, just infuriating and frustrating

**00:23:09** and very difficult to deal with.

**00:23:11** Yeah, I think we got used,

**00:23:14** so there was like a lot of uncertainty, right?

**00:23:16** Like we were dealing with just an obscene amount

**00:23:18** of uncertainty for a long time.

**00:23:21** Then it felt like things kind of calmed down for a while

**00:23:24** and it felt like I know what this is all about, you know,

**00:23:29** we just got a hunker down, settle in.

**00:23:31** Yeah, and also I would say like my experience

**00:23:33** at the beginning was what I mean by like different kinds

**00:23:36** of uncertainty, my feeling at the start was, okay,

**00:23:39** there is a lot of uncertainty about the pandemic,

**00:23:43** but I am very certain that I'm not going outside, right?

**00:23:47** So like there's a way in which that's very easy

**00:23:50** to deal with, like, cool, I'm just gonna stay here.

**00:23:55** You're totally right.

**00:23:56** Like things did level out eventually into just,

**00:24:01** this is the routine of life, but even at the start,

**00:24:04** when uncertainty was high, I still felt like

**00:24:06** this is uncertainty that I can deal with very easily.

**00:24:09** Like I, my personality is tailor made

**00:24:12** for this kind of uncertainty because part of it is certain.

**00:24:15** I think now that we're in the reverse of that,

**00:24:19** the coming out uncertainty,

**00:24:21** I just find 10 times more frustrating in every possible way.

**00:24:29** And also all of the things in my work life have conspired

**00:24:33** to be uncertain, difficult things to deal with as well.

**00:24:37** I don't know how you're doing, but I just,

**00:24:39** I find the planning, any kind of planning is just killing me.

**00:24:45** Yeah, yeah.

**00:24:46** I don't think we talked about it on the show

**00:24:48** or maybe I mentioned it in more texts briefly,

**00:24:50** but it like, it even just started with trying

**00:24:54** to get my vaccine ended up being just a real nightmare

**00:24:58** of a process for like reasons I will not totally go into

**00:25:02** because it's just nobody cares that much,

**00:25:04** but I had messed up NHS records.

**00:25:06** And so I just wasn't able to book a vaccine appointment.

**00:25:10** And they were like, well, we'll see

**00:25:12** if we can fix that in the system.

**00:25:14** Who, who's the we, when?

**00:25:17** And they literally would tell me like, I don't know,

**00:25:19** come back in a week and we'll see if it's fixed.

**00:25:22** Which starts nicely.

**00:25:23** Yeah, like who would have been fixing it?

**00:25:25** Like I don't even understand.

**00:25:26** Like I totally know you're either trying

**00:25:28** to get me off the phone or when I went to my doctor

**00:25:31** to pester them in person, like you're trying

**00:25:33** to get me out of this office.

**00:25:34** Like nothing's going to happen.

**00:25:36** I did eventually get that solved

**00:25:39** like a weird shenanigans kind of way, but like whatever.

**00:25:41** So even just that of like, can I even get this vaccine

**00:25:44** was incredibly uncertain and it like threw off

**00:25:47** all my timelines and then just like with your trip,

**00:25:53** I've had a bunch of these things that are existing

**00:25:55** out in the future timeline of like,

**00:25:58** oh, maybe this will happen.

**00:25:59** It's like, oh, there was a conference

**00:26:01** that was supposed to happen that I was really kind

**00:26:02** of looking forward to.

**00:26:03** And it just kind of kept getting inched back

**00:26:06** and inched back of like, oh, it won't quite happen now.

**00:26:09** Maybe not quite happen now.

**00:26:10** And then suddenly, bam, four months in the future.

**00:26:13** It's like, oh my God, all of that stuff.

**00:26:16** I just, I find so psychologically hard to deal with

**00:26:22** in a way that like, I know it's disproportionate

**00:26:25** because nothing in my life has actually changed

**00:26:28** on a day to day basis.

**00:26:30** But this is definitely the part

**00:26:32** that I just have a much harder time with.

**00:26:35** I just, I like to know, okay, when am I going to be traveling

**00:26:41** if it's on the horizon?

**00:26:43** And when am I going to go see my family in America?

**00:26:47** It's been in my head under this vague category of soon,

**00:26:51** dot, dot, dot, right?

**00:26:53** But even now, as we currently record,

**00:26:55** there's a lot of questions about this new variant

**00:26:57** that seems to be spreading like wild.

**00:26:59** And it's like, oh, okay, you know, Mike, don't count

**00:27:04** on the borders opening up anytime soon

**00:27:06** to anyone from the UK going anywhere.

**00:27:10** So yeah, I don't know about you, but like,

**00:27:12** I've just found that really hard to deal with.

**00:27:14** It bizarrely just like disrupts my regular time

**00:27:18** in a way that it totally shouldn't, but it just, it does.

**00:27:22** Like it puts me in a weird kind of mental chaos.

**00:27:26** It was easier when it was harder in a way.

**00:27:30** Like, mentally it points, I was able to kind of resign

**00:27:35** myself to this is just it for a long time, right?

**00:27:40** Like an unknowable amount of time, like back in the time

**00:27:43** when people were like, hey, there might not be a vaccine

**00:27:47** for four years or whatever, right?

**00:27:49** Like, which is pretty early on.

**00:27:51** And that was like, it freaking sucked,

**00:27:54** but I felt like it was at least like, well, I'm in this.

**00:27:57** This is it.

**00:27:57** This is what I'm in.

**00:28:00** And it is that like, you feel like it's on the horizon,

**00:28:06** but then the horizon just keeps moving.

**00:28:09** Like we had this, like when we were waiting

**00:28:11** to get our first shot, which was, it felt like it was

**00:28:16** for about six weeks, it was always gonna be by the end

**00:28:20** the next week.

**00:28:21** Like it just felt like surely it's gonna be by the end

**00:28:24** the next week that we'll be able to book.

**00:28:26** Oh no, oh okay.

**00:28:27** Next week though, right?

**00:28:28** Like, no, all right then.

**00:28:30** Like it just felt like that kept going on and on and on

**00:28:32** for a while.

**00:28:33** And now it's like, okay, we now know the day that we will

**00:28:37** be like fully vaccinated, but that kind of doesn't mean

**00:28:40** anything.

**00:28:41** Just like you might be able to do all the things you want

**00:28:46** to do, but does the rest of the world think you can

**00:28:48** or should?

**00:28:49** Yeah.

**00:28:50** We'll find out.

**00:28:52** Yeah, it's a weird thing to say, but it totally is true

**00:28:56** that I, you know, rewind two months ago and I started

**00:29:00** to have the feeling of like, oh, this is all gonna be

**00:29:02** over soon, cool.

**00:29:03** I can start making plans.

**00:29:05** And then like, just like your trip to Hawaii day by day

**00:29:09** by like, oh, I'm 90% confident that this will all be

**00:29:12** over soon.

**00:29:13** I'm 89% confident this will all be over soon.

**00:29:17** I'm 88% confident.

**00:29:19** Oh, and a thing got canceled that I was planning on.

**00:29:21** Oh, okay.

**00:29:22** Well, so then that's not gonna happen.

**00:29:23** That changes everything.

**00:29:25** 82% confident, like, God damn it.

**00:29:28** This is so much worse.

**00:29:30** Yeah.

**00:29:30** You know, where is it?

**00:29:32** Where is it at the start where people were talking about,

**00:29:35** we'll have a vaccine soon.

**00:29:36** I was like, what are you crazy?

**00:29:37** I give it a 1% chance we'll have a vaccine in five years.

**00:29:41** It's like, I was way wrong, but that kind of planning

**00:29:44** is much simpler.

**00:29:45** The one way I try and console myself a little bit

**00:29:48** is like things change and have been changing so fast

**00:29:51** in all directions.

**00:29:52** Yeah.

**00:29:53** Right.

**00:29:54** So it's like, it does feel like it's a bit bleaker

**00:29:58** at the moment, especially in the UK, it feels a little bit

**00:30:01** bleaker right now, no matter what everyone else

**00:30:04** seems to be saying.

**00:30:08** But things, they swing in all directions.

**00:30:11** And it is that like, I remember the vaccine, right?

**00:30:14** Where it was like, everyone just had their own opinion

**00:30:16** as to whether it was gonna happen or not of anytime soon.

**00:30:18** And I remember I was a bit more optimistic than you.

**00:30:20** We would talk about this, right?

**00:30:23** But it was still like, there was just for a long time,

**00:30:26** like, all right, we've got people working on it,

**00:30:27** but who knows?

**00:30:29** And it ended up, I think, exceeding people's expectations

**00:30:32** and time of when these things would be available.

**00:30:36** And that was a, you know, it's great and it's working great

**00:30:38** and everyone should get one.

**00:30:40** And, you know, it's awesome.

**00:30:42** But now it just feels like it's closing in again.

**00:32:23** A thanks to Squarespace for their support

**00:32:24** of Cortex and Relay FM.

**00:32:27** So the reason that I'm calling this like the season

**00:32:30** of uncertainty though, is because it's just been like,

**00:32:35** you know, you ask how I'm doing work wise

**00:32:37** and it's like work wise, these past two months

**00:32:40** have just been the worst of the last 18 months.

**00:32:45** And it's because the uncertainty of the outside world

**00:32:48** has also conspired with the uncertainty of just like

**00:32:52** the stuff that I'm working on.

**00:32:53** And it's just, it's been so infuriating.

**00:32:57** I was trying to look over my video catalog earlier today

**00:33:00** and I was thinking about the last classic Gray Explains

**00:33:07** kind of video that went up was the metric paper video

**00:33:10** a while ago.

**00:33:11** And that video was a big project.

**00:33:14** And after that went up, I was very conscious about,

**00:33:18** you know what I'm gonna do?

**00:33:19** I'm gonna pick a couple nice easy videos.

**00:33:22** Now, of course, I know that I always think this

**00:33:25** and I also know that I'm very frequently wrong

**00:33:28** about what will be an easy video.

**00:33:31** I actually had a friend basically laugh in my face

**00:33:33** the other day when I told them about like,

**00:33:35** oh, I'm gonna do this thing and it's gonna be an easy thing.

**00:33:37** And he's like, do you know how many times I've heard that?

**00:33:39** I should have picked an easy video.

**00:33:42** It's like two years later,

**00:33:43** you're still working on that thing.

**00:33:44** Like I know that this is just a thing that happens,

**00:33:47** but looking over my video catalog,

**00:33:50** I think I can confidently say

**00:33:53** that I have never been more wrong twice in a row

**00:33:59** about this will be an easy video.

**00:34:02** And it's the sharks video.

**00:34:04** And then it's the one that I'm currently working on

**00:34:06** trying to finish, which I was maybe one of the most

**00:34:10** confident I've ever been would be like,

**00:34:12** oh, this will be a nice simple video.

**00:34:14** Look, this topic is already well known

**00:34:17** and you can just write your take on this little thing.

**00:34:20** And then it has exploded into literally going through

**00:34:25** hundreds of pages of medieval documents.

**00:34:29** It's like, oh no.

**00:34:31** Do you not do this to yourself though?

**00:34:33** Like, did you have to go that far?

**00:34:35** Like if everyone knows about it and it's simple,

**00:34:37** like why not just restrain yourself?

**00:34:40** Okay, okay.

**00:34:41** You know why, Mike?

**00:34:42** Do you wanna know why you have to go this far?

**00:34:44** Because look,

**00:34:45** because the abyss of what is true lies underneath

**00:34:54** every page of every book.

**00:34:57** And this is also why it's been the season of uncertainty.

**00:35:04** Like I've complained about this kind of stuff before,

**00:35:07** but you think like, what is true?

**00:35:12** How do we know that a piece of information is true?

**00:35:16** And part of the reason why these things always explode

**00:35:18** into much bigger projects, or I should say very frequently,

**00:35:22** sharks exploded into a whole other thing

**00:35:24** for different sorts of reasons.

**00:35:26** But the current thing that I'm working on is totally like,

**00:35:29** what is true explosion?

**00:35:31** Because I can't just let it go,

**00:35:33** because I'll read about a topic

**00:35:34** and there'll be some sentence and you'll go,

**00:35:37** huh, that's really interesting.

**00:35:39** And then one of two things pops into your head.

**00:35:42** How do they know that sentence?

**00:35:44** Or I would like to know more information

**00:35:47** about that sentence.

**00:35:48** And that's all you need to start falling into the abyss

**00:35:52** of wait, how does anybody know anything?

**00:35:55** And you just like, okay, let me give you an example.

**00:36:00** This will need to be a little bit abstract

**00:36:01** because I don't wanna give away the topic,

**00:36:02** but I think I can make it clear enough.

**00:36:04** So I'm trying to track down when was the first time

**00:36:10** a thing happened, right?

**00:36:12** You go like, okay, things happen.

**00:36:13** When was the first time this thing happened?

**00:36:17** And there are a bunch of articles that will go like,

**00:36:19** oh, this thing happened in the Middle Ages.

**00:36:23** Oh, that's interesting.

**00:36:24** When?

**00:36:24** When in the Middle Ages?

**00:36:25** The Middle Ages is a range of time that's like 600 years wide.

**00:36:30** So what year in the Middle Ages?

**00:36:33** How do you know?

**00:36:34** When did this occur?

**00:36:35** And so you start to try to track it down.

**00:36:38** And when you try to track it down,

**00:36:41** you immediately will run into references that go nowhere

**00:36:45** or references that don't say the thing

**00:36:47** that the original article says that it says,

**00:36:50** which is always a particular delight,

**00:36:52** especially on places like Wikipedia.

**00:36:54** I find it horrifying how many times you click the link

**00:36:56** that's the citation link is like,

**00:36:58** the webpage doesn't even mention the thing

**00:37:00** that this is citing.

**00:37:01** Like, okay, I don't know how this citation got here,

**00:37:04** but it looks like in school

**00:37:06** when I would just fraudulently populate citations

**00:37:09** in my essays after I finished writing the essay.

**00:37:11** You know, I was like, oh, the teacher needs citations.

**00:37:13** I'm gonna bet they're not gonna check my citations.

**00:37:15** So whatever, you know, here's just a bunch of stuff.

**00:37:19** So as an example, just trying to track down

**00:37:22** one thing in history, when did this happen?

**00:37:25** When was the first appearance of this thing?

**00:37:28** Find that it's supposed to be sourced in this book

**00:37:32** that's in the Middle Ages.

**00:37:33** It's like, oh, okay, cool.

**00:37:35** We'll track down this book.

**00:37:38** But you can't find any originals of the book.

**00:37:40** It turns out the originals of the book

**00:37:42** like don't really exist anymore.

**00:37:44** And what you have, the only thing that exists

**00:37:47** in the modern world is like an annotated version

**00:37:51** that some guy in the 1700s wrote.

**00:37:54** And the thing that's supposed to have happened

**00:37:57** in the Middle Ages isn't in the book at all.

**00:38:00** It's actually in a note that the editor made

**00:38:03** in the 1700s.

**00:38:06** And so this is the problem.

**00:38:08** You go, oh, wait a minute.

**00:38:10** So all of these places that say this thing happened

**00:38:12** in the Middle Ages, the source that they're pointing to

**00:38:15** never mentioned it.

**00:38:17** It actually didn't show up until some dude

**00:38:19** like annotated the book hundreds of years later.

**00:38:22** And just like, this is why I have particularly

**00:38:27** such a hard time with history

**00:38:30** because I cannot tell you how often this occurs

**00:38:34** where it's like, where did this come from?

**00:38:36** A person said it.

**00:38:37** Where did they say it?

**00:38:38** They said it in this book and you go to that book.

**00:38:40** Oh, somebody else said it is what that book said.

**00:38:42** Oh, okay, cool.

**00:38:43** Let me find that book.

**00:38:44** Oh yeah, a guy told me.

**00:38:46** Great, who's the guy?

**00:38:48** Oh, I don't know.

**00:38:49** When did he tell you?

**00:38:50** Oh, this is the primary source

**00:38:52** and it's 100 years after the event occurred.

**00:38:55** Fantastic.

**00:38:56** It's just like, I've really fallen down another one

**00:38:59** of these frustrating holes.

**00:39:00** And this is why it can't be easy

**00:39:04** because then what happens is, okay, sure.

**00:39:08** I could write another one of like this topic,

**00:39:12** like several people have written little articles about it.

**00:39:14** It's why I thought it would be nice and easy.

**00:39:17** Sure, I could write a little script

**00:39:19** that covers the same kinds of things

**00:39:22** except that I would know now

**00:39:23** that it's full of total fucking bullshits

**00:39:25** that like the things that they're referencing

**00:39:27** just aren't true

**00:39:28** because I bothered to try to look.

**00:39:32** Like that's the thing that kills me.

**00:39:33** Right, but see, I understand where you came from.

**00:39:36** But you can stop though, right?

**00:39:38** Like you, because you can-

**00:39:39** I cannot look, right?

**00:39:41** That's what you're saying.

**00:39:42** No, no, no, you could be like, you could look so far,

**00:39:44** realize you're going down one of these holes, stop that.

**00:39:47** And then when you're in the script to say, it is said,

**00:39:49** it is, you know, you could,

**00:39:51** but I know you don't wanna do that.

**00:39:52** That's the coward way, right?

**00:39:54** That's so cowardly.

**00:39:56** If I would say efficient,

**00:39:58** because ultimately when you get into one of those situations,

**00:40:01** it doesn't matter anymore anyway.

**00:40:03** Cause like, how would you ever find the true,

**00:40:05** the actual answer?

**00:40:06** Like once you start down one of these rabbit holes,

**00:40:10** then you can't trust anything.

**00:40:11** So like, why would you ever get to a point

**00:40:13** where you're able to trust something?

**00:40:15** Well, at this point,

**00:40:17** me and my assistant who has done a tremendous amount of work

**00:40:22** in multiple languages, I'll just comment on this topic.

**00:40:26** I think we have found the answer.

**00:40:28** And so that's why, right?

**00:40:30** Maybe sometimes you can actually find an answer.

**00:40:32** You think? To a thing.

**00:40:33** Yes, I'll put it this way.

**00:40:35** At the very least,

**00:40:36** we've been able to establish a very early date

**00:40:40** for when is the first time this thing occurred.

**00:40:42** It's like, great.

**00:40:44** Right, so this is the problem.

**00:40:46** It makes me think a lot about,

**00:40:48** it's just a general problem of knowledge work, right?

**00:40:52** That you can't estimate very well at all

**00:40:56** how long a knowledge work project will take.

**00:41:01** And I think that can be something like writing.

**00:41:03** It can be something like programming.

**00:41:05** There's lots of jobs like this where you go,

**00:41:07** oh, how long will it take?

**00:41:08** Well, it might take two weeks if everything goes right.

**00:41:11** But if it doesn't go right, it might take two years.

**00:41:14** And there's just no good way to know ahead of time

**00:41:17** when that's going to occur.

**00:41:20** I think I have learned a little bit of a lesson

**00:41:23** from this one, which I've tried to formalize

**00:41:27** as a policy within my company, which is, hey, everyone.

**00:41:31** The next time I say, this topic is going to be easy.

**00:41:36** If the topic in any way at all is related to history,

**00:41:42** tell me no, why can't I not allowed to do that?

**00:41:45** Well, this is a minute ago, I was gonna say to you,

**00:41:48** if you have this problem,

**00:41:49** why do you make history-focused videos?

**00:41:51** If you don't like dealing with sources,

**00:41:55** well, then what are you doing to yourself?

**00:41:58** Well, I think part of it,

**00:42:00** there's a way in which it's not always obvious

**00:42:02** if something is going to start relating to history.

**00:42:04** Like you just sort of think, oh, a person wrote in a book

**00:42:07** about this thing that happened.

**00:42:08** And it's like, oh, cool.

**00:42:09** Oh, let me just double check.

**00:42:10** Right, and then it's all over.

**00:42:11** Let me just double check.

**00:42:12** And it's like, oh, no, wait, history isn't real.

**00:42:16** This is all just full of lies.

**00:42:18** So I do think that that is a thing that I have

**00:42:21** newly established as a, please remind future me of this,

**00:42:26** because I know that I will forget.

**00:42:28** And also there may be ways in which to other people

**00:42:31** it is much more clear, you know, this might end up

**00:42:35** being history-related in some way.

**00:42:37** Maybe don't, maybe don't pick this one.

**00:42:40** I don't think that this system's gonna work for you

**00:42:42** as well as you think it will.

**00:42:44** Because if you haven't realized it,

**00:42:46** someone will say it to you.

**00:42:47** You just say, now it will be fine.

**00:42:51** Unless someone can actually stop you,

**00:42:54** I don't think that the system's gonna work for you.

**00:42:56** So this system's not gonna work for you.

**00:42:58** You'll be like, oh, I'm gonna make this video

**00:43:00** about this thing to be super easy.

**00:43:01** This one's simple.

**00:43:02** All I need to do is just find this.

**00:43:04** And then someone's gonna say to you, hey, no,

**00:43:05** this is a bad idea because you're gonna get stuck

**00:43:08** in this forever.

**00:43:09** And then you just say, no, no, no, this is an easy one.

**00:43:13** There's no checks of balances in this system.

**00:43:16** Yeah, I mean, Mike, here's a literal thing that happened.

**00:43:18** How difficult can it be to find the skull of a person

**00:43:21** from the year 1300, right?

**00:43:23** How hard can that be?

**00:43:25** Incredibly hard.

**00:43:28** How is this a question that you can dispose?

**00:43:32** So anyway, that's the kind of thing that pops up.

**00:43:36** So here's the thing.

**00:43:37** I do know what you're saying.

**00:43:39** I get it.

**00:43:40** But I also think this sort of thing exists everywhere.

**00:43:47** I'm a bit of a glutton for punishment

**00:43:49** with the history stuff and it makes me so mad.

**00:43:51** Like I can't even begin to tell you how angry it makes me

**00:43:54** when people write history books.

**00:43:55** And it's like, none of these sources check out.

**00:43:58** Like, why are you writing a history book?

**00:44:02** But all topics have this exact same thing.

**00:44:06** Even I think something like my beloved personal opposite

**00:44:10** of history, you take something like physics

**00:44:12** and even there, very quickly, you can start running

**00:44:15** into this exact same problem of,

**00:44:18** well, what do you mean by that word?

**00:44:20** Or just like the metric paper video.

**00:44:23** How do you wanna phrase the state of knowledge around here?

**00:44:27** It's a little bit better on the what is true dimension,

**00:44:32** but it still butts up against the same kind of problem.

**00:44:35** And like, what is the way that you talk about it?

**00:44:38** How confident is your ability to talk about it in this way?

**00:44:41** So I just think there's almost nothing

**00:44:43** that doesn't come against this in some way.

**00:44:46** And yeah, it's just been part of this like season

**00:44:49** of uncertainty that the Sharks project was filled

**00:44:52** with a lot of uncertainty for different sorts of reasons.

**00:44:55** And the current project has just been real frustrating

**00:44:59** where it seems like, what an easy topic.

**00:45:01** And it's like, oh God, none of this checks out.

**00:45:03** Even the very thing that I thought was like,

**00:45:05** oh, here's a definitive statement that someone

**00:45:07** in the modern day said about a thing.

**00:45:09** And it's like, oh, let me look up what she actually said.

**00:45:11** Oh, she didn't say the thing all the articles say

**00:45:13** that she said, which started this whole thing

**00:45:14** like God fucking dammit, so infuriating.

**00:45:18** Also just as a sidebar here,

**00:45:21** which we don't need to get derailed by,

**00:45:22** but when I'm in the middle of all this stuff,

**00:45:25** I can never help but think,

**00:45:27** I can't believe that people just want companies

**00:45:30** like YouTube and Facebook to be able to decide

**00:45:33** what is true and remove untrue things from their platforms.

**00:45:36** It's like, do people have any idea how difficult this is

**00:45:39** as a problem to solve?

**00:45:40** They're like, oh, I just like,

**00:45:42** they should just remove the things that aren't true.

**00:45:44** And when I talk to people who think that,

**00:45:45** it always ends up that what they actually mean is,

**00:45:48** well, I know everything that's true.

**00:45:50** So Facebook should just remove the things

**00:45:52** that I don't agree with.

**00:45:53** And it's like, oh God, dammit.

**00:45:54** Like the seed of the issue I was having a while ago

**00:45:57** with news.

**00:45:58** Yeah.

**00:45:59** Because a lot of the time,

**00:46:01** truth is defined by what people's belief system is.

**00:46:06** And that's super tricky.

**00:46:07** It's like, when I say everything that's true,

**00:46:10** it's everything I believe and agree with.

**00:46:13** Right.

**00:46:13** If two sides of a thing, both believe something's true,

**00:46:17** it can be really tricky to point at truth.

**00:46:19** You have to point at logic and I don't know, it's messy.

**00:46:22** Yeah.

**00:46:23** And I think it goes deeper than perhaps

**00:46:26** you should think about, you know, on that question.

**00:46:30** I just find it outrageous when people are like,

**00:46:32** oh, I just want YouTube to remove misinformation.

**00:46:34** It's like, oh, cool.

**00:46:37** I didn't know YouTube had the canonical truth

**00:46:40** about everything in the universe.

**00:46:42** Boy, we should ask YouTube the answer

**00:46:44** to all of the questions that we don't know about.

**00:46:46** Like, boy, they should have just told us everything

**00:46:50** about the pandemic or whatever.

**00:46:51** Like everything about the current political state

**00:46:54** in every country in the world.

**00:46:55** Like YouTube knows that.

**00:46:56** Wow.

**00:46:58** That's incredibly impressive.

**00:47:00** What a fount of knowledge they are.

**00:47:01** Great.

**00:47:02** Facebook could just take all the things

**00:47:03** that aren't true off their platform.

**00:47:05** What an incredible gift to humanity Facebook can perform.

**00:47:09** Or wait a minute,

**00:47:10** is this like an incredibly difficult problem

**00:47:13** that really comes down to individual people

**00:47:19** making calls that they like, right?

**00:47:23** Or that are what most people want them to make.

**00:47:28** Like that's a very different kind of thing.

**00:47:30** And so I'm always just,

**00:47:31** I'm just shocked at how quick people are to join the like,

**00:47:36** oh, just remove the untrue things.

**00:47:38** And this is super different, like this conversation.

**00:47:41** Cause I think people hear these things in certain ways.

**00:47:43** Like we know what we believe to be true.

**00:47:46** That's not the question.

**00:47:48** It's like, but then is what is the objective truth?

**00:47:50** And what about when things change?

**00:47:52** And what about when we don't know all of the things

**00:47:54** that we think we know?

**00:47:55** And like this pandemic is like the perfect example of this.

**00:47:58** Where like at the beginning,

**00:47:59** people were told not to wear masks, right?

**00:48:02** And then we were told it was transferred by surfaces.

**00:48:06** And then it turns out, although that was wrong as well.

**00:48:08** Human understanding only goes so far

**00:48:10** and we pick up things and we learn and adapt over time.

**00:48:13** So trying to ascribe truth to everything all the time

**00:48:16** can actually be an incredibly hard thing to do

**00:48:19** when we're still learning.

**00:48:21** Yeah. Oh yeah.

**00:48:22** This is also season of uncertainty.

**00:48:24** Like many things are really uncertain,

**00:48:26** but it's alarming how fast people are willing

**00:48:30** to jump on the like, oh, this is, we know this now, right?

**00:48:33** So you can't, you can't say anything that's not this thing.

**00:48:36** Oh, okay.

**00:48:37** Boy, I hope we got it right the first time.

**00:48:41** It's absolutely shocking.

**00:48:42** So that's just one of these things that floats

**00:48:44** through my mind as I'm just, just trying to work

**00:48:47** on some like what I thought would be innocent

**00:48:49** fun little video and just get infuriated

**00:48:52** with sloppily written books or articles on a thing.

**00:48:55** And, you know, that all just repeat each other in a circle.

**00:48:59** And no one went to go look at the book

**00:49:01** that they all think they're referencing.

**00:49:02** And I don't even know how this happens.

**00:49:04** It's so infuriating.

**00:49:05** But yeah, I just feel particularly frustrated

**00:49:07** because especially after sharks, which was just very hard

**00:49:12** which was supposed to be an easy video after metric paper

**00:49:15** which was like two years in the making or 10 years

**00:49:18** if you want to count like developing it

**00:49:20** from one of the lessons that I taught.

**00:49:22** It's like, oh, I'll have something easy.

**00:49:23** And then it was sharks.

**00:49:24** It's like, oh, that was terrible.

**00:49:25** That was terrible experience.

**00:49:27** And they're like, okay, I know this one will be easy.

**00:49:30** And it's like, no, you lose again.

**00:49:32** You lose so hard.

**00:49:34** And also here's your monthly dose of falling down

**00:49:39** the into the abyss of what is true dimension.

**00:49:42** Like, oh, great.

**00:49:43** Here we are again in this situation.

**00:49:46** So yeah, it's not been an amazing two months work wise.

**00:49:51** And it's been on my mind now that maybe all of this

**00:49:55** is coming to an end, but maybe not.

**00:49:57** I'm just trying to think about stuff like,

**00:50:00** you know, Mike has his cool office space.

**00:50:02** One of the things I was doing at the start of all of this

**00:50:05** was investigating office spaces.

**00:50:06** And it's like, is that a project that I start again?

**00:50:09** So this home office has been fantastic to me.

**00:50:12** I think I've literally done some of the best work thus far

**00:50:16** in my career in this home office.

**00:50:18** It's been amazing.

**00:50:19** But do I want to be in this home office indefinitely forever?

**00:50:26** No, I definitely don't.

**00:50:28** But you know, I just, I find it impossible to plan

**00:50:31** or to think about like,

**00:50:34** what would it mean to try to find another office space?

**00:50:36** And I don't know, I'm just kind of bummed about that

**00:50:39** because I'm just not in a,

**00:50:41** I feel like I'm in a no win situation

**00:50:44** for trying to find an office space.

**00:50:46** So that's just kind of frustrating.

**00:50:47** It's like, oh, I don't want to only have my home office

**00:50:49** as the working space,

**00:50:50** but there's just no good solution

**00:50:53** for finding something outside of my home space.

**00:50:57** Even if I was comfortable like going out

**00:50:59** and checking out office spaces right now,

**00:51:00** which I'm still not quite comfortable doing.

**00:51:02** So I don't know.

**00:51:04** That's just like a whole other thing.

**00:51:05** I mean, it probably is a good time to look.

**00:51:11** Yeah, I know what you're saying,

**00:51:13** but the problem that I'm in here

**00:51:15** is that I just don't think I can reasonably work

**00:51:20** in the kinds of offices I've worked in the past

**00:51:23** in the future.

**00:51:24** I think my needs for private and separate space

**00:51:28** are just too high at this point.

**00:51:30** And where I am, there's just, you know,

**00:51:34** there's just no office space.

**00:51:35** That's like that.

**00:51:36** Yeah, you're not gonna get something like that

**00:51:38** within any kind of reasonable budget range.

**00:51:40** Yes, that's the key thing.

**00:51:43** It may exist for many orders of magnitude more

**00:51:47** than I am able to spend on office space

**00:51:49** and still be able to turn a profit on the business.

**00:51:52** So that's one of the other things that's just been

**00:51:54** in the back of my mind and sort of frustrating.

**00:51:56** It's like, well, I know there's no good solution to this,

**00:52:00** but it still is like this little thorn

**00:52:02** that I keep thinking about of,

**00:52:03** I do wanna work outside of the home,

**00:52:04** but what does that mean?

**00:52:07** What could you reasonably rent to do something like that?

**00:52:11** Oh, nothing.

**00:52:13** Is there something that you could buy like Mike

**00:52:15** and maybe buy an office space at some point in the future?

**00:52:17** It's like, no.

**00:52:20** What's gonna be worse for you than it is for me?

**00:52:22** Oh, I know, yeah.

**00:52:23** It's hilariously impossible.

**00:52:26** Again, just where I am centrally located,

**00:52:28** it tends to be like, if you wanna purchase,

**00:52:30** you're purchasing the floor of a skyscraper or nothing.

**00:52:34** Like that's what it is.

**00:52:37** So yeah, I find that just like a really frustrating

**00:52:40** extra level of uncertainty

**00:52:41** that I just really have no idea what to do about, so.

**00:52:44** It's time to consider the outer rim.

**00:52:51** I know.

**00:52:52** So it's the only thing you can do.

**00:52:54** I'm in the outer rim and I'm struggling.

**00:52:56** If I look around, there's barely anything for me.

**00:52:59** Yeah.

**00:53:00** You're never gonna find, I'll tell you right now,

**00:53:03** you will never get a private office in central London

**00:53:06** within a budget range that you're willing to accept.

**00:53:08** I will tell you this categorically right now.

**00:53:11** It's never going to happen for you.

**00:53:13** But also Mike, I don't wanna move out of central London.

**00:53:18** You don't have to move.

**00:53:20** Like commuting is a thing people do.

**00:53:22** That is an option for you.

**00:53:24** Right, but I know how far you are out

**00:53:26** and that's not a daily commute that I want to do.

**00:53:30** I'm not far, but also like you can get to one

**00:53:34** of the major train lines that take you into different

**00:53:38** parts of London.

**00:53:39** As long as you get the train at the right time,

**00:53:41** you can be there every 15 minutes or whatever.

**00:53:44** Maybe, maybe that maybe like.

**00:53:47** How fast you can get to the airport.

**00:53:48** Yeah, I'll get an office at the airport.

**00:53:52** There you go, easy.

**00:53:53** I'm sure that's the justice chart.

**00:53:56** Cortex listeners, if in the future you suspiciously

**00:53:58** hear a plane every 15 minutes, you know what I've done.

**00:54:01** Go get his airport office.

**00:54:06** Yeah, I mean maybe.

**00:54:09** I think you need to start taking a look at train lines

**00:54:13** and then identify some areas around train stations

**00:54:16** that are outside of central London

**00:54:19** and then start trying to look in those areas.

**00:54:22** Right, but isn't that also just silly and absurd?

**00:54:25** Like isn't there something that's just ridiculous

**00:54:27** about that?

**00:54:28** I think that feels ridiculous.

**00:54:30** I don't know.

**00:54:31** What's ridiculous about it?

**00:54:32** It feels ridiculous because in some ways it's like,

**00:54:35** dude, just move.

**00:54:36** That's awful.

**00:54:37** Like doing this weird reverse commute is just ridiculous.

**00:54:42** It seems like a silly thing to do.

**00:54:44** Like you should just move closer to where you are.

**00:54:46** I mean, yeah, but it depends on what you're looking for.

**00:54:50** I think that this would probably be the start

**00:54:53** of you considering moving.

**00:54:56** Which is like a similar thing to what we're going through

**00:54:58** because we're also thinking about moving.

**00:55:02** We always had planned to be in our apartment for five years

**00:55:05** and then we wanted to get a house.

**00:55:06** And so to get that, we're gonna move further away from,

**00:55:10** like still in South London,

**00:55:11** but further away from central is the plan

**00:55:13** because then the further you are away,

**00:55:17** the more your money can get you, right?

**00:55:19** Yeah.

**00:55:20** And so that's the thing that we're starting to consider.

**00:55:23** The last year and a half has kind of proven to us

**00:55:25** that that would be perfectly fine

**00:55:27** because we don't actually need to go into London

**00:55:29** for anything.

**00:55:30** We can just go whenever we want.

**00:55:32** But we're looking to kind of stay on a main train line

**00:55:35** so it's easy enough for us to do it.

**00:55:37** But like, I think it would make sense for you

**00:55:40** to try and get an office in a different part of London

**00:55:43** to then realize why you might wanna be out of central London

**00:55:47** or what the benefits to you would be

**00:55:49** for being out of central London.

**00:55:51** Yeah, I know you're right.

**00:55:53** I know you're right.

**00:55:54** But there's some part of my brain which goes,

**00:55:56** oh, if you move out of zone one, because it's cheaper,

**00:56:01** why don't you just move to Wyoming?

**00:56:03** Like, there's some part of my brain that just says that.

**00:56:06** I've been having this thought recently too.

**00:56:08** Okay, tell me your thoughts on this.

**00:56:09** So I've been thinking about the things

**00:56:12** that I think are, like I find important.

**00:56:14** What I consider is like the things that I hold

**00:56:18** to make me feel comfortable and what I would like.

**00:56:21** And what I would like is more space.

**00:56:24** And I really enjoy peace and quiet in my home life.

**00:56:30** I don't like to be bugged by other people.

**00:56:33** I don't like outside sound.

**00:56:35** I like kind of when I'm at home

**00:56:37** to just be secluded in a way.

**00:56:42** So when we're looking to buy,

**00:56:44** I kind of wanna try and find a home

**00:56:46** that's not like a terraced house.

**00:56:48** We have a lot of terraced houses here in London.

**00:56:51** Because you've got people on both sides of you.

**00:56:53** We've been very lucky in our apartment building.

**00:56:55** We've actually, we haven't had any problem neighbors

**00:56:58** or anything like that.

**00:56:59** But this is a thing I've experienced in the past.

**00:57:02** And so I was kind of thinking about this recently

**00:57:05** of like, what if we just moved

**00:57:09** like the middle of nowhere kind of places?

**00:57:13** Again, it's just something I've had in my mind.

**00:57:14** I don't think I wanna do it yet.

**00:57:16** I think it could be maybe something

**00:57:19** that I would try and like bring to the family council

**00:57:24** at some point in the future, like much later in life

**00:57:27** if it's something that I still want,

**00:57:29** like to be in a more secluded part of the world.

**00:57:33** I feel like this is maybe just a thing

**00:57:35** that a lot of people get into as they get older.

**00:57:37** But yes, to echo that point, yeah,

**00:57:39** why not just move to, I don't know why we picked Wyoming,

**00:57:42** but why not just move to Wyoming?

**00:57:44** Because it's beautiful

**00:57:45** and you can go there and be a cowboy.

**00:57:46** Okay, cool.

**00:57:47** I mean, I didn't really know anything about Wyoming, honestly.

**00:57:49** Mike, their slogan is forever West.

**00:57:52** Come on, that's amazing.

**00:57:55** None of that really means anything to me.

**00:57:58** Again, just you saying forever West, it is zero to me.

**00:58:02** I have no attachment to this.

**00:58:04** You don't culturally understand.

**00:58:05** No, I don't really get it.

**00:58:07** But so you could do that,

**00:58:09** but that's maybe a bit too extreme.

**00:58:11** When there is an opportunity for that kind of middle,

**00:58:15** there is a middle opportunity,

**00:58:17** which is like you can still be in and around the thing.

**00:58:22** Why do you even want to be in central London anymore?

**00:58:25** What is the thing that makes you want to be there?

**00:58:28** It's an interesting question

**00:58:29** and I can't answer it any better than simply to say,

**00:58:34** I really like it.

**00:58:35** I really like living in central London.

**00:58:37** I've talked about moving

**00:58:39** and the ultimate thing is just I like it

**00:58:42** and I'm not ready to go.

**00:58:44** I would be sad if I left.

**00:58:46** And that's not an amazing reason.

**00:58:49** There's nothing specific in there.

**00:58:50** Like if you're making a pro and con list.

**00:58:52** It's emotional, you can't explain that.

**00:58:53** And that's important.

**00:58:55** But this is why I maybe recommend

**00:58:58** thinking about that reverse commute

**00:59:00** and seeing how that feels.

**00:59:03** Cause there are lots of pockets of London

**00:59:04** that have some of the benefits that you'd be looking for.

**00:59:07** Like nice places to walk around in,

**00:59:09** you know, like there's interest in things,

**00:59:12** but they're just not skyscrapers.

**00:59:14** I think maybe part of, if I try to coalesce it,

**00:59:18** I feel like one of the nice things about London

**00:59:21** is that the interesting density is very high,

**00:59:26** just geographically, you know,

**00:59:28** like that's always the advantage that a big city has

**00:59:31** is like interesting density is high,

**00:59:33** but that's probably about as well as I could put it.

**00:59:37** But I think that's, this is partly why my inclination is,

**00:59:41** has always been like, I don't like middle way solutions.

**00:59:45** I like to min max stuff.

**00:59:47** So it's like, oh, the city is great

**00:59:49** because interesting density is very high.

**00:59:52** I just like it.

**00:59:53** A city is a very particular kind of way of living.

**00:59:56** You have to minimize a lot in order to do it,

**01:00:00** including your ability to save.

**01:00:01** Like it's very expensive.

**01:00:03** Like there's a whole bunch of really good reasons

**01:00:05** not to live in a city,

**01:00:06** but you're maximizing the benefits

**01:00:08** that you get out of the city.

**01:00:10** But it's why when I think about,

**01:00:12** oh, moving out a little, my brain goes,

**01:00:15** yeah, no, no, min max the other way, right?

**01:00:18** Go to the place where you can get the maximum space, right?

**01:00:22** Where you could have a house that is exactly the way

**01:00:26** that you want it because you can just get a whole bunch

**01:00:28** of space because land is really cheap.

**01:00:30** And like min max in the opposite direction,

**01:00:33** if you're going to make a change,

**01:00:35** I just temperamentally don't love the middle solution.

**01:00:40** So I think that's part of the reason why like,

**01:00:42** I'm also resistant to leaving because I'm not ready

**01:00:46** to min max in the other way right now.

**01:00:50** And so I think that's, if I'm trying to articulate it,

**01:00:53** it's partly why like, oh, the office space

**01:00:56** that's the reverse commute feels a little bit

**01:00:59** like the middle path, but maybe you're right.

**01:01:01** Maybe I should just give it a try and see how it is.

**01:01:04** Well, you can't min max the office.

**01:01:06** What do you mean?

**01:01:07** You can't do the min max of an office space.

**01:01:10** Yeah, yeah.

**01:01:11** I mean, I can get the minimum amount of space

**01:01:13** with the maximum amount of money is the kind of-

**01:01:15** I actually don't even think that this option

**01:01:17** is available to you.

**01:01:19** Even the minimum amount of office space

**01:01:21** that would be acceptable to you

**01:01:23** when a walking distance of where you live

**01:01:25** would be outside of the budget that you could afford,

**01:01:29** not even would want to,

**01:01:30** just cause of like, it will be even rarer to find.

**01:01:35** So someone with more money's already got it.

**01:01:38** Yes, exactly.

**01:01:39** And so this is one, like the min max of the office

**01:01:43** is probably what I'm talking about.

**01:01:47** Because this is still a thing,

**01:01:48** like having any kind of like private space

**01:01:52** is really expensive anyway,

**01:01:54** no matter where you are in London.

**01:01:56** Cause they have things trying to find it.

**01:01:57** It's impossible to find it

**01:01:59** unless you want to open a tiny little store.

**01:02:02** Right, unless you want to commit fraud.

**01:02:04** I feel like we need to look into this.

**01:02:07** Is this feasible?

**01:02:10** I feel like I need to get an answer to that.

**01:02:14** Because like we technically do own a retail brand now

**01:02:17** in a way.

**01:02:18** So like we have stock.

**01:02:20** This could be the fun start of a long battle

**01:02:23** with a local council.

**01:02:24** That's the way this could go.

**01:02:27** That's exactly what we've been looking for.

**01:02:29** Right.

**01:02:30** How much of a store is a store, right?

**01:02:33** We can have this be a philosophical question.

**01:02:36** We could have two outlets even, you know?

**01:02:38** Yeah.

**01:02:39** I have an outlet and you have an outlet.

**01:02:41** It's perfect.

**01:02:42** Yeah, that could work.

**01:02:43** I will tell you there is one real definitive advantage

**01:02:46** that I can mention with being in central London,

**01:02:49** which is that it makes traveling everywhere super easy.

**01:02:55** Like I do really like that.

**01:02:57** I feel like London is an amazing jump off point

**01:02:59** for going to lots of different places

**01:03:02** because London has direct flights in the world

**01:03:04** to like everywhere.

**01:03:06** And also living on GMT makes traveling to lots of places

**01:03:10** very easy to do as well,

**01:03:12** as long as you're willing to hold the time zone.

**01:03:13** I don't know how far you think South London is.

**01:03:17** Add 30 minutes to the journey.

**01:03:21** That's all it is.

**01:03:24** If you're going to travel for nine hours,

**01:03:26** an extra half an hour is not that bad.

**01:03:28** No, that's the killer one, Mike.

**01:03:30** No, I don't know what you think like is happening here.

**01:03:33** Mike, once you're off the plane,

**01:03:37** it's like you want to be done, right?

**01:03:40** The plane travel is the only travel, then that's it.

**01:03:43** Like traveling across the city

**01:03:47** and then down South afterward, forget it.

**01:03:49** I don't want to do that.

**01:03:54** You act like I don't know where you are.

**01:03:55** I know exactly where you are.

**01:03:57** I've been out there.

**01:03:59** Pack supplies.

**01:04:00** Oh my God.

**01:04:04** No, all joking aside, I mean this in the sense of

**01:04:08** why do I want to stay in London just full stop, right?

**01:04:12** I'm not like seriously saying no South London thing.

**01:04:15** This is the why not travel to some place with local.

**01:04:18** But I just ascribe to all of this.

**01:04:21** I'm totally in on this.

**01:04:22** Even when I talk about moving out to more space,

**01:04:25** London's really big.

**01:04:27** It's bigger than what people think.

**01:04:30** And you can still quote be in London

**01:04:33** and live in a very different set of circumstances.

**01:04:36** Yeah, it is something that for people who visit the city,

**01:04:39** you just don't realize that the geographical area of this,

**01:04:42** like the geographical area that the tube covers is huge.

**01:04:46** Like the actual area is much bigger than New York City.

**01:04:50** It's the same number of people,

**01:04:52** but they're just spread out over a much larger area.

**01:04:55** And yeah, there's a lot of different kinds

**01:04:57** of living situations within the city.

**01:04:58** I just meant it in terms of, oh, if I move to Wyoming,

**01:05:02** it'll be a lot more difficult to travel to places.

**01:05:04** That would be a real inconvenience.

**01:05:06** Yeah, because then you connect in flights.

**01:05:07** If you've got to get connected in flights,

**01:05:09** then we're into a different.

**01:05:10** Yeah.

**01:05:11** It's like I felt like what would it be like

**01:05:12** to maybe move to a different part of the United Kingdom?

**01:05:16** But that's further than I'm thinking

**01:05:18** even would consider right now.

**01:05:19** Much love to the rest of the UK,

**01:05:21** but then we're in that problem of like,

**01:05:23** do I need to connect to Heathrow to go to somewhere?

**01:05:27** It's like, I don't want to do that.

**01:05:28** And the answer is yes.

**01:05:29** The answer is 100% of the time, yes.

**01:05:31** You always need to connect.

**01:05:32** I don't like connecting flights, not because of the time,

**01:05:35** just because of the aggravation, the stress.

**01:05:38** You know?

**01:05:39** And the uncertainty.

**01:05:39** I hate that feeling.

**01:05:41** I mean, this all stems from the first time

**01:05:43** I went to America, I missed my connecting flight.

**01:05:46** You've been traumatized ever since.

**01:05:47** Right, so like I have this inbuilt trauma

**01:05:51** of being stuck in Philadelphia.

**01:05:54** And I had no idea what I was doing

**01:05:56** or where I was going in the hotel.

**01:05:58** It was like a whole mess, just like a big mess.

**01:06:01** I've experienced it and it's horrible.

**01:06:03** So I try to avoid it.

**01:06:05** And having to connect before I've even gone over

**01:06:08** the Atlantic feels like horrible to me.

**01:06:10** Yeah, that's not a great situation to do that.

**01:06:16** Sorry, Scotland.

**01:06:17** You don't want to live up in the moors.

**01:06:19** But I think Scotland's beautiful.

**01:06:21** And I guess again, this other thing of like,

**01:06:24** even going to another big city, right?

**01:06:27** That's not London, but it's still just not,

**01:06:30** it's just not what I want.

**01:06:32** Yeah, this is the season of uncertainty.

**01:06:36** It's just very frustrating trying to make any kind of plans

**01:06:38** and thinking about the future.

**01:06:40** And I feel like I'll be very happy

**01:06:43** to fast forward two months.

**01:06:47** I feel like maybe I will live to regret these words,

**01:06:50** but I feel reasonably confident that in two months time,

**01:06:54** the uncertainty level will dramatically drop.

**01:06:57** We'll know more about the state of the world.

**01:07:00** Without a doubt, the current video project

**01:07:02** will be published and I will 100% have correctly chosen.

**01:07:08** Finally, a nice easy video to do after the current project.

**01:07:13** There's no way that I'm gonna make a mistake

**01:07:15** in that selection.

**01:07:16** Hopefully some travel plans will actually be set

**01:07:19** in the calendar so I can know what my life looks like.

**01:07:23** So yeah, confident that two months from now,

**01:07:27** the season of uncertainty will 100,

**01:07:32** 85%, maybe 60% be over.

**01:07:36** I just made a note for myself,

**01:07:38** for episode 120, check Grey's statements

**01:07:41** at the end of the uncertainty discussion.

**01:07:46** I think that's a really good thing to do.

**01:07:47** Like I'm a big fan,

**01:07:48** I'm sure people who listen can hear it,

**01:07:51** I'm a big fan of trying to express things

**01:07:54** in bets and percentages.

**01:07:58** And I also think it is, it's not always easy to do,

**01:08:00** but I do try sometimes to write down the guesses

**01:08:05** at certain points in time.

**01:08:06** And I think it's really helpful to sharpen your thinking.

**01:08:10** And it's something that I've done really starting this year

**01:08:14** is to try and be like, make a note of what probability

**01:08:18** you give to a future outcome at a certain period in time.

**01:08:22** And I think it's an interesting and new sort of way

**01:08:25** that it feels like to me to connect your future

**01:08:29** and past selves again,

**01:08:31** a bit like having a notebook at all.

**01:08:33** So I like that you're making a note there

**01:08:35** to check in with me on is the season of uncertainty over

**01:08:39** in two months.

**01:08:41** Very confident it will be.

**01:08:45** I can't wait to find out

**01:08:46** what my future video product will be then.

**01:08:48** Nice and easy.

**01:08:49** Nice and easy.

**01:08:51** No history.

**01:08:52** No history.

**01:10:32** Our thanks to DoorDash for the support of this show

**01:10:34** and Relay FM.

**01:10:36** So I have a hashtag ask Cortex question

**01:10:38** that I actually think dovetails quite nicely

**01:10:41** with our uncertainty discussion.

**01:10:44** It comes from M55 who says,

**01:10:46** has the pandemic made you feel less motivated in your work?

**01:10:50** Hmm, how would you answer that?

**01:10:52** So I recently had a feeling and stated it out loud

**01:10:59** and felt it a little bit since then.

**01:11:01** And I don't know if it's related to this,

**01:11:03** but it is something that I've noticed

**01:11:06** where I think that right now

**01:11:09** I am doing the best work of my life.

**01:11:11** Really?

**01:11:12** I feel like right now in a lot of the projects

**01:11:15** that I'm doing, I think I'm putting in as much work

**01:11:19** as I've ever put in them, if not more.

**01:11:21** I think the output's good.

**01:11:24** And I feel like I'm split across a few different areas

**01:11:28** that are all going well

**01:11:30** and all making me feel good about them.

**01:11:33** I don't think that this is necessarily

**01:11:37** because of the pandemic,

**01:11:38** but I have been because of it nudged in certain directions.

**01:11:42** And this is kind of how I've come out.

**01:11:45** I think I'm doing right now

**01:11:48** some of the best stuff that I've done.

**01:11:50** And I don't think that that's something

**01:11:52** that I necessarily feel like

**01:11:53** is just because of time and experience.

**01:11:55** Cause I haven't always felt like,

**01:11:57** I can look back at different times

**01:11:59** in my professional career

**01:12:01** and feel like some things were better

**01:12:02** than others at different times.

**01:12:04** But right now I feel like by and large,

**01:12:07** the stuff that I'm doing is as good as it's ever been.

**01:12:10** When you say nudged in certain directions,

**01:12:12** what do you mean by that?

**01:12:13** I think I've accelerated some projects out of fear.

**01:12:19** And I've also had a unbroken amount of time

**01:12:23** to put things in action.

**01:12:26** I was meant to mention this

**01:12:28** when we were talking about working life patterns and stuff,

**01:12:30** which is like, I have not taken a vacation

**01:12:34** since January, 2020.

**01:12:35** It was the last time I took a vacation.

**01:12:37** So that has its own problems,

**01:12:40** which I am looking to address.

**01:12:43** But other than vacation,

**01:12:45** like it's like, it sounds a bit harsh.

**01:12:46** I was thinking the work travel, right?

**01:12:48** Which is probably a better point to mention here.

**01:12:50** Yeah.

**01:12:51** That I haven't had these big chunks of the year

**01:12:53** that have been broken up because of me having less focus

**01:12:57** on not being able to put the same level of focus on something

**01:12:59** cause I'm somewhere else doing a different thing.

**01:13:02** And I think that that has helped,

**01:13:05** but I don't think it's because of that, but it's helped.

**01:13:07** And it's like stuff like all of the membership content,

**01:13:11** it's just additional things that I'm working hard

**01:13:13** to try and make as good as it can be.

**01:13:16** Yeah.

**01:13:17** I feel pretty good about the stuff that I'm doing

**01:13:20** and the areas that I'm working in.

**01:13:22** And so I would say probably like the pandemic has helped

**01:13:27** in my motivation.

**01:13:29** And I think some of that motivation is to say came from

**01:13:31** like fear and uncertainty, but right now I feel pretty

**01:13:34** content with the stuff that I'm up to.

**01:13:36** It's interesting that you, yeah, I just think

**01:13:38** it's interesting you don't think that it's because

**01:13:40** of the pandemic, but like the pandemic is a facilitating

**01:13:44** event, I guess.

**01:13:46** Yeah.

**01:13:47** And you sure we're busting your butt over the membership

**01:13:49** stuff at the beginning of all of this.

**01:13:51** Yeah.

**01:13:52** Cause this is, I don't think any of the things that I'm doing

**01:13:54** are things I wouldn't have done, but they probably wouldn't

**01:13:57** have all started and happened at the same time.

**01:14:00** Like it's just, it was like an acceleration effect.

**01:14:04** And so you just feel like also just the, like the podcast

**01:14:07** that you're making are better.

**01:14:08** Like when you just say it's like the best work of your life

**01:14:11** is it content wise and business wise?

**01:14:13** Is that what you mean?

**01:14:14** Yeah, I think that, I mean, this is always, it's difficult

**01:14:17** to say, right?

**01:14:18** Cause people are going to have different opinions.

**01:14:20** Like I have no doubt that there are people like, no, Mike's

**01:14:22** shows used to be better.

**01:14:23** Like, cause that's just how it is, right?

**01:14:25** Like I want the old Mike back, whatever that might have been,

**01:14:28** you know?

**01:14:29** Right. Whatever that might've been in that person's memory

**01:14:31** as well.

**01:14:31** Exactly.

**01:14:32** Is the point.

**01:14:33** There's no doubt about that.

**01:14:34** And that doesn't bother me honestly, but for me personally,

**01:14:37** my own sense of satisfaction, I feel very happy with what

**01:14:42** I'm putting out right now across all the different shows

**01:14:45** that I work on.

**01:14:46** Like I feel very good about the work and I don't always

**01:14:51** feel good about the work, right?

**01:14:53** But I do, I feel good about the work.

**01:14:55** And then I feel like my other ventures are going well,

**01:14:59** right?

**01:15:00** I feel like Cortex brand is going really well.

**01:15:02** Like we're in a better position than I think we thought

**01:15:05** we would have been at this point.

**01:15:06** Plus I'm feeling like I'm learning so much and having

**01:15:12** that feeling of feeling a bit more confident and in control

**01:15:17** of stuff than I did before.

**01:15:19** And then even kind of like my hobby type things, right?

**01:15:23** So like the Twitch streaming, I'm like really enjoying it.

**01:15:26** And it's going great for me.

**01:15:29** I think they're all coming together pretty well.

**01:15:31** That's really good to hear.

**01:15:32** Maybe this is something you shouldn't say out loud,

**01:15:34** you know?

**01:15:35** I'll find out I suppose, but it is how I feel about my work

**01:15:38** right now.

**01:15:39** Yeah, yeah.

**01:15:40** It can be difficult to talk about this stuff.

**01:15:43** Like especially when you just you know

**01:15:46** that there is the inevitable judgment by the audience

**01:15:50** about like their own feelings when you say, oh, I'm making

**01:15:53** the best stuff that I've ever made.

**01:15:56** Like you will hear from everyone who disagrees.

**01:15:59** Yeah, but my feeling, I read that comment.

**01:16:01** I read these comments all the time anyway.

**01:16:03** So like, but it hasn't changed my opinion.

**01:16:06** That's good.

**01:16:06** Like I'm glad to hear that as well,

**01:16:08** because that's the kind of thing that you need as the creator

**01:16:10** is to be able to separate yourself from that a little bit.

**01:16:13** Yeah, it's interesting.

**01:16:15** I think about that because like as much as I

**01:16:17** have complained about it, I think

**01:16:19** that sharks video of mine is maybe one of my favorite videos

**01:16:22** that I've made in a long time.

**01:16:23** So good, man.

**01:16:24** It just came together exactly the way I was hoping.

**01:16:28** Like there's a couple of minor things that I would tweak,

**01:16:31** but most of the time when I make a video,

**01:16:33** I'm like, I never want to look at that again,

**01:16:35** but I actually have rewatched the shark video a few times.

**01:16:38** I'm like, no, that came out great.

**01:16:39** Like I'm pretty happy with that.

**01:16:41** And like that definitely wouldn't have happened

**01:16:44** without the pandemic for sure.

**01:16:47** I wouldn't say that the pandemic has made me feel

**01:16:49** less motivated in my work.

**01:16:51** I feel, I think I feel some combination of my own,

**01:17:01** more motivated.

**01:17:02** I think in the past year, I've been like,

**01:17:05** just been thinking about potential future projects

**01:17:10** a lot more intensely than I have in the past.

**01:17:13** So I don't know, I feel like there's more of a motivation

**01:17:17** to get things done combined with a little bit

**01:17:23** of a frustration as always of like,

**01:17:25** oh, I just work slow, but also a kind of acceptance of that.

**01:17:31** But I don't know, I feel like that's also just been my arc

**01:17:35** for like the past two years in general.

**01:17:38** So I don't know, I don't feel like the pandemic

**01:17:41** has really changed my feelings one way or the other

**01:17:48** with a few things that I wanted to work on,

**01:17:50** it disrupted plans, but I think I'm just on the same kind

**01:17:54** of arc that I've been on for the past couple of years.

**01:17:56** And the pandemic hasn't really affected things

**01:17:59** one way or the other.

**01:18:00** Louis had a question about the sharks video actually.

**01:18:04** Recently Gray mentioned how he avoids unnecessarily

**01:18:07** referencing dates in his videos, but in sharks,

**01:18:09** he says you must go see them this month.

**01:18:11** Was this intentional or was it unnoticed?

**01:18:16** There's nothing in the videos that's unnoticed

**01:18:18** like that I'm saying out loud.

**01:18:19** Yeah, everything's intentional.

**01:18:22** Of course, except for the things that are unintentional.

**01:18:24** In the podcast there can be things.

**01:18:26** Yes.

**01:18:27** Because they're different, cause it's extemporaneous

**01:18:28** versus very well planned and edited and edited

**01:18:32** and then recorded and edited and edited.

**01:18:34** It's different.

**01:18:35** Right, yeah.

**01:18:36** Or again, if I had my way with the podcast,

**01:18:38** I would have just rerecorded that entire section

**01:18:40** of me talking about magic and go, no, that was awful.

**01:18:43** I'm gonna rerecord all my lines explaining it again.

**01:18:45** It doesn't work like that.

**01:18:46** And that's why podcasts can exist.

**01:18:48** Yeah, it was funny because when we were talking about that,

**01:18:50** I already knew that that line was going to be in the video.

**01:18:53** I was aware like, oh, I bet people are gonna pick up

**01:18:55** on this when it actually comes out.

**01:18:57** Cortexons who are paying attention.

**01:19:00** Like my whole thing about timeless content

**01:19:02** is about thinking about if you need to reference

**01:19:07** a specific time and my annoyance with content

**01:19:11** that needlessly places itself at an exact moment in time.

**01:19:16** And the sharks video was intrinsically about

**01:19:21** that exact moment.

**01:19:23** And there are dates all over that video.

**01:19:25** Like every time I'm showing the past competitions,

**01:19:27** you can see like, oh, this was the 2020 winner.

**01:19:29** This was the 2021 winner.

**01:19:32** And I could have gone and tried to scrub all of that stuff

**01:19:36** out, but it's like, it doesn't matter.

**01:19:38** And the fact of the sharks being there now,

**01:19:42** but if you want to see them, you have to go this month.

**01:19:46** I feel like that's part of the content of the video.

**01:19:49** And sure, I could have phrased it in a different way.

**01:19:52** Like if I wanted to, I could have said,

**01:19:54** oh, you need to go see the sharks super soon.

**01:19:59** But I just don't think that would have had

**01:20:01** the same impact on it.

**01:20:03** And I'm also okay with it because I was thinking,

**01:20:06** well, in the future, most of the, you know,

**01:20:09** for most of time, the sharks are not going to be

**01:20:13** at this location.

**01:20:14** Like I was pretty confident that they were actually

**01:20:16** going to get moved.

**01:20:18** So I'm actually very fine saying,

**01:20:21** you must go see them this month.

**01:20:23** Because in a weird way, it makes it true in the future

**01:20:27** that the viewer knows, oh, they're probably not there.

**01:20:31** But I also like that it just,

**01:20:34** it introduces a little bit of doubt.

**01:20:36** So I don't know if this will really happen,

**01:20:38** but I suspect that there's a way in which that

**01:20:42** going forward will get people to investigate

**01:20:47** on their own a little bit,

**01:20:49** hey, what happened to those sharks?

**01:20:50** In a way that if I said soon,

**01:20:53** I feel like it's not as obviously motivating

**01:20:56** when someone's watching it in the future.

**01:20:57** They go, oh, okay, they're not there.

**01:21:00** Where are they?

**01:21:01** Instead of just not thinking about,

**01:21:03** are they there now or not?

**01:21:05** So it was a very deliberate decision.

**01:21:07** If there was some universe in which the story of the sharks

**01:21:10** was not time dependent, I would have written it that way.

**01:21:13** But like, that was not the story of those sharks.

**01:21:16** And I also just wanted to let people know,

**01:21:19** like, you really need to go see them now.

**01:21:21** And lots of people did.

**01:21:23** And I was very happy to see like messages from people,

**01:21:27** from everyone who went out to investigate those sharks.

**01:21:29** My personal favorite is there was a guy

**01:21:31** who was getting married and went out to see the sharks

**01:21:35** before his ceremony.

**01:21:36** I was like, that's a mate.

**01:21:37** Like that stuff just warms my heart.

**01:21:39** That's a big pill damage.

**01:21:41** Yeah, some people who clocked that like,

**01:21:44** oh, these are other people who've watched the shark videos.

**01:21:47** So it was, I found that just delightful.

**01:21:49** I absolutely love that stuff.

**01:21:51** And I think it is much more motivating the way

**01:21:52** that it is phrased to get people to like,

**01:21:55** for real go right now.

**01:21:57** Are they gone?

**01:21:58** They are gone now.

**01:21:59** Like, huh, okay.

**01:22:01** Yeah, it's a very, oh God, it's exhausting to even say.

**01:22:06** For the thing that I'm currently working on,

**01:22:09** I was trying to find someone's grave.

**01:22:12** And so when I was doing that.

**01:22:14** Indiana Jones over here, you're looking for a skull,

**01:22:20** a grave, look at you.

**01:22:21** I happened on my way to trying to find this grave,

**01:22:25** cycle past the location of the sharks

**01:22:28** and happened to hit them as they were being removed,

**01:22:32** which was just very surreal.

**01:22:35** It was a surreal experience.

**01:22:36** So I know from firsthand accounts

**01:22:39** that the sharks were taken away

**01:22:42** because I saw them get taken away

**01:22:45** in the process of going somewhere else

**01:22:48** to try to find a thing.
