# Cortex - 123: 2022 Yearly Themes
**00:00:00** I'm recording in two places now.

**00:00:01** I have been recording this whole time.

**00:00:03** I'm just going to let it run.

**00:00:04** There you go.

**00:00:04** Let me close this map of Hawaii,

**00:00:07** pull up the show notes, pull up my notes,

**00:00:11** take my hands off the keyboard.

**00:00:13** Excellent.

**00:00:13** Don't mess up anything.

**00:00:14** Sit on your hands.

**00:00:16** Yeah, hands off the keyboard, back up slowly.

**00:00:20** Ready to record.

**00:00:21** Sir, do not approach the keyboard.

**00:00:25** Can you believe it's the last episode of the year?

**00:00:27** No.

**00:00:28** I just had that feeling.

**00:00:30** I looked at the date on the top of my computer here,

**00:00:33** and it said it was December.

**00:00:35** And I was like, wow.

**00:00:36** That just feels unexpected, even though I

**00:00:39** knew it was coming at the same time.

**00:00:41** Yeah, well, I mean, that's what happens when your year is only

**00:00:43** four months long.

**00:00:44** So let's get to the end of it quite quickly.

**00:00:47** I'm not entirely sure what that means.

**00:00:49** What does that mean?

**00:00:49** That is my mental estimation for how subjectively long

**00:00:53** has this year felt.

**00:00:54** Ah, yeah.

**00:00:54** I think this year has felt like it is four months long.

**00:00:57** I was really trying to pin it down.

**00:01:00** Three months, that's too dramatic.

**00:01:02** Five months is almost half a year,

**00:01:04** and it doesn't feel like that.

**00:01:05** So I'm going with four months as it feels subjectively

**00:01:09** like it's been about four months long this year.

**00:01:11** Well, Adina mentioned this while we've been traveling.

**00:01:15** It was like, really, our year started in August

**00:01:18** when we got our second shot.

**00:01:21** That's when our year actually began.

**00:01:22** It's when we started doing things

**00:01:24** that weren't that one same thing.

**00:01:26** And so it really has been like four or five

**00:01:29** months of an actual different year.

**00:01:33** And so it feels like it's gone by quickly.

**00:01:35** Because it feels to me, like in my mind, I think like, oh,

**00:01:40** I have been vaccinated for all of 2021.

**00:01:43** But I haven't been.

**00:01:44** It was August.

**00:01:46** So yeah, I think it has got that,

**00:01:48** weirdly, has actually got that feeling to it.

**00:01:50** Yeah, yeah.

**00:01:51** I'm just trying to do the math in my head,

**00:01:53** and I think I've been quad-vaxxed for just about

**00:01:55** that amount of time.

**00:01:56** So yeah, that's how long the year's been.

**00:01:58** I don't want to talk about this again.

**00:02:00** I don't want to talk about how many vaccinations you've had

**00:02:02** again.

**00:02:04** I think about it.

**00:02:05** Anyway, yearly themes time for 2022.

**00:02:09** Yearly themes time.

**00:02:10** All right, so what is a yearly theme?

**00:02:12** So this is the fifth time, I think, that we've done this?

**00:02:15** I don't know.

**00:02:16** Maybe.

**00:02:17** Which is kind of an incredible thing.

**00:02:18** I want to give a very quick overview.

**00:02:20** I will say at this point, the best place to get a primer

**00:02:23** on what is a theme is to watch Gray's YouTube video.

**00:02:26** And I'll make sure that that's in the show notes.

**00:02:28** Could you make that?

**00:02:29** Was that last year that you made that video?

**00:02:31** I don't know when it's time.

**00:02:33** Yeah, it could have been.

**00:02:34** I think that's two years ago.

**00:02:35** Was it more than four months ago?

**00:02:37** Then the answer could be yes.

**00:02:38** Is it three years ago?

**00:02:39** It might have been three years ago.

**00:02:40** I don't know.

**00:02:41** But basically, with a theme, with our themes,

**00:02:44** we look at what we want to achieve and focus on in a year.

**00:02:48** Themes can be shorter, but we tend

**00:02:49** to think of them in about a year's time on this show.

**00:02:52** We look at our working lives, our personal lives.

**00:02:54** We think about what we want to change,

**00:02:56** what we want to continue, and create a theme around that.

**00:02:59** And then the theme acts as a guide for us through that time.

**00:03:02** It can be a phrase, or it can be some key outcomes,

**00:03:05** thinking about where do we want to be in a year from now.

**00:03:08** Themes are not the same as resolutions,

**00:03:10** because they are not strict goals

**00:03:11** that you have some kind of success or failure in.

**00:03:15** So for example, one of my favorite

**00:03:17** is saying a year of health is much more kind to you

**00:03:21** than I want to lose 20 pounds.

**00:03:23** Because if you lost 19 pounds, you failed on your resolution.

**00:03:28** But if you only get some other way,

**00:03:30** with the theme of the year of health,

**00:03:31** you've still made good progress.

**00:03:33** It also allows you to adapt throughout the year.

**00:03:36** Maybe instead of looking at weight or fitness,

**00:03:38** you look at mental health.

**00:03:39** It's still part of your health, and you can still

**00:03:41** make those positive steps towards what

**00:03:44** you want to be working on, rather than feeling

**00:03:47** like you have to have completed one very strict and set thing.

**00:03:50** Yeah, I like to think of it as a unifying idea for the year.

**00:03:55** This is a phrase that means something to you,

**00:03:57** and that you can have thoughts collect together

**00:04:00** underneath this umbrella.

**00:04:02** And I particularly like them, especially

**00:04:05** over the last couple of years, because they

**00:04:07** can be very flexible and adaptable,

**00:04:09** depending on what's going on in your life

**00:04:12** or what's going on in the world.

**00:04:13** And what I personally value about the yearly theme process

**00:04:18** is it gives me an opportunity to take stock of my life

**00:04:21** on a yearly basis and really think about what's working

**00:04:24** and what isn't and what I want to change about it.

**00:04:27** And then on these episodes, which we've

**00:04:29** been doing for five years, we assess

**00:04:31** how our previous theme has gone for the current year

**00:04:34** and talk about what worked, what didn't,

**00:04:36** and what we're going to set our new yearly theme to be.

**00:04:39** So that's what this episode is going to be today.

**00:04:41** All right.

**00:04:41** I thought we could maybe talk a little bit about how

**00:04:45** we choose our themes.

**00:04:47** Because I've made a note of it this year

**00:04:50** that I've established a process at this point.

**00:04:53** And it runs the whole year through.

**00:04:56** And then in the last couple of months of the year,

**00:04:58** it gets brought together.

**00:05:00** So I journal every day.

**00:05:03** As I'm journaling, I'm talking about how I'm feeling.

**00:05:05** I'm writing that down.

**00:05:07** And as we get maybe halfway through the year,

**00:05:10** I start to make mental note of the things

**00:05:13** that I find myself writing often.

**00:05:15** This could be like such and such things going well,

**00:05:18** such and such things as frustrating me, et cetera,

**00:05:20** et cetera.

**00:05:21** And as these things start to pop up more and more,

**00:05:25** I start to add some thoughts to an Apple note

**00:05:28** around October time.

**00:05:30** And so I create my yearly theme note for the next year.

**00:05:34** And I start adding lots of random thoughts and phrases

**00:05:37** and ideas.

**00:05:38** If I feel something about my work,

**00:05:40** even just randomly walking around the day,

**00:05:43** I have this thought, I just put it down.

**00:05:44** And I just start adding and adding and adding

**00:05:46** to this Apple note.

**00:05:48** And then what I actually did last week

**00:05:50** is I will open that note up and read back through everything

**00:05:53** and start to see what patterns are emerging.

**00:05:56** And I start to bring it all together

**00:05:58** and then can build a theme around it.

**00:06:00** So for me, it's very much a throwing everything in

**00:06:04** and seeing what is there.

**00:06:06** And then I use that to craft what my theme will be.

**00:06:08** Because a lot of the time,

**00:06:10** I'm talking about my frustrations in that note.

**00:06:13** And I start to see like, oh, actually,

**00:06:14** this could be related to this

**00:06:16** and this could be related to this.

**00:06:17** Let me craft something around that

**00:06:20** to see if I can try and make this part

**00:06:21** of my working life better.

**00:06:23** My traditional method has been something of a vision quest

**00:06:27** during summer travel under the stars that it comes to me.

**00:06:31** Obviously that didn't happen this year.

**00:06:32** So I've actually kind of cribbed

**00:06:34** because you mentioned this offhandedly last time we spoke

**00:06:37** about having a running note that you were adding stuff to.

**00:06:40** And since we spoke, I created a note in Obsidian

**00:06:44** and dumped just like a ton of thoughts that I'd had there

**00:06:48** and collected some little random stuff

**00:06:49** that I'd written down over the year in Apple notes

**00:06:51** and sort of put it together in one place.

**00:06:54** And I've been having that just open up automatically,

**00:06:58** just like in a little sidebar whenever I'm working

**00:07:00** in Obsidian on other projects so that I can see it there.

**00:07:03** It's interesting.

**00:07:04** I think I'm gonna continue this through the year

**00:07:07** because whenever we do these episodes,

**00:07:09** very often one of the questions people have is

**00:07:13** how do you keep reminding yourself about the theme

**00:07:17** over the course of the year?

**00:07:18** And I really like this as like having an always visible,

**00:07:26** like working document.

**00:07:28** So I think I'm gonna keep up with this little habit

**00:07:31** of just having a little narrow sidebar

**00:07:33** just when I first opened Obsidian,

**00:07:35** oh, here's that document about the year theme.

**00:07:38** And you can just look at it and think about it

**00:07:40** for a second and kind of remind yourself

**00:07:42** of what you wanna be doing.

**00:07:44** Yeah, a lot of people create a visual reminder.

**00:07:47** Like I know we have a lot of listeners

**00:07:49** that maybe make a desktop wallpaper

**00:07:51** that's related to their theme in some way,

**00:07:53** or they write it down on a piece of paper

**00:07:55** and stick it on the wall or put it on the whiteboard.

**00:07:58** Or honestly for me, do my journaling reminds me of it

**00:08:01** because it's written in the front of the journal.

**00:08:04** So I think about it.

**00:08:05** I think about my theme whenever I sit down

**00:08:07** to work on my theme system journal.

**00:08:09** But I think having some kind of reminder,

**00:08:12** whatever it is, is good, especially in the first,

**00:08:15** I would say three months of the year.

**00:08:17** It can be really helpful.

**00:08:19** So you're just internalizing what it is

**00:08:21** that you're working towards.

**00:08:23** Glenn, that sometimes in the beginning of the year,

**00:08:25** I struggle with the transition from one to the other.

**00:08:28** So having that reminder there is really helpful to me too.

**00:08:32** So shall we review our years, Mike?

**00:08:34** Yeah, can you remind me what your 2021 theme was?

**00:08:37** My 2021 theme was year of the voyage.

**00:08:40** I was wanting something that would be specifically flexible.

**00:08:44** So it had a dual meaning for me.

**00:08:46** It was voyage in the sense of the spaceship you video

**00:08:52** that I made about when you're in a constrained environment,

**00:08:55** maintaining the routine and the separate borders

**00:08:58** of your working spaces and your living spaces

**00:09:01** and your recreation spaces,

**00:09:03** that all of this is really important.

**00:09:05** So year of the voyage was partly about,

**00:09:07** hey, this whole situation isn't over yet.

**00:09:12** Don't lose track of what you're doing

**00:09:16** and sort of maintain the routines

**00:09:18** and what's worked so well for you in the past year.

**00:09:21** And then the flip side of year of the voyage

**00:09:24** was it was hugely important to me

**00:09:27** that no matter what happened over the rest of the year,

**00:09:30** I was going to find a way and make time

**00:09:34** to go visit my family in America

**00:09:36** because it had just been way too long.

**00:09:40** So normally, I wouldn't include a specific target

**00:09:45** like that in a theme.

**00:09:48** I think that does sort of go against

**00:09:50** what we set out in the beginning,

**00:09:52** but it was just too important for me not to do it.

**00:09:55** It was like, I'm going to make this happen

**00:09:58** and I don't care how much effort or how inconvenient

**00:10:01** or how much time I've got to make this happen

**00:10:04** and I'm deciding at the beginning of the year

**00:10:06** that this is going to be a thing,

**00:10:09** especially not knowing what is it going to look like

**00:10:12** in the future, doesn't matter.

**00:10:13** You have to make this happen one way or another.

**00:10:15** So that was my theme.

**00:10:17** I would rate year of the voyage as two thirds

**00:10:21** a big success and one third a failure.

**00:10:25** So the way my year went is that the first third

**00:10:29** was a big success in terms of year of the voyage.

**00:10:33** I did do what I set out to do,

**00:10:35** which is just maintain those routines,

**00:10:38** which I just thought were really important

**00:10:40** when you have a limited radius

**00:10:43** under which you're operating.

**00:10:44** But it did fall down in the middle,

**00:10:49** which I have labeled the swamp of uncertainty for my year.

**00:10:53** So I did have this, I mean, I can really pin it.

**00:10:57** The swamp of uncertainty started the moment

**00:11:00** I saw a particular shark statue in London

**00:11:04** and it ended the day that I uploaded

**00:11:10** the second unexpected Tiffany video.

**00:11:14** That is like the perfect bookends of

**00:11:17** when was this middle unhappy time of the year?

**00:11:21** Oh, sharks to Tiffany, that's when it was.

**00:11:23** Voyages can be affected by sharks.

**00:11:26** This is a wonderful thing.

**00:11:28** This is very true, yes.

**00:11:30** If your voyage is going to be affected,

**00:11:32** sharks are definitely a possibility.

**00:11:35** So I think there's many reasons why I kind of fell down

**00:11:38** in maintaining my routines and a whole bunch of my

**00:11:42** work structures that I had been really great about

**00:11:45** over the past year and a quarter just didn't hold up for me.

**00:11:49** Like it was a bit of a perfect storm

**00:11:51** of different intersecting things.

**00:11:55** And the main one is just this was the time of year

**00:11:58** when maybe the pandemic was coming to an end,

**00:12:03** but maybe not.

**00:12:04** And I kept trying to do the planning for going to America,

**00:12:08** but it kept having to get pushed back.

**00:12:10** And also both of these projects were extremely uncertain

**00:12:17** in how, if at all, are these videos going to be finished?

**00:12:22** They were both just unusually difficult,

**00:12:24** unusually uncertain projects.

**00:12:26** And then combined with the uncertainty about traveling,

**00:12:29** if I'm going to be here or not,

**00:12:32** it just ended up being like a really terrible time.

**00:12:35** And I'm gonna say something that sounds like so obvious

**00:12:39** it's going to sound really dumb,

**00:12:41** but I feel like I really in retrospect learned the lesson

**00:12:47** that you have to pay attention to when you're in

**00:12:53** an uncertain period of time.

**00:12:56** And this is when the routines are way more valuable,

**00:13:03** not way less valuable.

**00:13:06** So I think I started telling myself,

**00:13:10** oh, I don't need to make sure that I'm waking up

**00:13:13** at the same time because I might be in America

**00:13:17** in a few days and then it won't matter.

**00:13:18** Like I'm going to need to adjust the time anyway.

**00:13:21** And I think like there's always some lazy part

**00:13:25** of your brain, which is looking for excuses

**00:13:29** not to do the things that you know are good.

**00:13:32** And I think I've really come out the other side

**00:13:35** of the swamp of uncertainty with a very sharp sense

**00:13:40** of notice when this is happening and be aware

**00:13:46** that this is exactly the time to step up the alert

**00:13:50** of keeping your routines together

**00:13:53** and not like letting them slide

**00:13:56** because you think that they don't matter

**00:13:58** because this time is uncertain.

**00:14:00** No, this is the time it really matters.

**00:14:02** And I don't know, I think that sounds super obvious

**00:14:05** when I say it that way, but just going through

**00:14:08** the experience in this human way kind of made it more

**00:14:12** visceral to me than it's been in the past.

**00:14:16** It wasn't a great time, but I feel like I came out of it

**00:14:18** with a really clear lesson.

**00:14:22** And also as a little bit of a sidebar,

**00:14:25** this is one of the times when the journal really helps

**00:14:29** like our theme system journal really helped me

**00:14:30** kind of exit the swamp.

**00:14:32** I did a bunch of my tactical journaling

**00:14:35** at the end of the Tiffany project.

**00:14:38** And this is just thinking things through,

**00:14:42** having to put them down in words on paper,

**00:14:46** formulating like the set of questions

**00:14:49** that I want to be asking myself every day

**00:14:53** in the journal and like making a little note

**00:14:55** with the circles.

**00:14:56** All of this like really helped kind of pull me out of it

**00:14:59** and go, okay, you need to come back out of this time

**00:15:03** in one way or another.

**00:15:04** So it was very helpful there.

**00:15:06** So that was my like one third failure of the year,

**00:15:10** but it was in the middle.

**00:15:12** And then I did accomplish the main thing

**00:15:16** which was voyage to America.

**00:15:20** I don't have words to express how grateful I was

**00:15:24** for the experience that I was able to have

**00:15:26** with my family this summer.

**00:15:28** Obviously the circumstances that led up to it

**00:15:30** were terrible, but I would never have

**00:15:37** under normal circumstances been able to just dedicate

**00:15:42** that much time to family time.

**00:15:45** I think I ended up being with my parents,

**00:15:50** I mean, I have to double check the calendar at this point,

**00:15:51** but like something like six weeks and...

**00:15:54** Yeah, it was a long time.

**00:15:55** I haven't spent that much time with my parents

**00:15:58** since I lived with my parents back when I was in high school.

**00:16:03** Like it's really true.

**00:16:05** Like I was going back through and trying to like,

**00:16:06** oh, in college did I spend that much time?

**00:16:09** But it's like, actually, no,

**00:16:10** never that much time straight in a row.

**00:16:12** And it was just really fantastic.

**00:16:14** And you can't complain about that, right?

**00:16:16** I know that, you know, that maybe there's a world

**00:16:18** where if you wouldn't have had so much trouble

**00:16:20** with those two video projects

**00:16:22** that you wouldn't have stayed that long.

**00:16:24** Yeah, that is also true.

**00:16:26** I have a slight other note about that,

**00:16:27** which kind of contributed to that, but yes, for sure.

**00:16:30** Also, the fact that the swamp of uncertainty

**00:16:34** was a really bad time gave me good reason to just say,

**00:16:38** hey, chill out, man, relax for a while, just enjoy this.

**00:16:42** And also, as I mentioned with the journal,

**00:16:43** like, you know, one of the little, you know,

**00:16:45** check and review that you're doing this everyday things

**00:16:47** that I had at the back, like,

**00:16:50** I found it a really useful exercise

**00:16:52** just to order them from top to bottom of like,

**00:16:55** hey, the one that you write at the top

**00:16:57** is the one that you absolutely have to hit.

**00:17:00** Like, that is, there's no exception to that.

**00:17:01** And then they're in decreasing importance of like,

**00:17:04** okay, if you get down to, if you hit the 10th one,

**00:17:06** that's great, but it's not, you know,

**00:17:08** it's not a necessary one.

**00:17:09** And it's an interesting way of ordering the daily page.

**00:17:12** I never thought of it that way.

**00:17:13** Like, for me, they're all like of equal importance, really.

**00:17:15** Like, I just got to hit all of them.

**00:17:17** But that's a really interesting way of doing it,

**00:17:19** of like, descending in importance.

**00:17:22** Check these off if you get halfway through,

**00:17:24** you still done a good job kind of thing.

**00:17:25** That's interesting.

**00:17:26** Yeah, I'd never thought about it that way either.

**00:17:28** I think all the years we've been doing this,

**00:17:30** I thought of it the same way you did

**00:17:32** of them as being equally important.

**00:17:35** But I think I wasn't in a place

**00:17:37** where I could look at 10 things and be like,

**00:17:40** yeah, I'm gonna do all of these.

**00:17:41** Like, it was very, no, I'm not gonna do all of these.

**00:17:44** I like it.

**00:17:45** I might do something like that.

**00:17:47** Because I know I want to redo mine for next year,

**00:17:48** which I haven't done for a couple of years,

**00:17:50** but I'm not exactly sure how I'm gonna do that yet.

**00:17:52** So I might use this as a starting point.

**00:17:54** It's so interesting to me

**00:17:55** that you haven't changed them for a while.

**00:17:56** Like, I feel like that, to me,

**00:17:57** is actually one of the most valuable things

**00:18:01** is like rethinking those questions.

**00:18:03** Well, see, the way that I've used them

**00:18:05** is not so much for the theme.

**00:18:08** It's actually secondary to that part.

**00:18:10** It's like, you've always got to think about your theme.

**00:18:13** That's great.

**00:18:14** But there are these 10 set, this work for me,

**00:18:16** these nine set of things that you have to do

**00:18:18** just to make sure you're being

**00:18:20** the person you want to be every day.

**00:18:23** But I'm thinking I might start tweaking them up

**00:18:24** a little bit, because I have space for extra ones anyway.

**00:18:27** But you know, it's just basically like

**00:18:29** keeping in contact with your friends,

**00:18:31** be a good husband, right?

**00:18:32** Like add something to your business.

**00:18:34** That it's like, it's just for, they're very simple to me,

**00:18:37** but it's like, you've got to hit these every day.

**00:18:39** It's like, this is only the beginning of a successful day

**00:18:43** if you've hit a portion of all of this rather than,

**00:18:49** but I might switch it up because at this point,

**00:18:50** I've gotten pretty good at doing something

**00:18:52** in all of those areas.

**00:18:53** That makes sense.

**00:18:54** I would suggest trying it out in the ordering,

**00:18:56** like at least I was in the right mental space

**00:18:59** that this is exactly what worked for me.

**00:19:01** And the thing that I put right at the top

**00:19:05** was quality time with family.

**00:19:07** It's like, this is the whole reason I'm here.

**00:19:09** This is a big target for what had to happen

**00:19:13** with this theme for this year.

**00:19:15** And so it was great and it worked out just perfectly.

**00:19:19** And I mean, I've mentioned it before,

**00:19:21** but it was just a literally magical time

**00:19:25** teaching my mom how to play magic.

**00:19:27** And she would get obsessed at night and play the game.

**00:19:31** And then we'd wake up in the morning

**00:19:34** and she'd have just a ton of questions

**00:19:36** and we'd want to get right into it.

**00:19:37** And then my dad would be kind of laughing

**00:19:40** at the two obsessive weirdos.

**00:19:42** Look at these couple of nerds.

**00:19:45** Yeah, exactly.

**00:19:47** Doing this like for hours and hours.

**00:19:49** It was just great.

**00:19:50** I could not have asked for a better time.

**00:19:54** Like it was a peak experience of my adult life,

**00:19:57** the ability to spend so much time with my parents

**00:20:00** that I just haven't had in years.

**00:20:01** So it was unspeakably great

**00:20:04** and just a huge success for the end of the year

**00:20:09** with regards to the year of the voyage.

**00:20:14** I think that I know you,

**00:20:15** I can tell you you're a bit up and down on this one

**00:20:17** because you had a tough creative time,

**00:20:21** but ultimately that part, what you did at the end,

**00:20:24** that was the whole point of the year anyway,

**00:20:26** was like allowing you to get to a point

**00:20:28** where you were able to make a trip

**00:20:30** and you had such a good time on that trip.

**00:20:32** It feels like it was a full success to me.

**00:20:34** Your theme this year, like this was all of it.

**00:20:38** Like it was all laddering up to allowing you

**00:20:40** to be able to take this time and you did it

**00:20:42** and it was great and you've made the most of it.

**00:20:45** Yeah, I mean, even though I say

**00:20:47** I would regard the year as one third of failure,

**00:20:51** I also wouldn't do the year differently

**00:20:55** precisely because it all led

**00:20:56** to this perfect ending of the year.

**00:20:59** And also I have this funny experience

**00:21:01** where those two videos,

**00:21:03** sharks and the Tiffany video, particularly the second one,

**00:21:08** I almost never watch my old videos,

**00:21:11** but I really like those two.

**00:21:13** Like I actually think, oh, they came out great,

**00:21:15** both of them.

**00:21:16** And so that is still also a nice upside

**00:21:19** that oh, this unusually terrible working period

**00:21:23** has actually produced, I don't know,

**00:21:25** two of my real favorite videos.

**00:21:28** The videos, it's like this person almost killed me.

**00:21:31** It's that person almost, you don't wanna talk about it.

**00:21:33** Like the behind the scenes, that's a classic for me.

**00:21:36** Yeah, that's what I mean.

**00:21:37** It's that one and the sharks, I feel like.

**00:21:39** Those two are really great.

**00:21:41** Oh, okay.

**00:21:42** So you actually, cause when you say like the project,

**00:21:44** there was two videos that are project,

**00:21:45** but you mean the second one?

**00:21:47** Yeah, I mean the second one.

**00:21:48** Oh, okay then.

**00:21:48** Then yes, I agree.

**00:21:49** I think that the gray in the real world kind of video,

**00:21:54** that's I think my favorite video you've done this year.

**00:21:57** Clothes for me with sharks, I love sharks too.

**00:21:59** Yeah, so there's totally something to the tortured artist

**00:22:03** or it's like, oh boy, look at this great work

**00:22:06** that came out of someone's miserable time.

**00:22:10** We all just like to see you suffer.

**00:22:11** That's kind of it really.

**00:22:15** I look back on this year

**00:22:16** and I wouldn't do any of it differently

**00:22:18** because I think it all worked out,

**00:22:21** even the part of it that I would regard

**00:22:25** as kind of a failure in the middle.

**00:22:27** I'm still glad for it and it worked out.

**00:22:30** So that's my review of the 2020 year of the voyage.

**00:22:34** 2021.

**00:22:36** Oh my God, Mike.

**00:22:39** This episode of Cortex is brought to you by FitBod.

**00:22:42** It's super normal for people to start considering

**00:22:45** their health and fitness around this time of year.

**00:22:47** But between balancing work, family

**00:22:49** and everything else you have going on,

**00:22:51** it can sometimes be hard to make fitness a priority.

**00:22:55** What you need is a program that works with you,

**00:22:58** not against you.

**00:22:59** And that's why you need FitBod.

**00:23:26** and you'll see the results that you're looking for.

**00:23:40** Fitness is an important part of a lot of people's themes.

**00:23:43** It's going to be a part of mine.

**00:23:45** FitBod has been one of the catalysts

**00:23:47** that really got me on this train this past year

**00:23:49** and is gonna continue throughout the next year.

**00:23:52** It's really easy to get started

**00:23:53** and it gives you the confidence that you need

**00:23:58** It makes it so easy, it makes it so simple

**00:24:01** to be able to get started

**00:24:02** and feel confident in what you're doing.

**00:24:04** It really is honestly life-changing.

**00:25:13** How was your 2021?

**00:25:14** I was so apprehensive of sitting down to do this part.

**00:25:19** Oh yeah?

**00:25:20** I don't know what it, I feel like I hadn't done a good job.

**00:25:23** In my mind, I was like, I just felt like I had not done

**00:25:25** a good job with my yearly theme

**00:25:27** and I didn't wanna re-listen to the part of the episode

**00:25:31** last year where I spoke about what I wanted my theme to be.

**00:25:35** Like I was really putting it off and putting it off

**00:25:38** but once I actually sat down and went through it,

**00:25:41** I felt better about it than I had initially anticipated

**00:25:45** I would and I think really for me, the reason for this was

**00:25:50** I had lost sight of the fact that my yearly theme this year

**00:25:55** was more about setting groundwork for future years

**00:26:00** and put way too much stock in about the way that I'm feeling

**00:26:04** towards the end of the year of Overwhelm

**00:26:06** when really it actually kind of makes sense

**00:26:08** and I think it was just in our episode last year,

**00:26:11** we spoke a lot about how big my theme was

**00:26:14** and we spoke about how there was

**00:26:16** this element of groundwork

**00:26:18** and so listening back to it made me remember that

**00:26:20** and I felt a bit better about it.

**00:26:22** Remind me, what was the name?

**00:26:23** The Year of Reinvention.

**00:26:25** Right, right, right.

**00:26:27** And I think maybe I suffered with a bad name in the end

**00:26:31** because I'm not reinvented but that wasn't the point.

**00:26:35** The point was to start that process

**00:26:39** and I think I kind of got lost in the idea of like,

**00:26:41** well, I'm not a changed man

**00:26:43** because that takes a while

**00:26:45** but the Year of Reinvention was more about

**00:26:48** setting some steps in place to move towards

**00:26:51** changing a lot of my work life

**00:26:53** and I do feel that now that I've actually sat down

**00:26:56** and done the review,

**00:26:57** which is why I think it's important to do the review

**00:26:58** because now I've changed my perspective on my year,

**00:27:01** I feel like I have actually set myself on the path

**00:27:04** to being this future progression of who I wanna be

**00:27:07** and I've moved everything forward.

**00:27:09** Nothing's completed from the year,

**00:27:10** everything's just moved forward

**00:27:12** in the direction that I wanted

**00:27:13** and I feel like I made some meaningful progress.

**00:27:15** Can you give me some examples?

**00:27:17** Yeah, so I had a bunch of objectives of like things,

**00:27:20** areas that I wanted to focus my attention on.

**00:27:23** One was completing MegaStudio

**00:27:26** and this was kind of like my,

**00:27:27** I'm going to America that you have,

**00:27:30** of like there is actually,

**00:27:32** I believed an endpoint to this when I started it

**00:27:34** but it actually turned out that that wasn't the case

**00:27:37** as the year went on.

**00:27:38** So one thing that I loved about

**00:27:40** when thinking about my studio is I spent the full year

**00:27:43** there this year, which I had not done previously.

**00:27:46** So I was able to work there as much as I wanted

**00:27:49** for an entire calendar year

**00:27:52** and I would say at this point,

**00:27:53** the studio is kind of as complete

**00:27:56** as I would feasibly want it for now.

**00:27:58** There's like a couple of items of furniture

**00:28:00** that would be nice to have

**00:28:01** but ultimately what this year has done

**00:28:04** is proven what we really want in an outside space

**00:28:07** that at the moment, MegaStudio only really works for me,

**00:28:11** it doesn't work for me and Adina.

**00:28:13** And so now it's kind of like,

**00:28:17** all right, like we've worked out the way

**00:28:19** that we would want to have an outside studio space

**00:28:22** and ultimately we do need it to have a couple of rooms

**00:28:26** or at least one office room for me to record in

**00:28:29** and then a larger space

**00:28:30** and also like our own bathroom, our own kitchen

**00:28:33** which is all stuff we have to share

**00:28:34** in the building that we're in right now.

**00:28:36** So really, I don't think 2022 is the year

**00:28:40** where we actually change this

**00:28:42** but it will be the year where we start to put some plans

**00:28:45** in place for maybe 2023 of moving to a new studio space.

**00:28:51** But having MegaStudio has been the biggest,

**00:28:55** most positive change to my work in maybe five years.

**00:28:59** Really?

**00:29:00** I love it.

**00:29:01** I love having a place that I go to

**00:29:05** and I do all my work there and I come home

**00:29:08** and I don't do any more work.

**00:29:11** This sounds so simple.

**00:29:13** It sounds so simple but I...

**00:29:15** No, I get it.

**00:29:17** I had worked for so many years

**00:29:19** just in the second bedroom of the house and the living room

**00:29:22** which kind of just meant I worked everywhere

**00:29:24** all the time whenever.

**00:29:25** And there was just something so nice

**00:29:28** about having that space.

**00:29:30** There are so many things that I do.

**00:29:32** There are things that I don't do

**00:29:33** because of having this place of like,

**00:29:36** well, I could record this extra show

**00:29:38** but it means I have to go to the studio on the weekend

**00:29:40** and I don't wanna do that so I'm not gonna do it.

**00:29:42** That kind of stuff has just been so great for me.

**00:29:45** And while I do still have the emergency gear at home,

**00:29:49** I don't like to use it.

**00:29:50** I can still edit at home if I want to

**00:29:53** but I don't really want to.

**00:29:54** I wanna go to the studio and do it

**00:29:55** because I like the environment more.

**00:29:57** It just feels nicer, it's bigger, it's more open.

**00:30:00** There's more light, there's more air.

**00:30:03** I have some space, I have things set up

**00:30:05** in like a comfortable way.

**00:30:06** I don't feel like I'm cramped in.

**00:30:08** It really has been super good.

**00:30:10** So I'm really happy for it

**00:30:12** and I'm also happy that we have had this space.

**00:30:16** It hasn't been too much of a disruption

**00:30:18** and it's allowed us to learn more of what we would want

**00:30:22** in a future space.

**00:30:23** Like it's been a good first step

**00:30:24** in having an out of home office.

**00:30:27** I really love having a commute again,

**00:30:29** like all these little things which I just,

**00:30:31** I'd let them go for like seven years it had been

**00:30:34** since I'd had this in my working life

**00:30:37** and I've really have enjoyed the change.

**00:30:39** Like when I think about myself now,

**00:30:41** I was like a kid when I used to do the commute and stuff.

**00:30:44** I didn't really know what I wanted then.

**00:30:46** Like I was in my twenties

**00:30:48** and I was still kind of working stuff out

**00:30:51** and I also hated what I did

**00:30:52** and didn't see any of the value

**00:30:54** that can be drawn from that.

**00:30:56** And so now I feel like I've grown up

**00:30:59** and I've changed so much.

**00:31:00** Having that separation and everything that comes with it

**00:31:04** I think works pretty nicely for me.

**00:31:06** So very happy with that part.

**00:31:07** I imagine a lot of people have recently realized

**00:31:11** that the commute and the physical separation of space,

**00:31:16** there's a lot of advantages to that.

**00:31:18** And while you might think,

**00:31:20** oh, I don't wanna have to do that

**00:31:22** and it's nice to not have to,

**00:31:24** there are some big advantages for having a place

**00:31:28** that you go to, which is the work

**00:31:31** and then you have a transition back home

**00:31:33** and the work is not done at home.

**00:31:36** It's a huge psychological advantage.

**00:31:38** And I have no doubt that it's like a similar thing

**00:31:41** is there's just been a bunch of people

**00:31:42** that have realized they want the exact opposite

**00:31:44** and I don't know if they've had it.

**00:31:45** And this is more kind of like,

**00:31:46** I've just had that experience the same as everybody else

**00:31:49** but in a different way

**00:31:50** because it wasn't COVID related,

**00:31:53** me getting the studio,

**00:31:54** but I've just had a similar experience to many people

**00:31:57** of having had a change in the way of where I work

**00:32:01** and I've learned something new that I love from it.

**00:32:03** It's interesting to hear you say that your review

**00:32:06** is more successful than you thought going through it

**00:32:09** because this is also a case where when you say

**00:32:12** you spent a full year at the studio, I think,

**00:32:15** no Mike, surely that can't be true.

**00:32:17** You've only recently gone, but that's not true.

**00:32:20** I didn't realize this until I sat down to do the review.

**00:32:23** This is the exact reason why it's super useful

**00:32:26** to actually write down and track things

**00:32:29** because if you had asked me how long you've been

**00:32:31** in the studio, I would say, oh, a couple of months at most.

**00:32:34** Just a couple of months.

**00:32:37** Yeah.

**00:32:38** Yeah.

**00:32:38** So like I'm really happy to hear that that both

**00:32:40** that you've done it and also way more importantly

**00:32:44** at the end of the year during the review,

**00:32:47** you realize that you've done it.

**00:32:49** Yeah, that's the most important part.

**00:32:51** Yeah, that is way more important in some ways.

**00:32:54** If a tree falls down in the studio

**00:32:56** and no one's around to hear it,

**00:32:57** was I ever at the studio in the first place?

**00:33:00** I don't know.

**00:33:01** It's an unanswerable question.

**00:33:02** These are life's great mysteries.

**00:33:04** What isn't a mystery though is I did visit your studio

**00:33:07** and it is awesome.

**00:33:08** Like I'm so jealous of it.

**00:33:11** It is crazy to me that you're thinking about a mega-er studio

**00:33:16** in the future on a 2023 timeline,

**00:33:20** but hearing you talk it through, it totally makes sense.

**00:33:23** Yeah, I don't need more space.

**00:33:25** Like the amount of space that we have is great.

**00:33:27** It's like more than enough.

**00:33:28** We just need it to be separated.

**00:33:29** And there isn't really a great way to separate

**00:33:32** what we currently have because the ceilings are so high,

**00:33:35** like putting in any kind of fake walls or petitions,

**00:33:37** it's just not going to do the job.

**00:33:38** But hey, if you like my studio so much,

**00:33:40** the unit next door is available.

**00:33:42** It's too long of a commute.

**00:33:43** Otherwise, Mike, I would, but it's too long of a commute.

**00:33:45** For you it is.

**00:33:47** For you it is.

**00:33:47** For me it's great.

**00:33:48** It really feels like your place with the way everything

**00:33:51** is set up with the equipment, the way things are laid out,

**00:33:55** the way it's designed, your adorable little like quarantine

**00:33:59** space taped out in the beginning.

**00:34:01** That is an adena invention.

**00:34:03** The whole thing is great.

**00:34:05** I just love it.

**00:34:06** So I'm very happy that you've spent the year there.

**00:34:08** And I'm also very happy that I was able to actually see it

**00:34:11** in person and check it out.

**00:34:13** And yeah, it's great.

**00:34:15** I'm so happy that you did that.

**00:34:16** And you've got space for all your stuff.

**00:34:19** So one of the other things was doing something new.

**00:34:22** And again, I feel like I've ticked this box quite a lot

**00:34:25** with keyboard related stuff and Twitch streaming.

**00:34:28** I've really been loving this.

**00:34:29** It's one of my favorite things that I've done in 2021.

**00:34:32** I stream basically once a week and I have a great set

**00:34:37** of people that hang out and we build keyboards

**00:34:41** and customize keyboards.

**00:34:42** And it's just been a really great hobby.

**00:34:45** And I've loved learning the new skills that come from it.

**00:34:48** And that comes from learning streaming stuff

**00:34:52** and also just learning how to do these electronics projects.

**00:34:56** Basically we stream every Friday.

**00:34:58** And I really liked that it's at the end of the week.

**00:35:00** And it's one of the things that I look forward

**00:35:03** to the most in my week.

**00:35:04** And I'm also really happy that after having done this

**00:35:08** for basically a year, it still just feels very much

**00:35:11** in the hobby camp.

**00:35:12** It never moved over into work.

**00:35:14** It doesn't feel like it at all.

**00:35:16** It just feels like something that I do to just hang out

**00:35:18** with some people and just spend some time,

**00:35:21** some fixed time doing something that's just for me

**00:35:23** that I enjoy that I don't think I otherwise would have.

**00:35:27** I think if I didn't have the idea

**00:35:29** that I'm gonna stream it, if it wasn't on my calendar,

**00:35:32** I wouldn't spend the time doing it.

**00:35:34** But this is also something that if I have a spare moment

**00:35:36** to myself, I might tinker with something for a bit.

**00:35:39** But having the time on my calendar every week

**00:35:42** to sit down and play with this stuff,

**00:35:43** I think has been really valuable.

**00:35:44** And I'm really proud of the skills that I've learned

**00:35:48** over the last year with this.

**00:35:50** That's all you need to do.

**00:35:51** No editing of any kind is really good.

**00:35:54** I don't make YouTube videos about the keyboards either.

**00:35:57** Which is something that I could do if I wanted to.

**00:35:59** I could make a YouTube review of a keyboard,

**00:36:02** but I don't wanna do it

**00:36:03** because then it's just gonna feel like work.

**00:36:05** So spontaneity of it and the fact that not really,

**00:36:08** I don't really prepare.

**00:36:10** Like I'm not sitting down and writing down ideas

**00:36:11** from my streams and just,

**00:36:13** I might have like a thing I wanna do,

**00:36:14** but it's a totally different thing.

**00:36:15** Oh, I wanna work on this project on Friday.

**00:36:18** Great, I'll get it ready and then I'll go for it.

**00:36:20** But it's not, none of the processes that I go through

**00:36:24** for my podcast recording at all crossover into this.

**00:36:29** I can't even use a completely different computer for it all.

**00:36:31** I can use my gaming PC or my streaming PC.

**00:36:33** Like it's all different.

**00:36:34** I have a different part of my studio for it.

**00:36:36** It's all very, like this is just what this is for.

**00:36:40** And I think that that separation of it

**00:36:42** has made it feel just really great.

**00:36:43** And it just continues to just feel like a fun project,

**00:36:46** not a work project.

**00:36:48** Yeah, cause you do have that desk

**00:36:49** that's on the opposite wall for this.

**00:36:51** I didn't realize that was your gaming computer.

**00:36:53** Yeah, it's kind of split into two

**00:36:55** and like it's a really large desk

**00:36:57** and the left side of the desk is just streaming

**00:36:59** and keyboard related stuff.

**00:37:00** And then the right side of the desk

**00:37:02** is kind of where I will spend most of my time working

**00:37:04** where I'm not recording.

**00:37:06** Cause the desk is just huge.

**00:37:08** So it works great for it.

**00:37:09** Like I've got these kinds of two stations

**00:37:11** that I set out at the studio though.

**00:37:13** Yeah, but you can split a desk in two

**00:37:15** and make one side the one side

**00:37:17** and the other side the other side.

**00:37:19** But I just, I think I didn't realize

**00:37:20** that the computer over there is also the gaming computer.

**00:37:23** I feel like that's a really good way to do it

**00:37:25** so that it's just clearly like,

**00:37:27** oh, this is where I do the fun stuff.

**00:37:29** And that includes the keyboards

**00:37:30** and it's not the, it's not professionalizing it.

**00:37:33** That's interesting.

**00:37:34** Finding that Windows is where I do all my fun.

**00:37:36** Mac OS is where all the work happens.

**00:37:39** Yeah, but isn't that how everybody thinks

**00:37:42** of the operating systems?

**00:37:42** Windows is for funsies and Mac is serious and button down.

**00:37:48** I think that's the right thing.

**00:37:49** I think that's the long standing understanding

**00:37:52** of those two, yeah, I think you're right.

**00:37:54** So I have a few more.

**00:37:55** Building new norms was the thing that I wanted to do.

**00:37:58** And I still think that I've got work to do on this.

**00:38:02** One of the things that I spoke about

**00:38:03** and I feel very set in is less overall travel.

**00:38:06** I do not envision ever going back

**00:38:08** to my 2019 travel amounts in a year.

**00:38:11** And one of the things that I really wanna focus on

**00:38:14** is different travel to what I was doing before.

**00:38:18** So basically more travel for pleasure, less for work,

**00:38:21** which means vacations.

**00:38:23** I only took one vacation in 2021.

**00:38:25** It's incredible.

**00:38:26** I'm actually at the end of it.

**00:38:27** I'm on it.

**00:38:28** I'm on it now.

**00:38:30** But I let that go way too long before I did this.

**00:38:33** Basically the entire year.

**00:38:36** The last vacation that I took was in January, 2020.

**00:38:39** And then in end of November, 2021, that was stupid, honestly.

**00:38:44** To do that, I didn't need to do it.

**00:38:47** I felt like I had to do it, but I didn't.

**00:38:49** I could have taken more time off in the year and a half,

**00:38:53** the two years, but I didn't do that.

**00:38:55** And I feel like this trip has reminded me

**00:38:59** of the value of proper vacations.

**00:39:02** And so I'm not gonna let that happen again.

**00:39:05** Yeah, I think you're a little hard on yourself

**00:39:07** for going so long without a vacation in this period of time.

**00:39:13** Like, I don't know.

**00:39:14** I think you're a little harsh on yourself with that.

**00:39:16** And it's extremely understandable why.

**00:39:17** I could have taken a week.

**00:39:19** I could have taken a week or a couple of long weekends.

**00:39:22** Like, I could have done that.

**00:39:23** Yes.

**00:39:24** But I didn't do any of that.

**00:39:25** You're not wrong.

**00:39:27** I think it's a very understandable time period

**00:39:29** for that to have happened.

**00:39:30** But yeah, you're not wrong that if you're thinking about it

**00:39:33** in terms of a week, you could have done that.

**00:39:34** If this was just random time,

**00:39:37** then I would be way more upset at myself.

**00:39:39** Like, I would just think that I was an idiot.

**00:39:41** Like if it's just like-

**00:39:42** And then I would 100% agree.

**00:39:44** 2017 to 2018, I just didn't take any of it again.

**00:39:47** She's like, what is wrong with you?

**00:39:48** Well, I didn't.

**00:39:49** So, you know, I've learned that going forward

**00:39:52** I need to do this.

**00:39:54** It's very important to me.

**00:39:55** I feel so much more refreshed about going into next year

**00:39:59** than I did like two weeks ago.

**00:40:02** You know, two weeks ago, my whole world was crumbling down.

**00:40:04** You know, like, and now I feel much better.

**00:40:07** Like, I'm going like as well.

**00:40:09** When I get home, I am like crash landing

**00:40:12** into a busy work period, but I feel more prepared for it.

**00:40:16** In a way that if this was just the amount of work

**00:40:19** that I've had starting Monday from a regular week,

**00:40:23** I would feel absolutely terrible.

**00:40:25** But now she's like, no, this is just a busy,

**00:40:27** I've just got like a busy couple of weeks

**00:40:29** before Christmas starts and it's fine, you know?

**00:40:32** I'm going to be able to handle it.

**00:40:33** I've built up enough energy now, I'm ready to go.

**00:40:37** But that's because I've taken this time

**00:40:40** and it's been very valuable for me.

**00:40:41** So I'm not going to let it happen again where,

**00:40:45** I mean, really it's like, it's also the prioritization

**00:40:47** of relaxing time, of overworking time

**00:40:50** is one of the big things that I'm going to focus on

**00:40:52** when it comes to travel now.

**00:40:55** Can I ask what the reasons are for less work travel?

**00:40:58** Like, is it specific?

**00:41:00** Like, I think this is good, right?

**00:41:02** That you're saying, oh, you want to travel different,

**00:41:05** more vacations, less work.

**00:41:07** But what's the reasoning for the decrease in the work?

**00:41:11** Working travel is just for me.

**00:41:14** Vacations are for me and my partner.

**00:41:18** And if I'm just traveling for work,

**00:41:20** I get an enjoyment out of that.

**00:41:22** I get a refreshment out of that.

**00:41:24** But it's only benefiting me.

**00:41:28** And I don't think that's fair.

**00:41:30** And it's not that I won't do this stuff, I will.

**00:41:33** But basically all of my travel prior to the pandemic

**00:41:37** was just for work stuff.

**00:41:40** There needs to be a way different balance for that.

**00:41:44** And also, I do get more benefit out of pure vacations.

**00:41:49** And I can mix these things up, right?

**00:41:51** And I have, like this trip has been vastly vacation,

**00:41:54** but I've recorded a couple of shows.

**00:41:57** We've met with some friends and stuff

**00:41:59** and friends that I also work with, right?

**00:42:00** So there's always that mix there.

**00:42:03** But the way that this is balanced

**00:42:04** has been way more vacation.

**00:42:06** It's right, like we've been away for like 17 days

**00:42:09** and there's been maybe two days

**00:42:11** where there's been work stuff going on.

**00:42:13** That's been really good.

**00:42:14** That's vacation, I've enjoyed it immensely.

**00:42:16** And I think it's important for me to have that time as well.

**00:42:20** So that's what I kind of want to focus on going forward.

**00:42:23** And I feel like I've set that up.

**00:42:24** This is one of those things where like I was thinking,

**00:42:27** well, I don't really feel like I have a plan

**00:42:29** for what this stuff looks like, but it's fine.

**00:42:32** Because I've started taking the steps this year

**00:42:34** to enable that to occur in future years.

**00:42:36** You know, like this is one of the areas where I feel like,

**00:42:38** well, but I don't really have an idea of what I want

**00:42:42** when it comes to like new norms.

**00:42:43** Because it's more than just travel, it's a lot of things.

**00:42:46** Really, I do feel like my mindset has changed this year,

**00:42:50** where I feel like I am in a space where I feel like

**00:42:54** I'm open to changing things that I have otherwise felt

**00:42:58** with just the way that things were.

**00:43:02** And so now I feel like I'm much more open in future years

**00:43:05** to adapting what my life looks like.

**00:43:09** There were a couple of other things that I can breeze

**00:43:12** through, I think.

**00:43:13** Direct support was one, and I'm super happy

**00:43:15** with how membership's been going.

**00:43:16** The base and security that is provided

**00:43:18** has been really wonderful.

**00:43:19** Like it's just, you know, now I do feel like I have a level

**00:43:22** of security in my income that I didn't have before.

**00:43:25** And in a time which still continues to be in flux,

**00:43:28** like the advertising part of the business

**00:43:30** is always up and down.

**00:43:31** It's been up and down all of 2021.

**00:43:33** And I continue, I reckon it's gonna continue

**00:43:36** to be the same, global supply chain, et cetera, et cetera.

**00:43:39** So having the direct support model and the membership

**00:43:42** has been really great.

**00:43:43** And I do feel like this year, I've gotten a much better handle

**00:43:47** on what the content is and what goes where

**00:43:50** for the shows where I do this stuff.

**00:43:52** So I've been really happy with that.

**00:43:53** And I feel like I've gotten the mix under control,

**00:43:56** which I'm really pleased with.

**00:43:57** I wanted to think about my relationship to the internet.

**00:44:01** I don't really feel like I've done anything different here.

**00:44:04** I know I use Twitter less, but I still debate

**00:44:07** as to whether I wanna use it at all,

**00:44:09** but cannot get let go of my grip on it.

**00:44:13** So that's just, I think it's just gonna continue

**00:44:15** to be a ongoing question in my mind.

**00:44:18** I feel like my news intake is far better.

**00:44:21** Like I feel better informed.

**00:44:22** And I also feel like I have way better filters for myself.

**00:44:25** I was like, I see a news story.

**00:44:27** And I feel like I'm better at filtering it

**00:44:29** through my own brain and like working out

**00:44:32** what I think it means rather than what it tells me it means,

**00:44:35** which I think has been a valuable skill that I've learned.

**00:44:39** Okay.

**00:44:40** Honestly, this is mostly to headlines.

**00:44:41** Like I feel like I'm handling headlines way better.

**00:44:45** Like I see a headline and I'm like,

**00:44:47** I don't think this is true.

**00:44:48** And then I read the story and I'm like,

**00:44:49** oh yeah, no, they were inflating that.

**00:44:52** Like I feel like I've gotten a way better sense,

**00:44:54** a gut sense of this stuff, which I'm pretty happy with.

**00:44:57** And the last area was product development.

**00:45:01** And this was one of the ones where I was like,

**00:45:04** but I didn't do the thing I wanted to do.

**00:45:06** Like we've been working on a new project

**00:45:08** and it's something quite new and ambitious

**00:45:11** compared to what we've been doing.

**00:45:12** It's in the same ballpark,

**00:45:14** but it was really starting something completely from scratch.

**00:45:17** And it's been in development for a year.

**00:45:20** And I really wanted to have it for sale now,

**00:45:23** but there have been unexpected stumbling blocks.

**00:45:25** But ultimately the product is becoming better and better

**00:45:28** the longer we continue working on it.

**00:45:30** That was something I really wanted to have something else

**00:45:33** this year, but it just wasn't able to be worked out.

**00:45:36** Yeah, I know that was your target for this,

**00:45:39** but this also I think is a case where you did heroically

**00:45:44** under the circumstances for how far along this product is.

**00:45:47** So I think you still get full points for this,

**00:45:50** even though, yeah, we wanted ideally

**00:45:53** to be announcing a new thing now,

**00:45:54** but just the realities of the world

**00:45:56** and not allow that to happen.

**00:45:57** And yeah, so I think I'm giving you full points

**00:46:00** for product development for sure this year,

**00:46:03** even though it's gonna be a little bit later

**00:46:04** than we otherwise anticipated.

**00:46:06** So this is kind of where I am with the theme of like,

**00:46:10** nothing major happened,

**00:46:12** but movement was in all of these areas.

**00:46:16** And so that's why like in my review, I realized,

**00:46:18** oh, you know what, I did a better job of this

**00:46:20** than I thought I did.

**00:46:21** And so after completing the kind of looking back,

**00:46:24** I felt pretty good in it,

**00:46:25** but it just maybe this wasn't really a theme

**00:46:29** that like I've had before,

**00:46:31** where I felt like where they kind of was like,

**00:46:34** oh, when I'm done with this,

**00:46:35** I know I'm gonna feel different.

**00:46:36** That's how kind of every other theme has been for me.

**00:46:38** And it's actually my theme for 2022 is focused around that.

**00:46:43** But really 2021's theme,

**00:46:45** I should have actually given it a different kind of name.

**00:46:48** It should have been like the year of groundwork

**00:46:49** or something or the year of foundation

**00:46:51** rather than the year of reinvention.

**00:46:53** That phrase really threw me off

**00:46:55** as I was going through the year.

**00:46:56** And I don't think it did a good job with the name

**00:46:59** because the reinvention seemed to suggest that

**00:47:02** by the end of it, I'm a new man.

**00:47:04** It's not as simple as that.

**00:47:06** Because by the end of it,

**00:47:07** I have actually set myself up to become a new man,

**00:47:10** but that's gonna be a longer process.

**00:47:13** And so if I could go back,

**00:47:15** I would actually call this the year of foundation

**00:47:17** or the year of groundwork.

**00:47:18** And I feel like that would have made me feel way different

**00:47:21** about the theme overall.

**00:47:22** I think it was just poorly branded.

**00:47:25** How are you even debating between those two names?

**00:47:28** Foundation is such an awesome name for a theme.

**00:47:31** That's gotta go on the list for people of like,

**00:47:34** hey, are you considering a theme?

**00:47:36** How does foundation sound to you?

**00:47:38** Like that's great.

**00:47:39** I might go back and re-edit the episode.

**00:47:41** Just like every time, foundation just comes in

**00:47:44** every time, year of foundation, really bad ADR.

**00:47:49** Yeah, that's a fantastic theme name.

**00:47:52** That's definitely gotta go on the list of suggestions

**00:47:54** for sure.

**00:47:55** And it's gotta be in bold.

**00:47:56** That's the only way to say it.

**00:47:57** Oh, what's your theme?

**00:47:58** Foundation.

**00:47:59** No, even year of or anything.

**00:48:01** That's such a good one.

**00:48:04** It breaks out.

**00:48:05** Take that people and go run with it.

**00:48:07** And you know what the best way to run with it is?

**00:48:09** Oh, there he goes.

**00:48:11** By buying a journal.

**00:48:12** Theme system.

**00:48:14** Contextmerch.com.

**00:48:17** So we've been talking about the theme system journal a bit

**00:48:20** and this is where we're gonna pitch you

**00:48:22** on why this is important.

**00:48:23** So.

**00:48:24** Yes.

**00:48:25** The journaling part of the theme

**00:48:27** is a very, very important part for me

**00:48:29** because it gives me the ability to take some time

**00:48:32** to look at myself every day, think about how I'm doing,

**00:48:36** think about what I'm focusing on,

**00:48:37** think about what I want to change.

**00:48:39** Not only does it keep me on track with my theme,

**00:48:42** it serves as a reminder for my theme

**00:48:44** and also helps me plan my next one.

**00:48:46** This is what I mentioned earlier

**00:48:47** that my practice of journaling every day

**00:48:50** helps me highlight the areas in my working and personal life

**00:48:54** that I want to change for the future.

**00:48:56** I see what keeps popping up.

**00:48:57** For me, like for example, a really good one,

**00:49:00** and I'm gonna talk about this in a bit,

**00:49:01** I have a section in my journal every day

**00:49:03** where I talk about something that was bad in my day

**00:49:05** or something that's frustrating me.

**00:49:07** Far too often I wrote, I feel like I'm too busy

**00:49:10** or I feel like I'm overwhelmed.

**00:49:11** I kept noticing that I was writing that a lot.

**00:49:14** So it was like, okay, I need to address that.

**00:49:17** And it's a thing that I feel like if I wasn't writing it down,

**00:49:20** if I wasn't like verbalizing it,

**00:49:22** I don't think I will be able to pin exactly what it is

**00:49:24** that was making me feel not great,

**00:49:26** but I was realizing it was overwhelming.

**00:49:28** And it was the practice of journaling every day

**00:49:31** that helped me uncover this feeling,

**00:49:34** which I can then use for creating my next theme.

**00:49:38** So I really love it for that stuff.

**00:49:40** I'm still gonna make the pitch

**00:49:42** that I'm thinking of a younger version of me

**00:49:46** who would be listening to this.

**00:49:49** And listening to your pitch

**00:49:52** that you would do this every day over a long period of time,

**00:49:58** younger version of me knows he's not gonna do that.

**00:50:01** And so I still make the pitch that like

**00:50:03** what the journal is great for me for is this tactical journaling.

**00:50:09** I like it because it's over time,

**00:50:12** it's become much more like an object,

**00:50:15** which is the, hey, you're serious now object

**00:50:20** of you want to change something

**00:50:24** and you're going to intentionally work on it with this thing.

**00:50:29** And like I really do mean it,

**00:50:31** like it helped bring me out of a funk

**00:50:33** at the end of the swamp of uncertainty

**00:50:36** by just going through writing down the items

**00:50:40** that I wanted to track every day,

**00:50:42** prioritizing them by what matters,

**00:50:44** like what are the things that I absolutely need

**00:50:47** and want to do.

**00:50:48** This time in particular,

**00:50:49** I really liked the exercise of thinking through

**00:50:52** what counts as a full circle

**00:50:55** and what counts as a half circle

**00:50:57** for like partial credit for this thing

**00:51:00** and full credit for this thing.

**00:51:02** And I find using it really intensely

**00:51:06** for a period of one to two to three weeks,

**00:51:11** it never fails to help really change my mental mindset.

**00:51:17** I just love it for this.

**00:51:19** I think you're making a really good example

**00:51:21** of why our product is good

**00:51:23** because we create this product together

**00:51:25** and we use it completely differently

**00:51:27** because that's how we made it.

**00:51:29** We made it to be customizable,

**00:51:32** that it fits into how you want to work.

**00:51:34** Maybe you want to journal every day,

**00:51:36** maybe you just want to pick it up

**00:51:37** for a three week period to journal

**00:51:39** and it works because we don't date it.

**00:51:41** It's not meant to make you feel bad

**00:51:44** because you don't address it every day.

**00:51:46** Yeah, we definitely use it differently

**00:51:48** because and also it is just very funny.

**00:51:50** Every time you mention that thing

**00:51:51** about where you write down something that didn't go well,

**00:51:54** I hate that.

**00:51:55** I hate that so much.

**00:51:57** I'm always like, don't do that.

**00:52:00** That's a terrible idea.

**00:52:02** But you know what?

**00:52:03** The point is it works for you.

**00:52:05** Whereas like my pitch instead

**00:52:06** for those two boxes at the top,

**00:52:09** especially if you want to like elevate your mood

**00:52:12** is the thing that always annoys me

**00:52:14** with how effective it is,

**00:52:15** which is like writing down things you're grateful for.

**00:52:18** And it's like, it makes me so angry how effective it is.

**00:52:22** But it's like the top box in the morning,

**00:52:26** write something that you're grateful for.

**00:52:27** And the next little box right below it,

**00:52:30** save it for the end of the day.

**00:52:32** And at the end of the day,

**00:52:34** write something that went well during the day.

**00:52:36** And it's like, God damn it.

**00:52:38** It sounds so dumb, but it is so effective.

**00:52:41** It's like, I recommend people,

**00:52:43** they can go to themesystem.com

**00:52:46** and we have examples of what people write

**00:52:48** in the journaling pages.

**00:52:49** And these examples are actually built on these two ways

**00:52:52** that we journal.

**00:52:53** So there is like, there's one from me

**00:52:55** where in the four boxes, I write something that's good,

**00:52:58** something that's bad.

**00:52:59** What am I thinking about?

**00:53:00** What am I looking forward to?

**00:53:02** And then there's one that you came up with

**00:53:04** what you're personally grateful for,

**00:53:06** professionally grateful for, what's on your mind

**00:53:08** and what's your most important task, right?

**00:53:10** So they're built on actual examples

**00:53:12** that the two of us put together,

**00:53:14** just as the kinds of things you can use the journal for.

**00:53:17** It's super flexible.

**00:53:18** That's why the boxes don't have any labels.

**00:53:20** I feel, not to congratulate ourselves, Mike,

**00:53:24** but I do think we hit a really sweet spot

**00:53:27** of just enough structure on the pages

**00:53:30** that you can make it work for you

**00:53:33** in the way that you want it to.

**00:53:35** So with the theme system journal,

**00:53:38** you spend time reflecting on your day

**00:53:40** while writing on the journal pages.

**00:53:42** Then you keep track of some key points

**00:53:43** that you wanna hit every day in the daily pages.

**00:53:45** This is what we were talking about earlier on

**00:53:48** that we have these, basically they look like checklists

**00:53:50** and you can mark off if you've completed them.

**00:53:52** Maybe you can color them in like this,

**00:53:54** you can shade them in for if you've completed it

**00:53:56** or half completed it during the day.

**00:53:59** And we were talking about,

**00:54:00** I use it as a way at the moment of like,

**00:54:02** these are the nine things if I do these every day,

**00:54:05** who I wanna be.

**00:54:06** And Grey uses them as like,

**00:54:08** I have the set of things that I wanna do,

**00:54:09** but I order them in importance.

**00:54:12** And so like, this is the kind of stuff

**00:54:13** we were talking about earlier.

**00:54:14** You can track these two things.

**00:54:15** You can write about how you're feeling

**00:54:17** and have something quantitative

**00:54:19** that you can tick off or mark off every day.

**00:54:22** The theme system journal is made of quality materials.

**00:54:24** It took us years of work to get just right.

**00:54:27** And we use them constantly as do at this point,

**00:54:31** thousands upon thousands of other cortexes.

**00:54:33** So you will be in a very good company if you pick one up.

**00:54:36** One of my favorite things is whenever I show someone

**00:54:38** the theme system journal happens every time.

**00:54:40** I hand them the journal.

**00:54:42** First thing they say,

**00:54:43** ooh, feels so nice.

**00:54:46** Like, yes, that's the result of years of work.

**00:54:49** It's funny how that happens really,

**00:54:51** but it really, look, the whole thing is made to,

**00:54:54** I think a very high specification of standard that I set.

**00:54:57** You know, it is, it opens flat

**00:54:59** because it has a semi, like it's like a kind of soft

**00:55:01** hardcover, it has some structure,

**00:55:03** but it opens flat and it's flexible, which I like.

**00:55:06** The paper's really good

**00:55:07** and it works with a whole variety of pens.

**00:55:10** I tried to basically everything that I own

**00:55:12** and I'm really happy with the results.

**00:55:14** So you can buy yours today,

**00:55:16** go to cortexmerch.com and you can pick one up.

**00:55:19** You can buy one or you can subscribe

**00:55:21** and get one every quarter,

**00:55:22** or you can read more about it and see more examples

**00:55:25** of how it works at themesystem.com.

**00:55:27** As we stand right now,

**00:55:29** we have more in stock than we've ever had

**00:55:32** at this time of the year,

**00:55:34** but every single time we've sold out.

**00:55:37** So who knows, right?

**00:55:40** You know, we have more being made right now,

**00:55:43** but we never know what's gonna happen.

**00:55:47** So if you think you might want one of these,

**00:55:49** or if you think there's somebody in your life

**00:55:51** that you might wanna pick one up for the holidays,

**00:55:53** cortexmerch.com.

**00:55:55** And if you like setting a theme for your upcoming year,

**00:55:57** you should have one of these.

**00:55:59** Yes, so we really tried to make it

**00:56:01** so that everyone who wants to get a journal this year

**00:56:04** can get a journal this year.

**00:56:06** But again, just like I said last time,

**00:56:09** I'm going to reemphasize,

**00:56:11** if you're listening to my voice right now

**00:56:13** and you think, oh, I'd like to get a journal for myself,

**00:56:18** or you think, oh, I know someone

**00:56:19** this would make a great stocking stuffer for,

**00:56:22** order it right now,

**00:56:24** because I'm going to promo it again on my YouTube channel.

**00:56:28** So if you're listening to the Cortex podcast,

**00:56:31** you have the heads up before like a bigger rush.

**00:56:35** So go to cortexmerch.com right now

**00:56:39** and get your journal if you want to make sure

**00:56:42** that you have one for the new year.

**00:56:45** Before we get to the themes proper, Mike,

**00:56:49** I have a bit of a interregnum theme topic here,

**00:56:53** just to discuss.

**00:56:54** Okay.

**00:56:55** For the last two years,

**00:56:59** I've had a kind of secret business theme

**00:57:03** that I've been working on.

**00:57:05** Secret theme.

**00:57:07** Yeah, it's a secret theme.

**00:57:09** We talk about our themes for ourselves

**00:57:11** and I've just had this secret business theme,

**00:57:13** which is really related to the YouTube channel

**00:57:15** over the past two years.

**00:57:16** And I thought, well,

**00:57:18** this might as well be a place to review it.

**00:57:20** I have never really talked about it,

**00:57:21** partly because I just didn't know

**00:57:23** if it was going to work at all.

**00:57:24** My business theme for the YouTube channel

**00:57:27** that I started really just after I did

**00:57:30** my very first major Patreon push,

**00:57:33** where I said like,

**00:57:34** oh, I'm not doing sponsorships on the channel now

**00:57:36** and I'm just going to be patron and member supported.

**00:57:39** That kicked off a theme where what I wanted to try to do

**00:57:44** on the YouTube channel was to decrease the average time

**00:57:50** between real video uploads.

**00:57:53** Now I was trying to be very clear with myself.

**00:57:55** I'm like, I'm not setting deadlines here

**00:58:00** because I hate deadlines.

**00:58:01** Did you say that looking in the mirror?

**00:58:03** Yes.

**00:58:05** Listen, listen.

**00:58:06** Hey you.

**00:58:07** You're not going to give yourself a deadline

**00:58:08** because you know what you hate more than anything?

**00:58:11** Deadlines.

**00:58:12** You know what makes you not want to work?

**00:58:14** Deadlines.

**00:58:15** So don't do that.

**00:58:16** Instead, what we're going to do

**00:58:18** is a two year running average.

**00:58:21** So if you're going to track anything,

**00:58:23** you're going to make yourself a little spreadsheet,

**00:58:24** which is exactly what I did.

**00:58:26** And I started every video upload

**00:58:29** tracking a two year running average

**00:58:31** of what was the average time between videos.

**00:58:36** And here we are two years later

**00:58:39** and no one in the world has noticed,

**00:58:43** but I was very pleased

**00:58:45** because when I started the average was over 50 days

**00:58:49** between what I considered to be like real videos.

**00:58:53** And I finally hit the target

**00:58:56** that I wanted to see if I could hit two years later

**00:58:59** with the upload of the Tiffany video,

**00:59:01** which was to get that two year running average

**00:59:05** under 30 days between something that I considered

**00:59:08** to be like a real video.

**00:59:09** Look at you.

**00:59:10** That's a big difference.

**00:59:12** Yeah.

**00:59:13** Again, I think because I operate

**00:59:15** on basically geological timescales for a YouTube channel,

**00:59:20** no one noticed what was to me like a tectonic difference

**00:59:23** in sort of working pressure,

**00:59:25** but I was very pleased to have actually hit this.

**00:59:29** I think this is also a case where it's like

**00:59:31** the stars aligned in various ways

**00:59:32** to make it a little bit easier for me to work

**00:59:34** over these previous two years

**00:59:36** than the two years prior to that.

**00:59:38** But I mentioned all of this

**00:59:40** because the goal of it was never like,

**00:59:43** oh, this is a thing that I want to maintain.

**00:59:46** I want to see if I'm able to do this

**00:59:48** over a long period of time.

**00:59:49** And I'm mentioning it now because in some ways

**00:59:53** it's a little bit of a prelude to where I am

**00:59:56** with the 2022 theme because I think I mentioned it a bunch.

**01:00:03** I can't remember if it was last episode

**01:00:05** or the previous episode,

**01:00:06** but I kept using this phrase like tapped out

**01:00:10** that after this year I felt really tapped out.

**01:00:15** I kind of want to introduce this formally as an idea,

**01:00:18** which is it's separate from the concept of being burned out.

**01:00:24** I feel like burned out has a really precise meaning

**01:00:28** of you've overworked and you're resenting what you're doing

**01:00:34** and you just feel totally used up in a really negative way.

**01:00:40** And that's not the way I feel at all,

**01:00:44** but I do feel like I got myself into a position

**01:00:47** of having really focused on the YouTube channel

**01:00:51** that I was a bit tapped out after the last main upload.

**01:00:57** And the difference there is I feel like I've never liked

**01:01:02** the YouTube channel more than I currently do.

**01:01:04** Like I really wanted to work on it,

**01:01:07** but I just, I made a decision not to do any work

**01:01:10** when I was visiting with my family.

**01:01:12** And I thought, oh, when I come back to the UK,

**01:01:17** then I will get right back into things.

**01:01:20** But spoiler, I did not.

**01:01:22** Like when I returned, I just still for a little while

**01:01:27** found myself completely incapable of getting back to work.

**01:01:32** I think it wasn't helped because when I returned,

**01:01:34** I went straight into a conference,

**01:01:37** which was the first time I had socialized with anyone

**01:01:39** in like two years.

**01:01:40** And then I suddenly met like 120 people

**01:01:43** and was really exhausted by that,

**01:01:45** especially basically stepping right off a plane.

**01:01:47** But nonetheless, I felt really just tapped out.

**01:01:51** And I've only just in the last two weeks

**01:01:54** really started to get back into things because it's like,

**01:01:58** OMG, the end of the year is coming right up.

**01:02:01** And like, I need to get a video out before that is over.

**01:02:04** But it's left me in this funny place

**01:02:09** where I have now without a doubt,

**01:02:13** had the biggest continuous break in my working life,

**01:02:20** since summers in high school, I think.

**01:02:23** Like that's probably the biggest comparison there.

**01:02:26** So I find myself like entering 2022,

**01:02:32** having finished off this, but I think was good,

**01:02:35** but as a kind of strange interregnum.

**01:02:39** And it just makes me think like quite unintentionally,

**01:02:44** YouTube has just in the entertainment world,

**01:02:48** ended up being like this weird 10, 12 year long experiment

**01:02:52** in constant production without seasons.

**01:02:59** Like when you think about people who work

**01:03:02** in the real entertainment industry,

**01:03:04** TV shows operate in seasons, right?

**01:03:07** Movies and other projects are created in a big burst.

**01:03:11** And then there's often a break.

**01:03:13** And I think kind of no one noticed

**01:03:17** or it just sort of slowly crept up that YouTube

**01:03:21** has become this huge booming part

**01:03:23** of the entertainment industry.

**01:03:26** But there is no season break ever

**01:03:30** just because of the way that it's structured.

**01:03:32** And I think that that's been good for content production,

**01:03:38** but maybe bad for people.

**01:03:40** So I don't know, I don't have any solid thoughts

**01:03:45** around that right now, but it's just been on my mind

**01:03:48** that like maybe there should be dedicated downtime

**01:03:52** instead of like an accidental downtime

**01:03:55** where it's like, oh boy, you've really worked a bunch

**01:03:58** and now you're tapped out

**01:03:59** and you're sort of accidentally taking downtime

**01:04:02** over a long period of time.

**01:04:03** But I don't know, it's just something that's been on my mind

**01:04:06** and I feel like I'm just entering what's supposed

**01:04:10** to be new theme season in this weird in betweeny state.

**01:04:15** Well, I'm pleased you hit the little theme

**01:04:18** that you have for yourself of reducing that timeframe.

**01:04:22** I'm also pleased that you realize that you can do it

**01:04:26** but you don't need to do it.

**01:04:28** I think that that's a good thing.

**01:04:29** You know you have this.

**01:04:31** So if for any reason you feel like you must

**01:04:34** or need to change for a period of time, you can,

**01:04:37** but also knowing that it's not imperative for you to do so

**01:04:42** and that you haven't built your business in such a way

**01:04:44** that it requires the timeframe to decrease.

**01:04:49** Because I know a lot of people in YouTube, right?

**01:04:51** You're talking about that.

**01:04:52** They build large teams around them

**01:04:54** and they have whole machines that run

**01:04:56** that require the feeding of the beast.

**01:04:59** But your business isn't made that way.

**01:05:02** But it's good to know that if you ever need to turn up

**01:05:05** the dial, you can, but also remaining core to yourself

**01:05:09** that that's not who you always want to be.

**01:05:11** I think that that's two valuable things

**01:05:13** that you've taken away from that.

**01:05:15** Yeah, yeah.

**01:05:16** And I think like the YouTube channel was under attentioned

**01:05:20** in some ways.

**01:05:21** And I mean, it also like, it just has been interesting

**01:05:25** that while I think basically none of my viewers

**01:05:27** have noticed at all, it is the case that it feels

**01:05:30** like the YouTube system has noticed.

**01:05:32** And so like the numbers for the channel have been great

**01:05:35** over the last two years with even just like this,

**01:05:37** not major, but just slight shift in the frequency.

**01:05:42** I think part of that is just simply also you like

**01:05:45** more uploads mean they're sort of more lottery tickets

**01:05:47** that one of them does really well, but yeah.

**01:05:50** So anyway, I don't know.

**01:05:51** I felt a little bit like, ooh,

**01:05:52** I had this secret business theme that I was working on

**01:05:54** like tee hee hee updating my spreadsheet.

**01:05:56** And I just never told anybody about it.

**01:05:58** And it was always like, ooh boy, look at that.

**01:05:59** The number is slightly going down month by month

**01:06:02** over two years.

**01:06:03** And when I did actually see like, oh wow,

**01:06:06** the two year running average hit 28 days

**01:06:09** with the Tiffany video for the videos that I count as real.

**01:06:12** I was like, wow, that's amazing.

**01:06:15** Like I'm really happy about that.

**01:06:16** So I did just want to mention it

**01:06:18** in this little interregnum section.

**01:08:10** A thanks to LinkedIn jobs

**01:08:11** for their support of this show and Relay FM.

**01:08:15** So what's the real theme then?

**01:08:16** Okay, 2022 theme.

**01:08:21** I think this is going to be my most nebulous theme ever.

**01:08:28** So the name is New Dawn.

**01:08:31** Ooh.

**01:08:32** Ooh, it's an interesting name.

**01:08:35** Yes, but of course I have secret brackets in there

**01:08:37** because I know that's always what you like.

**01:08:39** So New Dawn has been my like short working title.

**01:08:42** That's the name for the note in Obsidian.

**01:08:46** But the full title for me is New Decades Dawn brackets again.

**01:08:52** Wait, the year of New Decades Dawn again.

**01:08:58** What is that?

**01:09:00** What is that?

**01:09:02** No, it's new open parentheses, decades,

**01:09:06** close parentheses, dawn, square brackets,

**01:09:09** again, close square brackets.

**01:09:11** That's the way I have it written in my text document.

**01:09:13** The year of new bracket decades, Dawn bracket again.

**01:09:20** Yeah, I think that's very clear, right?

**01:09:22** No, I'm there now.

**01:09:24** Here, I can message it to you

**01:09:25** so you see how it's properly formatted.

**01:09:27** I would like that.

**01:09:28** Although you can ignore the backslashes

**01:09:30** because that's necessary formatting for Obsidian

**01:09:32** to say that it's not an actual link to somewhere else.

**01:09:34** So there you go, very clear.

**01:09:35** That's just what you need.

**01:09:39** Yeah, so I don't,

**01:09:43** I'm gonna be straight up about it.

**01:09:44** So this is one of these times where I feel like

**01:09:47** I have come to the episode about the yearly theme

**01:09:51** and I do not have clearly solidified ideas.

**01:09:55** I think part of that is just the year has felt like

**01:09:58** it's gone incredibly fast.

**01:10:00** And I think part of that is this funny interregnum period

**01:10:06** where I'm just coming off a huge working break.

**01:10:09** And like we talked about last time in State of the Apps,

**01:10:12** there's a lot of stuff where it just feels like,

**01:10:14** oh man, I've been really out of practice

**01:10:18** with a lot of what I consider to be my normal life.

**01:10:23** I haven't really been using my to-do managers.

**01:10:26** I haven't really been tracking time.

**01:10:28** I haven't been tracking projects in various ways.

**01:10:31** Just feels like there's been this real big gap.

**01:10:34** But I also think that that's kind of an opportunity.

**01:10:39** And the thing that happened this year

**01:10:43** that I feel like I've only just really begun to process

**01:10:48** is realizing that I really have been on YouTube for 10 years.

**01:10:55** And so part of what my idea for this theme is,

**01:11:00** what does it really mean to think about

**01:11:04** the next 10 years of my career?

**01:11:09** Now, it's a funny thing to say

**01:11:11** because I'm in the entertainment industry.

**01:11:14** And so careers are very uncertain.

**01:11:18** On a knife's edge at all times.

**01:11:20** Yes, it really is true.

**01:11:22** Part of that is quite seriously thinking about,

**01:11:26** okay, what are the bounds of this career?

**01:11:30** And again, I feel really fortunate

**01:11:33** that I have found work that is well-suited to me

**01:11:39** to my personality and my temperament

**01:11:42** and the kinds of things that interest me.

**01:11:44** And I would love to keep doing this,

**01:11:48** but I was trying to be very serious about it.

**01:11:50** I was like, okay, the projections that I've kind of made

**01:11:54** are 20 more years of doing this

**01:11:57** is my optimistic great outcome.

**01:12:00** 10 years is like the median prediction.

**01:12:03** And five years, I feel like,

**01:12:06** is the very pessimistic prediction of,

**01:12:09** oh no, something's gone wrong.

**01:12:11** TikTokers or GPT-5 have taken over the world.

**01:12:16** And like your career is just totally irrelevant.

**01:12:18** Who knows?

**01:12:19** But I really like what I do.

**01:12:22** And I just, I find myself thinking about it

**01:12:27** in these two ways that like,

**01:12:31** on one hand, I feel like I have a really solid base.

**01:12:35** Like I've been lucky to build up this audience over time.

**01:12:40** And on the other hand, I feel like,

**01:12:42** oh, if you're really serious about trying to think

**01:12:47** about a 10 year horizon for what you wanna do,

**01:12:50** you also can't take any of that for granted.

**01:12:54** There's no guarantee that it continues to last.

**01:12:57** And so that also means you have to be really serious

**01:13:01** about what does it mean if you're deciding here

**01:13:06** that you really wanna do this for another decade.

**01:13:10** In the same way that when I started a decade ago,

**01:13:14** also after a big break, I had to be really serious

**01:13:19** about what does this mean that this is my career now?

**01:13:23** Like what do I have to do in order to make this work?

**01:13:26** And so that's why I have this idea,

**01:13:29** like new decades dawn again,

**01:13:32** is it really feels like this is a mirror time

**01:13:36** to when I started 10 years ago.

**01:13:40** It's after a big break.

**01:13:42** I'm obviously in a much better position now,

**01:13:47** but I also think I need to take it very seriously

**01:13:51** because I don't know, in some ways,

**01:13:55** over time, it's just kind of felt very natural

**01:14:03** that like, oh, YouTube is what I do.

**01:14:06** And in the way that you forget your past selves,

**01:14:09** it starts to feel like, oh, this is the thing

**01:14:12** that I've just always done, right?

**01:14:14** This is quite natural.

**01:14:16** I've always done this and it'll just always be here.

**01:14:20** It was like, but no, no, no, no.

**01:14:21** This is a good time to wake up

**01:14:24** and seriously think about it again.

**01:14:26** And I wish I had more solid thoughts around this theme,

**01:14:33** but I actually feel like this is really not something

**01:14:39** to rush, which is why I mean that thinking

**01:14:43** about this theme kind of is the theme for the year.

**01:14:49** Think about the next long-term phase of your career.

**01:14:55** And I also just found myself thinking about a lot of things

**01:15:00** on a much more multi-year timeline now.

**01:15:04** It's very funny that for you, one of your things is,

**01:15:08** oh, much less travel, right?

**01:15:10** But for me, the decision has been much more travel.

**01:15:13** Like my wife and I have not traveled very much at all

**01:15:18** in the time that we have lived here.

**01:15:20** And so we've set a real horizon on like, okay,

**01:15:25** we need to consciously over the next several years,

**01:15:29** travel more.

**01:15:31** And we were also thinking about, do we move out of London?

**01:15:37** Where do we want to spend the next big chunk of time?

**01:15:42** And we have actually decided that we don't wanna move

**01:15:46** right now, but we've said alike,

**01:15:50** we will reevaluate this question in two years.

**01:15:55** Like we'll come back to this and then see like,

**01:15:57** is moving something that we want to do or is it not?

**01:16:02** But this is like a lot of the things that's been going on

**01:16:05** for me is just thinking about things

**01:16:07** on multiple year timelines in a way

**01:16:11** that I just haven't before.

**01:16:14** On one hand, I have this feeling like

**01:16:17** I'm starting from a very solid base.

**01:16:21** I have this career.

**01:16:22** I also have on the business side,

**01:16:24** I've mentioned over the years of like how much of a pain

**01:16:27** in the butt it is to try to like set up business processes

**01:16:30** in the background and like get all the paperwork sorted.

**01:16:33** And this year has really proven

**01:16:37** that we got all the systems right

**01:16:40** and the way that they're supposed to be.

**01:16:42** No nation baby.

**01:16:44** I know this is going to sound crazy

**01:16:45** that it's a multi-year process to get paperwork in order,

**01:16:48** but I will again say, if anyone listening

**01:16:51** to the sound of my voice is an American living abroad

**01:16:55** and you think there is any chance at all

**01:16:58** that you will be self-employed in the future,

**01:17:01** do not ever do that while you are tax resident

**01:17:05** outside of the United States.

**01:17:07** It will be a living nightmare for you for multiple years.

**01:17:13** That's very actionable advice.

**01:17:16** That is the most actionable advice I can ever give.

**01:17:19** Listen, American expats, you will go on the internet

**01:17:22** and you will read from people, oh, there's no problem.

**01:17:25** There's tax treaties between.

**01:17:27** Don't listen to any of those people.

**01:17:29** They don't know what they're talking about.

**01:17:32** They're in situations where they're just employed

**01:17:34** by someone who was handling it all.

**01:17:36** The moment you step outside of the normal system,

**01:17:39** it is a total nightmare for you.

**01:17:41** But anyway, all of this is to say like last year,

**01:17:43** we thought that we had like finally gotten

**01:17:46** an entire system in place so that everything

**01:17:48** just works really nicely.

**01:17:50** And I just had my end of year meeting with my assistant

**01:17:53** and it's like, great, everything did work perfectly.

**01:17:57** Like this long-term background nightmare

**01:18:00** is truly and finally over.

**01:18:03** It's all set up.

**01:18:04** All of the bits are working.

**01:18:06** Everything with gray industries,

**01:18:08** everything with Cortex brand, it's all very complicated,

**01:18:10** but it's working and it's fantastic.

**01:18:12** And it really feels like great.

**01:18:14** I have put behind me one of the biggest problems

**01:18:20** that I had had, which always kind of made

**01:18:23** the whole YouTube business feel a bit improvised.

**01:18:27** Like who knows what we're doing, you know,

**01:18:29** but now it's all set.

**01:18:31** One of the other things that's been on my mind

**01:18:34** is again, thinking of this as a mirror time

**01:18:37** to when I first started is reevaluating my YouTube channel

**01:18:45** and my YouTube business in the face of what YouTube

**01:18:50** and the internet currently are,

**01:18:54** not what I remember them as being slash wish them to be.

**01:19:01** And so part of this is I've been real mopey

**01:19:05** over the last couple of years about changes

**01:19:09** with the way the algorithm works and changes to thumbnails

**01:19:13** and like a bunch of stuff about like,

**01:19:15** boo-hoo, I wish YouTube was different.

**01:19:18** And I really have this strong feeling of,

**01:19:22** suck it up, dude, like that is over.

**01:19:24** And if you're serious about trying to do this

**01:19:28** for another decade, you've just got to put that aside

**01:19:31** and think about like the reality of maintaining a career

**01:19:35** in the face of intense global competition

**01:19:41** in an established industry.

**01:19:42** And you know what, when you think about that

**01:19:46** in a real serious way, I think it becomes easier.

**01:19:49** I think I had just let myself get mopey about it

**01:19:53** slowly over time in a way that I hadn't like

**01:19:58** called myself out over.

**01:20:01** This is what I mean by like being serious about it again,

**01:20:04** kind of waking up from, oh, YouTube is just what I always do.

**01:20:09** And it's like, no, no, this is a thing

**01:20:11** that you have to work for.

**01:20:12** And so that's part of what I'm thinking about.

**01:20:15** This feels like a very like, I kind of think of it

**01:20:18** as a phrase, but like you're slapping yourself

**01:20:20** in the face kind of thing.

**01:20:22** Wake up.

**01:20:23** Yeah, a little bit.

**01:20:23** It is sort of funny, like I actually think

**01:20:25** really pushing the goal of trying to increase

**01:20:29** the frequency between videos.

**01:20:31** While it's not something that I'm trying to maintain

**01:20:34** going forward, I think like that sort of started

**01:20:37** directing my thinking towards this.

**01:20:39** Yeah, I can draw a line between the two things

**01:20:41** that you've been talking about, because one of the things

**01:20:44** that you said is that when you decreased the time period,

**01:20:48** you saw that YouTube was favoring you again.

**01:20:52** And then when you think about like, all right,

**01:20:55** I should actually be taking this seriously

**01:20:57** and doing what a YouTuber should do,

**01:21:00** that's the line where like really, you can as a YouTuber

**01:21:04** say, as we do many times, we like bemoan the platform

**01:21:07** or what they do, it's like, I just wanna make the videos

**01:21:10** I wanna make, and you can do that, and you have done that

**01:21:12** and it's great, but if you decide, no, I wanna participate

**01:21:16** in this thing that I'm a part of, it is all about

**01:21:20** doing the things that the system wants you to do

**01:21:23** to serve the videos in the way that they want.

**01:21:25** That's what all big YouTubers do, right?

**01:21:27** They're like, we focus on this, we focus on this,

**01:21:30** and you've been doing more of that,

**01:21:32** and you're getting the results.

**01:21:33** So you don't have to go all in and make like two uploads

**01:21:37** a week and you got your shit, but there are things

**01:21:39** that you can do to be more serious about being a part

**01:21:44** of the platform, and we spoke about like titles

**01:21:47** and thumbnails, like that's an important part,

**01:21:49** and the frequency, the algorithm seems to like it.

**01:21:52** So like, I can draw a line between those two things of like,

**01:21:56** oh, when I did this thing, I saw a benefit,

**01:21:58** I'm actually now gonna try and be more serious

**01:22:01** about how I approached this.

**01:22:03** I think it's interesting.

**01:22:04** I would say that there are many ways in which I was

**01:22:08** actively bucking the system out of like...

**01:22:12** Kind of spite, it's like kind of a spite thing.

**01:22:14** I get it, I get it.

**01:22:15** It's like, I was the same, you changed,

**01:22:17** and I don't like it.

**01:22:18** Yes, yes, that's exactly right.

**01:22:22** Yeah, I used to be able to depend on my subscribers

**01:22:24** to always see my videos, and now you've changed.

**01:22:27** Well, I'm still just gonna call my video Exploring T-Coy,

**01:22:31** and I'll just, it's like, no, that's a terrible title, dude.

**01:22:34** That's awful.

**01:22:35** That last video, calling it Someone Dead Ruined My Life

**01:22:38** Again, there's no way that didn't have a huge impact

**01:22:41** on the number of people actually watching it, right?

**01:22:44** And it's a behind the scenes video

**01:22:46** that got more views than the video.

**01:22:47** Yeah, and I think my, I can't remember exactly what it was,

**01:22:50** but the original title I wanted to give it

**01:22:52** was something like The Poem Project, right?

**01:22:55** Which is like, oh, God.

**01:22:56** Dude.

**01:22:57** Let me click it.

**01:23:01** Read me a poem, Gray.

**01:23:02** Yeah, exactly.

**01:23:03** It's like, that's, I almost couldn't engineer

**01:23:05** like a worse title, right?

**01:23:07** This is terrible.

**01:23:08** And one of the things that has helped draw this

**01:23:13** to my attention is a new business theme,

**01:23:17** which I am going to mention here,

**01:23:19** because I think part of what happened in the past is,

**01:23:23** subscribers used to really matter on YouTube,

**01:23:25** and then they made a bunch of changes,

**01:23:27** and subscribers don't matter.

**01:23:29** And that's fine.

**01:23:30** And I was always like, I came to the conclusion,

**01:23:32** like subscribers don't matter.

**01:23:34** And I think in some part of my brain,

**01:23:36** I kind of went, so nothing matters,

**01:23:38** was the rest of that sentence every time I was saying like,

**01:23:41** oh, subscribers don't matter on YouTube anymore.

**01:23:44** I think there was a silent, so nothing matters,

**01:23:47** but I realized, oh, I actually can have a target,

**01:23:53** which is my next business theme, which is a multi,

**01:23:57** let me just be very clear,

**01:23:58** is a multi multi-year target is called a billion or bust.

**01:24:04** Okay.

**01:24:07** I would like as a career goal to get to a billion views

**01:24:12** on the channel.

**01:24:13** My lifetime views over 10 years

**01:24:16** is just about 700 million views,

**01:24:19** and extrapolating it out, it's like,

**01:24:24** okay, I think I'm on track for hitting that

**01:24:26** in something like five years.

**01:24:29** Can I bring that down to four years?

**01:24:31** That's cool. That would be great.

**01:24:33** Yeah. Three years,

**01:24:36** you know, that'd be fast, but you know what?

**01:24:38** It's an actual target, and it actually feels really,

**01:24:43** even though I don't like goals,

**01:24:46** and even then I still use the word like target,

**01:24:49** I prefer the word target, but this really is a goal,

**01:24:52** and it's nice to have a career goal

**01:24:56** that's an actually measurable thing.

**01:24:58** No, I think it's good,

**01:24:58** because you can have this thing up there

**01:25:01** of like a thing you want to achieve,

**01:25:03** and then your theme this year is the beginning

**01:25:06** of trying to get to what that eventual goal would be,

**01:25:09** that target, right?

**01:25:11** The theme of, I can't even remember the name,

**01:25:13** new decades dawn, but now I understand it.

**01:25:16** I do actually understand it now of like,

**01:25:18** this is me recommitting,

**01:25:22** and in that recommitment,

**01:25:24** it's the beginning steps towards

**01:25:27** achieving this big business target of a billion,

**01:25:31** because if you just make videos for the next 35 years,

**01:25:36** you'll probably get there,

**01:25:38** but wouldn't it be great to do it,

**01:25:39** as you say, in full years?

**01:25:40** Yeah, and it's more that it feels nice and motivating

**01:25:46** to have a meaningful number to track.

**01:25:49** Like the subscriber number is not meaningful on YouTube,

**01:25:53** it is a vanity number,

**01:25:55** but somehow it never dawned on me like,

**01:25:57** oh, the total views on the channel is a meaningful number,

**01:26:02** and it would just be nice

**01:26:04** when I have to describe like,

**01:26:08** what I do in a sentence to be able to say like,

**01:26:11** oh, I run a YouTube channel that has a billion views.

**01:26:14** Great, like I think that's a nice one sentence pitch.

**01:26:17** I will say though, Gray,

**01:26:18** saying I have a YouTube channel

**01:26:20** that has over 700 million views is still also really good.

**01:26:24** I'm not saying it's bad,

**01:26:25** I'm just saying a billion is a great number.

**01:26:27** Bigger numbers, always good, right?

**01:26:30** Big numbers, you're always looking for bigger numbers,

**01:26:32** but yeah, I get your point.

**01:26:34** It's also faster to say billion rather than 700 million.

**01:26:38** Exactly, and I think there's some way in which

**01:26:40** when you're saying the number with more digits,

**01:26:42** it sounds like you're being much more

**01:26:43** of a try hard sort of person.

**01:26:45** Like it just sounds better to say billion.

**01:26:47** Over 744, right?

**01:26:49** Like, oh, so 745 is that what you're saying?

**01:26:52** Yes, exactly.

**01:26:54** This is also a clear example of what do I mean by,

**01:26:58** I find myself thinking about multi-year goals,

**01:27:02** and this is totally a multi-year goal.

**01:27:06** I'm very happy to have it.

**01:27:08** I'll also just say there's another sub part of this for me,

**01:27:13** which is the again has a double meaning here,

**01:27:15** which is the pandemic for me has,

**01:27:21** again, personally, mostly been a huge net positive

**01:27:24** in my life.

**01:27:25** 2020 was without a doubt,

**01:27:28** one of the best years of my adult life.

**01:27:31** And 2021, while I would describe it as a highly variant year,

**01:27:37** it's also not a year I would want to do any differently.

**01:27:40** Highly variant, that's a real phrase to use for 2021.

**01:27:45** I feel the same.

**01:27:46** Whatever, I'm sticking with it.

**01:27:48** It's been a highly variant.

**01:27:48** Yeah, you do go with it, man, it's all yours.

**01:27:51** It's like, should I rephrase it?

**01:27:52** The variance has been quite high,

**01:27:53** but that doesn't make any difference.

**01:27:54** It's still the same.

**01:27:56** But the one thing that I really feel like I resent

**01:27:59** the pandemic for is it took away what was my goal

**01:28:05** at the start of two years ago,

**01:28:07** which was that I wanted to do more gray goes outside.

**01:28:12** And I was like, I was gearing up for,

**01:28:15** you know what I want to do?

**01:28:16** More stuff in the real world.

**01:28:18** I want to go to places.

**01:28:20** I want to try to see stuff.

**01:28:21** And like, I lost that.

**01:28:23** I really did.

**01:28:24** It was just terrible timing.

**01:28:26** And so the again, part of it is I want to start this up

**01:28:31** again, it's a funny thing to do,

**01:28:34** but it's also fits within the multi-year timeline here

**01:28:39** because I feel like I'm trying to start up a sort of career

**01:28:44** within a career on the YouTube channel.

**01:28:48** I've tried lots of times filming a bunch of stuff

**01:28:52** in the real world.

**01:28:53** The vast majority of it has not worked out

**01:28:56** and has never appeared on the channel.

**01:28:58** Some of the things that I've done have gone up there,

**01:29:00** but they've all been sort of weird and random.

**01:29:03** And this also feels like I either want to solve this

**01:29:10** or I want to put this to bed and be like, you know what?

**01:29:13** This isn't a good use of your time.

**01:29:15** Don't try to do the real life stuff.

**01:29:17** This is also another one where I'm kind of giving myself

**01:29:22** two years to really make a decision about

**01:29:26** is this a good use of my time?

**01:29:29** Does this make sense to do?

**01:29:31** And maybe at the end of the two years I discover,

**01:29:36** you know what?

**01:29:36** Going places is good for me personally

**01:29:38** and I shouldn't waste my time filming

**01:29:41** or maybe two years from now I decide,

**01:29:44** oh, this is actually like a great use of my time.

**01:29:46** But right now I just don't know,

**01:29:49** but that was the thing that I really wanted to do

**01:29:52** at the start of the pandemic

**01:29:54** and it was taken away from me, that opportunity.

**01:29:57** So I'm booting that one up again.

**01:30:01** I'm pleased because I love those videos.

**01:30:02** I always enjoy the videos where there's like that mix

**01:30:05** and where you're outside doing stuff.

**01:30:07** So I look forward to more of it.

**01:30:09** I know it's hard and I know it's like a different set

**01:30:11** of skills and they're tricky to make

**01:30:14** and they're tricky to get right,

**01:30:15** but I always enjoy them when you do them.

**01:30:17** Yeah, I mean, we can talk about this another time,

**01:30:18** but I'm very-

**01:30:20** I don't know what these videos are yet.

**01:30:23** Like I love the sharks video,

**01:30:24** but I feel like that isn't even really

**01:30:26** a gray goes outside video.

**01:30:27** That's just its own weird thing.

**01:30:29** You've seen a video that I'm working on now,

**01:30:31** which is also very stylistically different

**01:30:34** and is its own weird thing.

**01:30:35** I don't know, but I wanna solve this one way or another

**01:30:42** and possibly solving it is deciding

**01:30:44** like it just doesn't make sense.

**01:30:46** I don't know, but this is a multi-year project

**01:30:50** that I wanna really get working on.

**01:30:51** And yeah, so that's the again part.

**01:30:55** The again part.

**01:30:56** Yeah, that's the again part.

**01:30:57** Pretty big theme. There we go.

**01:30:58** Pretty big theme, this one.

**01:31:00** This reminds me of my last year theme.

**01:31:02** So my advice to you is don't get lost in it.

**01:31:07** Yeah, I think we may need to discuss that.

**01:31:10** Yeah, cause I feel like it is without a doubt

**01:31:13** my most vague and unclear, but also feels really important.

**01:31:18** So I'm very happy to revisit your experiences with this.

**01:31:23** And yeah, we can talk about this some more.

**01:33:12** Tell me about your theme, Mike.

**01:33:13** Okay, I'm gonna start off with the name,

**01:33:15** which is the year of structure.

**01:33:18** I was tempting to go gray on this

**01:33:20** and I have bracket and unstructured,

**01:33:24** but I decided not to do that.

**01:33:26** That doesn't make any sense.

**01:33:27** Because I don't like the brackets.

**01:33:28** I always think of, what is it?

**01:33:30** Year of less comma me.

**01:33:32** That's the one that I always think of.

**01:33:34** I like to just have one word.

**01:33:36** And I really struggled with the word,

**01:33:37** but I think you'll see why I got to it.

**01:33:40** My kind of description for the theme is that

**01:33:44** I feel like I need a better structure in place

**01:33:47** to handle the various responsibilities

**01:33:49** that I have in my life.

**01:33:51** And also carving out and allowing

**01:33:53** for more unstructured time.

**01:33:56** I feel like I have a,

**01:33:58** I think pretty desperate need at this point

**01:34:00** to have more space in my life

**01:34:03** while also balancing the things that I want

**01:34:05** and need to be working on.

**01:34:07** Over the last couple of years,

**01:34:09** I feel like I have lost some of the grip

**01:34:12** on my responsibilities.

**01:34:14** Like they just continue to stretch in all directions.

**01:34:18** And I feel like at this point,

**01:34:20** I have way too many disparate things going on.

**01:34:23** And I feel like I need to do some work

**01:34:26** to get everything back in order,

**01:34:28** pair some things down and find space in my schedule

**01:34:32** so I can better serve all of the things

**01:34:34** that are the most important.

**01:34:36** So like I wanna have this unstructured time

**01:34:38** to allow me to come up with new things

**01:34:41** that are related to the most important things that I'm doing.

**01:34:44** And I feel like I need to spend a bit more time

**01:34:47** looking at the wider picture of all of this

**01:34:49** rather than focusing on small aspects,

**01:34:51** which is what I've tried to do in the past.

**01:34:53** Like fix this small thing, reduce this responsibility

**01:34:56** and surely it will make space.

**01:34:57** When I actually think I need to spend time

**01:34:59** looking at the overall wider picture of this,

**01:35:02** one of the traps that I fall into

**01:35:04** when it comes to reducing my time

**01:35:06** is realizing that I wanna do this

**01:35:09** and try to make changes at the end of the year.

**01:35:12** It's a terrible time to do it

**01:35:14** because you have not allowed yourself time

**01:35:18** to set up for the next year.

**01:35:19** So if you decide, hey, I wanna get rid of this project,

**01:35:23** it's too late at that point to do it in November.

**01:35:26** Like I think mentally that's how we think,

**01:35:29** oh, well just because it's before the next year,

**01:35:32** but by November you've already started

**01:35:33** the preparation for the next year.

**01:35:35** Everything's in motion at that point.

**01:35:37** So I am planning on doing the work in 2022

**01:35:42** to enable this for late 2022, 2023 onward.

**01:35:48** So my plan is to work on the structure

**01:35:52** where I can make improvements

**01:35:54** and start the process for making those improvements

**01:35:58** for next year, because if I decide now

**01:36:02** I want the year structure, it's too late for me

**01:36:04** to make all of the changes that I might wanna make for 2022.

**01:36:08** So 2022 is working on what do I do for the future,

**01:36:15** but near term when it comes to making structure.

**01:36:18** Okay, can you give me a specific example

**01:36:20** of what you think you're going to be doing

**01:36:22** in the first half of next year?

**01:36:24** I feel like I'm having a hard time,

**01:36:26** which is terribly unfair of me with my really vague notions,

**01:36:29** but I feel like I'm having a hard time making concrete

**01:36:33** what it is that you're trying to achieve here.

**01:36:37** When you say you want more unstructured time,

**01:36:40** does that mean more time not working?

**01:36:43** Is that what that translates into?

**01:36:45** No, so one of the things that I think will help

**01:36:47** is I can run through some of my outcomes for this,

**01:36:49** for like what I think are my things that I would get.

**01:36:52** So like in the first one is I want more days

**01:36:56** with less to no appointments in my diary,

**01:36:59** less stuff on my calendar, right?

**01:37:02** So these are days where I can be more reactive

**01:37:05** to things that are coming up,

**01:37:07** but also having large chunks of time

**01:37:09** to tackle bigger things, bigger projects.

**01:37:12** Like I wanna sit down and work out the layout

**01:37:16** for a new journal project, right?

**01:37:19** I guess just imagine I have something where I'm like,

**01:37:21** oh, I wanna rethink the new way of looking at things

**01:37:25** from a wider lens, right?

**01:37:26** I can sit down and be like, what would that look like?

**01:37:29** How could we make, like I wanna have that time

**01:37:32** to sit down and like, oh, I've got the afternoon here.

**01:37:36** What do I wanna think about today?

**01:37:39** Like I very rarely have that kind of time.

**01:37:41** Usually it's like, oh, I've only got two hours

**01:37:44** and then I've got three shows.

**01:37:46** Okay, okay, so that's one of the things

**01:37:49** that you're trying to achieve is larger blocks of time

**01:37:54** without interruptions.

**01:37:55** That are just for me to turn my attention

**01:37:58** to whatever it is I wanna turn my attention on

**01:38:01** rather than my calendar telling me

**01:38:03** what my attention is supposed to be on.

**01:38:07** I mean, I can get behind that.

**01:38:08** Your calendar always looks like a nightmare to me

**01:38:09** whenever. It's horrible, yeah.

**01:38:11** So this is like creating the structure for less structure.

**01:38:15** So like I am creating a structure for unstructured time.

**01:38:19** Does this mean that you're going to be trying to

**01:38:22** pile up more shows on recording days

**01:38:25** or are you going to be trying to do actually less

**01:38:28** or delegate more or like what are your thoughts

**01:38:31** on how to actually achieve this?

**01:38:33** Let me tell you at the end of 2022.

**01:38:35** Okay, yes, please don't let me rush you.

**01:38:39** I'm just, I'm-

**01:38:39** Yeah, but this is the point is I don't know yet.

**01:38:43** You don't know, right.

**01:38:44** There might be some things.

**01:38:46** It might not be shows, but things I have to give up.

**01:38:50** Okay, okay, I feel like I'm getting this

**01:38:53** because I, okay, I really liked your point

**01:38:54** and you're totally right that at this point in the year,

**01:38:59** the next year was already sort of locked in.

**01:39:02** I have a funny example that I want to travel more.

**01:39:05** I feel like I haven't really thought about what my next

**01:39:08** year's travel schedule should look like,

**01:39:11** but discovered in my monthly meeting with my assistant

**01:39:15** that next year I am already booked for more days away

**01:39:19** from home than at home without me even noticing.

**01:39:21** And it's like, oh, okay, schedules just get locked in

**01:39:25** without you even noticing.

**01:39:27** And if I wanted to have next year be like

**01:39:30** year of relaxation, tough noogies,

**01:39:33** I would need to next year start planning for the year

**01:39:37** after to be year of relaxation.

**01:39:40** So that's what you're going for here.

**01:39:41** All I know is right now I have the feeling.

**01:39:44** Okay, I get it.

**01:39:45** And I need to do the work on it.

**01:39:47** Right, okay.

**01:39:47** Like I was talking to a friend of mine

**01:39:51** and they were saying like a similar thing,

**01:39:53** like, oh, I have some stuff that I want to reduce,

**01:39:55** but it's too late.

**01:39:57** And I was kind of like, yeah,

**01:39:58** this time of year is terrible for this.

**01:40:01** Like I feel like this every couple of years,

**01:40:03** and I feel like at this time, it's like, well,

**01:40:05** it's too late to make your decisions.

**01:40:09** And as well, I haven't even worked out fully

**01:40:12** what the important areas are.

**01:40:14** And it's also like, basically everyone,

**01:40:19** I feel like I've been in this holding pattern

**01:40:21** for the last year and a half.

**01:40:23** And I have these large areas that I want to make

**01:40:27** forward progress on, and I've stalled on them all.

**01:40:30** And now I want to move all of them at the same time.

**01:40:34** So it's like my home, my studio, family and the business.

**01:40:38** And these things have all had to in some way be held

**01:40:43** and I want to move them all,

**01:40:44** but now I want to move them all at the same time.

**01:40:46** That's a lot.

**01:40:47** If I want to focus on these like family areas

**01:40:51** and like maybe moving to a new home,

**01:40:53** I know I've got to reduce some of my work commitments

**01:40:56** to enable that as a thing.

**01:40:58** So I've got to do this like balancing act

**01:41:02** of these things this year.

**01:41:04** But what I've learned from 2020 and 2021

**01:41:07** is just adding things on top

**01:41:11** is not a great way to do that.

**01:41:13** There has to be a reduction.

**01:41:16** A couple of the other areas that I want to focus on

**01:41:18** when it comes to the year structure.

**01:41:20** So I have my calendar, right?

**01:41:21** Is one, my second is I want to make my to-do list smaller.

**01:41:27** Because I have noticed, I have developed a habit

**01:41:30** of opening to-do list and just staring

**01:41:32** at my upcoming tasks.

**01:41:34** Right.

**01:41:35** I just open and I look,

**01:41:37** and I'm just looking at what I have.

**01:41:39** Looking like a small animal trapped in headlights.

**01:41:42** I think it might be something like that.

**01:41:44** But I just feel like I'm just opening it and looking at it.

**01:41:47** And I'm like scrolling through and see,

**01:41:49** in a way that I don't think is helpful.

**01:41:53** And I feel like I am adding too much stuff.

**01:41:57** It's like I have a thought and I add it.

**01:41:59** I have a thought and I add it.

**01:42:00** And it all goes into my own to-do list.

**01:42:04** And I feel like there's two things

**01:42:05** that I want to handle here.

**01:42:06** I want to have less stuff bouncing around in my brain

**01:42:10** that feel like there's a need for constant things

**01:42:13** to be added to do list.

**01:42:14** And that comes from reducing some responsibilities.

**01:42:18** The other is this idea of relying on other people

**01:42:25** to do things.

**01:42:27** Like I need to start loosening my grip in certain areas

**01:42:32** and like letting work get done

**01:42:34** without me needing to be involved in it.

**01:42:36** Like people that have responsibility,

**01:42:39** allowing them to just handle the responsibility

**01:42:41** and trusting that the work will be done.

**01:42:44** And so there's a couple of things here.

**01:42:46** There's one just like trying to relax

**01:42:48** and like let go a little bit.

**01:42:50** This vacation's actually been pretty good for me

**01:42:52** on that one.

**01:42:53** Where I've realized again that like I work

**01:42:55** with a selection of very talented and competent people.

**01:42:59** I can trust them and they will get the work done.

**01:43:02** I don't need to have a hand on it all, all the time.

**01:43:06** I think I need an assistant again,

**01:43:08** because I don't have one.

**01:43:09** Right, well yes.

**01:43:11** You had one.

**01:43:12** I had one.

**01:43:13** My assistant became the Vice President of Sales

**01:43:15** at Real AFM because that's what she's best at.

**01:43:19** And that's like another thing of like the sales portion

**01:43:23** of the business to be handled by the Vice President of Sales

**01:43:25** and respecting the logical structure in our company.

**01:43:29** Right, that I don't need to have my hand so much on that.

**01:43:32** And that's the thing that we're working on together.

**01:43:34** But I think I also need somebody to help me

**01:43:38** with more basic tasks again.

**01:43:41** And so that goes back to what's one way

**01:43:44** I make my to-do list smaller is that some things go

**01:43:48** into Slack for somebody else to handle.

**01:43:51** Right.

**01:43:52** So this is like trying to work out now, okay.

**01:43:55** Because this is why it's like this is the whole year project

**01:43:58** is all right, so I've realized maybe I would want

**01:44:00** to have an assistant.

**01:44:01** What would this person actually do?

**01:44:03** I don't know.

**01:44:04** I need to work that out.

**01:44:09** Right, so this is the idea of like I'm realizing these things

**01:44:12** these areas that I think will be very helpful

**01:44:15** for this year structure.

**01:44:17** Right.

**01:44:18** But I need to work out what are the movements

**01:44:21** that need to be made for that to actually make sense

**01:44:24** for me in the long term.

**01:44:26** Like I've realized this area that I want

**01:44:28** and now I need to start putting the pieces in place

**01:44:32** to make it a reality.

**01:44:34** Right, and yeah, okay.

**01:44:35** And so that makes sense then like you need to spend

**01:44:38** all the time to get an assistant to be able

**01:44:41** to start offloading all of this stuff.

**01:44:44** To make the end of next year and the year after much better.

**01:44:47** Right, but getting an assistant is a big project.

**01:44:50** Exactly, if I even start looking for that,

**01:44:52** what will this person do for me?

**01:44:53** Like I need to actually really, and we did that before

**01:44:56** with Carrie when she was coming into the company.

**01:44:58** Like what are the roles in the sales organization

**01:45:01** that require assistance?

**01:45:03** And we went through that process and I worked that out.

**01:45:06** But like this person, this assistant,

**01:45:08** I actually think it's for me,

**01:45:10** it's not for any of my individual things.

**01:45:13** It's not for Relay FM, not for Cortex brand.

**01:45:16** It's for any of the stuff that might come up for me.

**01:45:19** It could span all of that, but I need to think about

**01:45:22** do I need someone to help me with these various tasks?

**01:45:25** This is what you have somebody to help you with, right?

**01:45:29** Yeah, so like I know that your assistant works with you

**01:45:32** for your stuff, your assistant works with me

**01:45:35** and asked for Cortex brand.

**01:45:36** Like I think I maybe need someone

**01:45:38** who's a little bit more involved in various areas, possibly.

**01:45:43** Then there's a couple of other things,

**01:45:45** big focus on Cortex brand, I wanna put more effort in,

**01:45:49** even more continued effort in 2022

**01:45:51** on design and development of products.

**01:45:53** If I was gonna, you know, you have your billion,

**01:45:55** you have your target.

**01:45:58** My target is three new products in 2022.

**01:46:03** Okay.

**01:46:05** We asked for stuff that we're working on.

**01:46:06** Some stuff is harder than others.

**01:46:09** I think this is an achievable goal, but we have to see.

**01:46:12** But I want the time because I want the time

**01:46:15** so I can sit down and work this stuff through

**01:46:18** because as well, like one of the reasons

**01:46:20** I feel like I need this space again

**01:46:23** is trying to realistically grow our business here.

**01:46:28** I need more time for it.

**01:46:30** Yeah.

**01:46:31** And especially the product design side,

**01:46:36** trying to create something new is not something

**01:46:39** that you can do in 90 minutes between two podcasts.

**01:46:44** Because it's just, it isn't possible.

**01:46:46** And so yeah, if that's something, I can see that,

**01:46:51** that if you're wanting to do more of the product design,

**01:46:55** you have to create more unstructured space in your calendar.

**01:46:59** Because I'm like, I'm really excited about this stuff.

**01:47:02** It's a great pleasure for me to do this kind of work.

**01:47:06** It's so different to anything I've ever done before.

**01:47:09** And I love doing it.

**01:47:10** But like the design of the product that we've been working

**01:47:13** on through 2021 came from an afternoon

**01:47:17** where I had a whole afternoon to myself

**01:47:21** and I sat down with my iPad and I started drawing out

**01:47:24** what I thought this thing could look like.

**01:47:25** And then I had this idea at the end of it.

**01:47:28** And I want more of that kind of time.

**01:47:30** Couple of other things.

**01:47:31** I wanna continue my trend of health and fitness,

**01:47:34** continuing to build this into the structure of my life.

**01:47:38** It was an unexpected thing that occurred to me in 2021.

**01:47:41** This was something that I wanted to focus on

**01:47:43** in the way that I have been.

**01:47:45** And I feel like I've built a great base

**01:47:47** to continue moving forward on.

**01:47:49** And I wanna continue making that just a part of me.

**01:47:52** I'm glad to hear that.

**01:47:53** Yeah, it's been unexpected,

**01:47:54** but I'm very happy with the results so far.

**01:47:56** I mean, and if I can say,

**01:47:58** when we finally met up in person most recent time,

**01:48:03** I gave you a hug, you physically felt different.

**01:48:06** So you should be very happy about that.

**01:48:09** Thank you.

**01:48:09** I will say if you hugged me now,

**01:48:11** you would physically feel a vacation.

**01:48:12** But...

**01:48:13** But I know the steps that I would take

**01:48:21** to get back to where I was.

**01:48:23** I find for me, vacation weight, I lose it quite quickly.

**01:48:26** I've always kind of been that way.

**01:48:28** But right now I feel like I've been on holiday.

**01:48:30** That is definitely true.

**01:48:32** When we did that hug, I was also at my most puffy,

**01:48:36** I've just come back from America, wait.

**01:48:38** Puffy is a good way to describe it, honestly.

**01:48:42** America makes me puffy.

**01:48:43** It's totally impossible.

**01:48:44** But I made that call, it's like,

**01:48:45** you know what, I'm gonna be in America for a while,

**01:48:47** it's fine.

**01:48:48** And then so it's like, but I came back and I hugged Mike

**01:48:50** and it was like, oh boy,

**01:48:51** this guy has been on the fitness train.

**01:48:53** I have not.

**01:48:55** But you are right.

**01:48:56** Like, yeah, it does fade away relatively fast

**01:48:59** as far as those things go.

**01:49:00** When she get back into your kind of regular routine.

**01:49:02** Yeah, but I'm really glad to hear

**01:49:03** that you're continuing with it.

**01:49:05** Like it just, it seems like you've really found something

**01:49:08** that works for you.

**01:49:09** And obviously it doesn't fit in with the name of the theme

**01:49:12** in some ways, but it's a great little like sub thing

**01:49:15** to continue onward and to keep in mind over the next year.

**01:49:19** And then this is an interesting one.

**01:49:21** I had this thought while sitting on the beach,

**01:49:24** structured time off.

**01:49:26** I used to work in a company that had allocated vacation days.

**01:49:28** You got like 25 days a year,

**01:49:30** and you had to take 14 of those days in a block.

**01:49:33** You had to take a two week vacation

**01:49:34** and then the rest of it, you could take whatever you wanted.

**01:49:37** And I was thinking about this compared to the idea

**01:49:41** that a lot of tech companies have of unlimited vacation time.

**01:49:45** And it's been basically, there's lots of articles

**01:49:48** and studies to prove this.

**01:49:49** And I believe it from talking to people anecdotally.

**01:49:51** When you have unlimited vacation time,

**01:49:53** you do not take enough vacation.

**01:49:55** Oh yeah, for sure.

**01:49:56** You feel like how do you book it?

**01:49:58** And also the company culture is not built to handle it.

**01:50:03** Because like when I used to work in the bank

**01:50:06** and we had that two week vacation,

**01:50:07** everyone took that two week vacation.

**01:50:09** So everybody knew how to handle somebody else's

**01:50:12** two week vacation.

**01:50:14** Right. Because we all took them.

**01:50:15** So built into the company culture was this idea

**01:50:18** of the two week handover.

**01:50:20** So you finish products to the point that you can,

**01:50:23** then you hand them over to your colleagues

**01:50:25** for a two week period and everyone takes it.

**01:50:27** But if you're on limited vacation time, how does that work?

**01:50:30** I'm gonna take two months off now.

**01:50:32** Is anyone gonna handle this?

**01:50:34** It doesn't work.

**01:50:34** So.

**01:50:35** Right.

**01:50:37** I also realized that traveling, vacation,

**01:50:40** traveling, vacations, whatever,

**01:50:42** helped me stay grounded in a weird way.

**01:50:45** Leaving makes me feel, I don't know what it is,

**01:50:48** but it adds this thing that I enjoy.

**01:50:50** And it hasn't been possible.

**01:50:51** It still won't be like it was, I think,

**01:50:54** for a while, for quite a while.

**01:50:56** But there are feasible breaks, staycations that I can take.

**01:51:00** So my plan is to decide an amount of days

**01:51:04** I take off every year and do it.

**01:51:08** Hmm.

**01:51:08** So I will have allocated vacation days

**01:51:11** that need to be taken every year.

**01:51:13** Maybe it's 25 days, maybe it's more, maybe it's less.

**01:51:17** But I will set them and I will take them

**01:51:19** and that will be a part of the structure of my year.

**01:51:21** I will book them with myself, book them in my calendar,

**01:51:24** let people know that I work with them,

**01:51:26** I'm gonna be doing this and do it.

**01:51:28** May I strongly suggest that this is one of the areas

**01:51:32** of responsibility for your assistant?

**01:51:34** Well, currently this is an area of responsibility

**01:51:37** for my wife because Adina very much agrees with this

**01:51:42** and really likes this and wants to enforce this on me.

**01:51:46** Okay, right.

**01:51:47** Look, the important thing is you have an enforcer

**01:51:50** and if Adina is the enforcer, that's great.

**01:51:53** It also fits with the kind of responsibilities

**01:51:55** that Adina has with our business

**01:51:57** that we run together here in the UK.

**01:51:59** Because weird stuff, right?

**01:52:01** Like all of that stuff that Greg was saying earlier

**01:52:03** about working with companies, it's complicated.

**01:52:06** So we have a business here in the UK

**01:52:08** where we handle all the stuff that we have coming in

**01:52:10** from our various companies, et cetera.

**01:52:12** So it's very complicated.

**01:52:13** But she helps me with running all the finance part of that

**01:52:17** and a lot of logistical stuff that I need to handle.

**01:52:21** And so she feels like this actually fits quite neatly

**01:52:24** with what she would keep her eye on.

**01:52:27** Plus wants to make sure I do it.

**01:52:29** So this is probably a job that she will handle for me.

**01:52:33** And then the last thing that I wanted to think about,

**01:52:36** and this one feels really complicated.

**01:52:38** So I don't really even really know

**01:52:39** if it's something that I'm gonna do,

**01:52:42** but I just thought about it, which was,

**01:52:44** I've spoken about, we've spoken about siloing communication,

**01:52:48** the idea of having different places

**01:52:50** for different types of communication.

**01:52:51** And I've really liked that my Cortex brand email

**01:52:54** all goes to a separate email account.

**01:52:57** I can, a separate email app.

**01:52:59** So like I can, when I wanna be in that,

**01:53:02** I can be in that and I can close it when I don't.

**01:53:04** I am wondering if I can silo my personal stuff

**01:53:09** away from my Relay FM stuff as well now.

**01:53:12** So my notes, my email and my communication

**01:53:17** for the three things that I care about are all different.

**01:53:20** So personal Relay FM Cortex brand.

**01:53:22** Cause my Relay FM stuff and my personal stuff,

**01:53:26** they're all in the same place.

**01:53:28** And I think it might be nice to separate them out

**01:53:30** and have like three different areas.

**01:53:33** But I do not even know if I can feasibly do this

**01:53:36** or if I will like doing it,

**01:53:37** but it's just also something I'm gonna keep in my mind,

**01:53:39** I think, as again, structure, it's all part of structure.

**01:53:43** Right.

**01:53:44** I mean, are you talking about like separating it out

**01:53:47** in terms of like even like iCloud access?

**01:53:49** Like, oh, you'd have a different iCloud account

**01:53:51** for work notes.

**01:53:52** Is that what you mean?

**01:53:53** I don't know.

**01:53:54** Okay, you don't know, you're just, okay.

**01:53:56** Like I'm imagining maybe I would use the Apple Notes app

**01:53:59** for Relay FM stuff and then a different place

**01:54:02** for personal notes, for example.

**01:54:04** Right, right.

**01:54:05** And like I use, maybe would you Spark for my Relay FM email

**01:54:09** and like a different email app for my personal email.

**01:54:13** So I can more easily be in the right modes,

**01:54:16** the right apps at the right time.

**01:54:19** Okay, I see what you mean.

**01:54:20** Cause I have that with Cortex Brands.

**01:54:21** Like if I wanna do Cortex Brands stuff,

**01:54:23** like right, I open the Gmail, whatever app,

**01:54:26** I'll use like Mindstream on my Mac and Kraft.

**01:54:30** And that's all of that stuff, you know?

**01:54:34** But if I wanna do Relay FM stuff, it's like, well, here,

**01:54:37** yeah, but here's also my travel confirmation

**01:54:39** and my Amazon email, like, you know, it's all like mixed in.

**01:54:42** I see what you mean, right?

**01:54:44** And I never really thought it was a thing that I needed,

**01:54:47** but doing it with Cortex Brands has made me realize

**01:54:49** that I actually find value in having it separated like that.

**01:54:54** So I'm thinking about what that might look like too,

**01:54:57** but that's much more a maybe kind of thing.

**01:55:00** It's definitely at the lower and the very bottom

**01:55:03** of the kind of the commitments and the outcomes that I want.

**01:55:06** So kind of in summary, the year of structure

**01:55:10** is about understanding what I need, what I want,

**01:55:13** who can do it for me and what it will take to put it in place.

**01:55:16** Okay, I like it.

**01:55:17** I feel like this is, maybe this is the theme of yours

**01:55:20** that's taken me the longest to get,

**01:55:23** but I think it's a very, like it's very reasonable.

**01:55:26** And I think you've really identified a problem

**01:55:29** with the timing of the way we think about things

**01:55:33** and the actionability of changing the next year.

**01:55:36** Yeah, this one took me a really long time to work out.

**01:55:40** Because it started with some feelings,

**01:55:44** like this feeling of too busy, too overwhelmed.

**01:55:48** And then I had to work out what that meant,

**01:55:50** what that could look like.

**01:55:52** Then I was like, oh, okay, so I'll just,

**01:55:54** my year is about getting everything in order.

**01:55:56** It's like, well, no,

**01:55:57** I actually don't know what I need yet.

**01:56:00** So I need to build this structure over 2022

**01:56:05** to enable me to be more effective and better going forward.

**01:56:09** And things could start to fall into place quite quickly,

**01:56:11** but I'm giving myself the entire year

**01:56:14** to build my new work structure

**01:56:17** because my work has become more complicated now.

**01:56:20** And I've not really taken time

**01:56:22** to look at all of my various responsibilities

**01:56:26** and work out what they actually need

**01:56:28** to be the best that they can be.

**01:56:30** Well, I think we both have some high level stuff

**01:56:33** to work on next year.

**01:56:34** That's why I actually really liked hearing yours

**01:56:36** because I could see that there were some parallels

**01:56:39** in that both of our themes are these ideas for future years.

**01:56:47** Yeah, exactly.

**01:56:48** And like a reframing of what we do,

**01:56:50** rather than like, oh, I'm gonna just focus

**01:56:53** on this one little thing, which is maybe my health,

**01:56:55** or I'm just gonna focus on this one little thing,

**01:56:57** which is maybe my knowledge intake or whatever.

**01:57:00** We're doing like advanced themes now.

**01:57:03** That's where we are in 2022.

**01:57:05** I like that, Mike.

**01:57:06** Let's pitch it that way.

**01:57:06** Yeah, so we're doing the advanced themes for sure.

**01:57:09** We've been doing it for five years now, you know?

**01:57:11** Like we're in like, what is it?

**01:57:12** Like themes 102?

**01:57:14** Is that the advanced class?

**01:57:16** Is that how it works?

**01:57:17** It would be 201.

**01:57:18** 201, okay, we're in themes 201.

**01:57:19** That's what we'll be doing.

**01:57:20** I think it's interesting every year

**01:57:23** sort of to see if we're at the same place

**01:57:24** or if we're at different places.

**01:57:25** And I think this is a byproduct,

**01:57:29** both of the fact that we have been doing the themes

**01:57:31** for a while, but also just the reality for both of us

**01:57:37** of where we are in our careers

**01:57:39** and also a bunch of increasing complexity.

**01:57:42** Like we've both made our lives more complex

**01:57:44** by starting a company together

**01:57:46** in addition to doing the podcast together.

**01:57:49** And so I think it makes sense that we both are now having

**01:57:53** this longer term, more meta thinking kind of work to do.

**01:58:00** If you are setting a theme for yourself,

**01:58:02** we would love to know what that theme is.

**01:58:04** Yes.

**01:58:05** Please leave that in the subreddit

**01:58:06** or you can send them to us on Twitter.

**01:58:09** We would also love if you have questions

**01:58:11** about setting themes and you want advice.

**01:58:14** If you use hashtag Ask Cortex, you can send those into us.

**01:58:18** If you're in the Relay FM members discord,

**01:58:20** you can use question mark Ask Cortex

**01:58:22** and they go to the same sheet

**01:58:23** that we control some questions from.

**01:58:25** Because we'd really love to know,

**01:58:26** I mean, I always find value in the January episode

**01:58:30** kind of talking more about this stuff.

**01:58:32** We always do some reflection.

**01:58:33** So I would love to bring in some Ask Cortex questions

**01:58:36** and maybe share some theme examples that we've liked

**01:58:39** that we've seen people sharing maybe on Reddit or in discord.

**01:58:43** So please send those in.

**01:58:44** And don't forget to buy a theme system journal

**01:58:46** or cortexmerch.com.
