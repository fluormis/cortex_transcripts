# Cortex - 106: Clear and Boring
**00:00:00** I am recording in two places now.

**00:00:02** Oh, I did.

**00:00:03** I am my backup recorder.

**00:00:05** It should be right.

**00:00:06** Don't forget the backup recorder.

**00:00:08** I can't tell if you're serious or not about the backup recorder.

**00:00:11** Are you serious about the backup recorder?

**00:00:13** I would just wish you recorded in two pieces of software instead.

**00:00:16** That's a lot.

**00:00:17** I don't think that's possible to do.

**00:00:19** You can't do that.

**00:00:21** And besides, you want like, you want things physically, you want things physically separated.

**00:00:28** And if it's if it's one computer, it's no good.

**00:00:30** It's like you've got, you know, you need two things physically recording.

**00:00:35** Mm hmm.

**00:00:37** You need to get.

**00:00:38** God damn it.

**00:00:39** Oh, my God. What are you doing?

**00:00:41** For something that you consider to be so important, which is the backup recorder,

**00:00:45** why do you if you seemingly buried it?

**00:00:47** I think the multiple buttons.

**00:00:49** That's a good question.

**00:00:51** Well, OK, so the thing the thing is I'm recording from my new office, Mike,

**00:00:57** my home office is blue now.

**00:00:59** Oh, new is blue.

**00:01:00** Blue is new. Right.

**00:01:02** And I'm mentally considering it to be my new office.

**00:01:07** OK, that's good.

**00:01:08** It's been great.

**00:01:09** But I've also as part of the process of painting it, everything came out of the office

**00:01:15** and went into the main room of our house, which was made things quite cozy for the several days it took to paint.

**00:01:22** I'm sure you were very aware of all the things that you've purchased.

**00:01:25** I became very aware of all the things that I purchased.

**00:01:28** I got rid of a whole bunch of them because, again, I've had collapsed two offices down into one.

**00:01:33** Yeah.

**00:01:33** I moved out of my old one.

**00:01:34** I was like, there's a bunch of redundant stuff that I got rid of.

**00:01:37** And I've just just like re-put everything back into the new blue office.

**00:01:45** And I haven't well, I haven't quite figured out what the storage system is going to be.

**00:01:51** But look, basically, there's been a ton of change here at what I'm thinking of is like the blue engine of SpaceShipU.

**00:01:59** Oh, yeah, it's pretty great.

**00:02:00** I love it. Like I'm so happy about it.

**00:02:03** And it really is the case of like the way you arrange your physical environment matters so much.

**00:02:08** And we can we can talk about this stuff like later.

**00:02:10** But the the short answer to your question is I've spent the last two weeks completely redoing two desks.

**00:02:17** Like I got I got another big desk for this office.

**00:02:20** And like I've set up all of that stuff.

**00:02:23** And to get my office back into a workable state, I just kind of threw a bunch of the stuff that was in my main room into boxes.

**00:02:30** And I was like, you are my project for later boxes.

**00:02:34** Like I'll have to organize you and figure all that stuff out and like get a much better storage system for the various things that I have.

**00:02:42** But what that means is it just occurred to me, I was like, oh, I'm pretty sure that audio recorder is in the box that's behind me.

**00:02:48** And then I took a look and I go, oh, no, it's not in this box.

**00:02:51** I mean, there's only six boxes of things, but they're very dense.

**00:02:56** So we might be, you know, doing a trapeze show here without two nets underneath us, just one net underneath us.

**00:03:02** Did you pick blue because of spaceship?

**00:03:04** You know, Mike, is the other way around.

**00:03:06** It's the it's blue in spaceship.

**00:03:08** You because that's the color for years and years.

**00:03:12** I've always color coded as right.

**00:03:14** Important work.

**00:03:15** But now. But like, did you pick the blue for the office because of that is what I mean.

**00:03:20** And I don't even understand what you're asking.

**00:03:22** Blue is the color of serious work.

**00:03:24** Yeah, but your office wasn't blue before.

**00:03:26** No, I know it wasn't blue before because I just hadn't painted it before.

**00:03:28** But if you had painted it, it always would be below is what I'm asking.

**00:03:32** Yeah, of course. Of course.

**00:03:33** It would like it couldn't be any other.

**00:03:35** It couldn't be any other color.

**00:03:36** It's like it's like, look, Mike, if I if I had like a dedicated recreation room in the house, it would be green because green is the color of like, oh, I'm relaxing now.

**00:03:47** I'm I'm reading a book here.

**00:03:49** That's just the way the colors would be.

**00:03:51** It couldn't you wouldn't make a relaxing room blue.

**00:03:54** That's madness.

**00:03:55** It's a relaxing room has to be green.

**00:04:00** What are you even asking me?

**00:04:03** Yeah, silly me.

**00:04:05** So anyway, I don't have the backup recorder.

**00:04:08** Just a quick thing. Just a quick point of order.

**00:04:10** Something I'd like to bring to the attention of the court.

**00:04:13** Oh, dear. Wait, wait. The cortex.

**00:04:17** No, don't you dare.

**00:04:18** I like to. I would just look.

**00:04:19** I just want like the court extenographer to take it down that I got.

**00:04:24** I got a lot of flack last time for.

**00:04:27** Oh, Gray made a schedule and then he moved the very first incidence of this.

**00:04:33** As Mike said, we didn't even get to one.

**00:04:37** Here we go.

**00:04:37** We didn't we didn't even get to one as like tears rolled down your cheeks into your beard.

**00:04:43** And it's like, yes, yes.

**00:04:45** OK, well, then guess what?

**00:04:46** We didn't get to one again, but it wasn't me this time.

**00:04:50** It was you this time. You moved cortex.

**00:04:52** Right. So I so I just wanted that like officially on the record.

**00:04:57** Oh, our second scheduled time, which would have been the first scheduled time.

**00:05:02** I did not move it. You moved it.

**00:05:04** All right. When was we scheduled for the 10th? Right.

**00:05:07** Oh, I don't know. All right.

**00:05:09** We were scheduled for two days from now, I think, and I've moved it two days earlier.

**00:05:13** Yes. Yes, I did. Two days earlier.

**00:05:16** No, but you see the thing is so great.

**00:05:17** It doesn't it doesn't it's not the same.

**00:05:19** What do you mean it's not the same?

**00:05:20** You can't turn it around on me and be like, of course I can.

**00:05:23** No, but I can completely turn around.

**00:05:26** I'm doing that right now.

**00:05:27** I never set the schedule.

**00:05:28** You set the schedule. So you broke the schedule.

**00:05:30** You set the schedule and I moved it.

**00:05:32** That doesn't matter. It's not my schedule. It's yours.

**00:05:35** Don't give me don't give me this schedule.

**00:05:37** You wanted a schedule for years.

**00:05:39** Yeah, I gave you I gave you a schedule.

**00:05:43** And this is what this is what this sentence means.

**00:05:45** Right. Like I gave it to you wrapped up wrapped up in a little bow.

**00:05:50** I said, here, Mike, all right.

**00:05:51** Here is the thing that you have asked and wanted for years.

**00:05:55** And you were so happy.

**00:05:57** And you know, and now you are only making this situation worse for yourself

**00:06:01** when you move next month.

**00:06:03** Now you're making it a big thing, right?

**00:06:06** Like you are now making it a thing that I moved it.

**00:06:08** So now when you move it, it becomes even bigger.

**00:06:12** Well, basically, you're going to spend every episode for the next year

**00:06:15** having this back and forth conversation.

**00:06:18** Yeah, but no, but look, look, I mean,

**00:06:21** Mike, I know I know what you're trying to say here, but let's get real.

**00:06:24** Neither of us is really expecting that I'm going to be the one

**00:06:28** who really sticks to the schedule like, you know, we don't we both know

**00:06:32** that's not really going to happen.

**00:06:34** So no one's surprised when Gray moves the schedule.

**00:06:38** It's just it's pretty shocking that Mike moved.

**00:06:40** Oh, here we go.

**00:06:42** Here we go.

**00:06:45** OK, you know, you just this thing that I gave you,

**00:06:47** it was just immediately treated very poorly.

**00:06:52** A very good recipient of gifts.

**00:06:54** Yes. And and for a little bit of behind the scenes,

**00:06:57** we almost had to move it just as we were recording now

**00:07:00** because of some stuff that came up, but it was like, oh,

**00:07:03** so we almost we almost got like a double move.

**00:07:05** Something we've never done before is rearrange after we've begun.

**00:07:09** But we ended up pulling the parachute on that one.

**00:07:12** We didn't do it. So anyway, thank you, the court, for hearing that.

**00:07:15** And thank you to the stenographer for getting that down on the record.

**00:07:18** I just it was very important before we begin to have that done. Yeah.

**00:07:21** All right. This September, you can join Relay FM in support of St.

**00:07:24** Jude's Children's Research Hospital.

**00:07:26** September is Childhood Cancer Awareness Month.

**00:07:30** And so we turn our support to St.

**00:07:32** Jude during that period of time.

**00:07:34** Childhood cancer remains the leading cause of death by disease

**00:07:38** for children under the age of 15 and children that are undergoing treatment

**00:07:42** for cancer and other life threatening diseases need transfusions,

**00:07:46** physical and cognitive therapy and so much more.

**00:07:48** But the families of St. Jude patients do not pay a dime for this world

**00:07:53** class care, which is an important thing, especially in America. Right.

**00:07:57** And St. Jude cover the costs for those families.

**00:08:01** Because if you are in that situation and your child has been diagnosed with cancer,

**00:08:07** what you don't want to have to be thinking about is how can I pay for this?

**00:08:11** But as well as being this incredible hospital for children,

**00:08:14** St. Jude is also a world class research institution.

**00:08:18** St. Jude combines the very best in personalized care

**00:08:21** with one of the most technologically advanced treatment clinics in the world.

**00:08:25** It's called the Red Frog Therapy Center.

**00:08:27** This is the very first proton therapy center dedicated solely to children of cancer.

**00:08:32** It has the ability to kill and shrink tumors

**00:08:35** while keeping healthy tissues and organs safe.

**00:08:37** And St. Jude continues to research the use of proton therapy,

**00:08:41** preventing the growth and spread of tumors

**00:08:42** while reducing the risk of treatment related side effects.

**00:08:46** And what's so great about St.

**00:08:47** Jude is because they are a research institution

**00:08:50** and because they are funded by donations.

**00:08:53** They give their research away.

**00:08:54** They don't sell it. They don't keep it for the highest bidder.

**00:08:57** They share their research with institutions all over the world.

**00:09:02** You can donate today at St. Jude dot org slash relay

**00:09:05** and you will be joining the fight to end childhood cancer.

**00:09:08** Once again, that is St. Jude dot org slash relay.

**00:09:11** Please go there today and donate for this incredible cause.

**00:09:16** If you wonder or are wondering why does Relay FM support St. Jude?

**00:09:21** Like St. Jude is a hospital in Memphis, Tennessee.

**00:09:25** Now, this is incredibly personal to us and to me,

**00:09:29** because my co-founder Stephen, his son, Josiah,

**00:09:32** has been a patient at St. Jude since he was a very young baby.

**00:09:35** He was diagnosed with a brain tumor

**00:09:37** and the care and support that St. Jude gave to him

**00:09:41** allowed him to live today without St.

**00:09:44** Jude, things could have gone very differently.

**00:09:46** And I consider Stephen's family like an extension of my own family.

**00:09:50** And to have seen and I have visited St.

**00:09:54** Jude multiple times and seen firsthand what an incredible place this is.

**00:09:58** And the more we have worked with them over the years, the more

**00:10:02** I am convinced of the fact that this is a place that deserves donations

**00:10:08** and we will continue to keep doing it.

**00:10:10** We're trying to raise three hundred and fourteen thousand dollars.

**00:10:13** So we're doing it again, what we raised last year.

**00:10:16** I have been absolutely blown away so far by the support of the Relay FM community.

**00:10:21** And we have raised just an incredible amount of money so far.

**00:10:24** But we need your help to get us to that goal.

**00:10:27** So please go to St Jude dot org slash Relay.

**00:10:30** Yes. Thank you very much.

**00:10:31** Thank you very much to all the cortexians who help support St. Jude.

**00:10:36** So once again, that's St Jude dot org slash Relay.

**00:10:40** Podcast, too, baby.

**00:10:42** It's happening. It's happening real soon.

**00:10:45** Very, very soon.

**00:10:47** Are you very, very prepared for podcast, too?

**00:10:51** By the time people hear this, I will be more prepared than I currently am.

**00:10:56** That will be in the midst of preparing a lot more.

**00:11:00** Hmm. What a what a what a true answer that is.

**00:11:06** In the future, it will be closer to podcast on two than it is now.

**00:11:10** I will. I will talk in a little later on in the episode.

**00:11:12** I will talk about why I am about a week behind the preparations that I wanted to be at.

**00:11:18** But we get anything set up.

**00:11:20** So the podcast with on is going to be a six hour lifestream that we're doing on

**00:11:24** Twitch at Twitch TV, such relay FM on September the 18th from two to eight p.m.

**00:11:29** Eastern time. So you should come and hang out.

**00:11:31** We've got a lot of fun things planned, a lot of weird challenges,

**00:11:34** a lot of great guests from relay FM shows going to be coming on.

**00:11:38** And we're going to be doing a lot of fun stuff.

**00:11:40** But getting getting everything set up is is it's becoming quite a task.

**00:11:46** I think I mentioned on our last episode that I have three areas in mega studio

**00:11:52** that I'm making. Right.

**00:11:53** So I spoke about my lounge area, which is fully done now.

**00:11:57** I've been doing some streams and stuff from there.

**00:11:59** I have kind of a desk area, which is partly set up.

**00:12:03** And then I had a third area that I wasn't talking about, but I will now talk about.

**00:12:08** It is a gazebo full of balloons, or at least it will be so.

**00:12:15** OK, so. OK, so this this goes back to last year.

**00:12:20** Um, at the St. Jude campus, they have these filming facilities

**00:12:26** and they have two studios and we used a large studio

**00:12:30** and then there was a small studio which we maybe would have been able to use.

**00:12:34** And I don't know how it came up, but I was very excited about the possibility of

**00:12:40** every time somebody donated an amount of money, we inflate a balloon

**00:12:43** and put it in this room so it would show donations during the podcast.

**00:12:48** So if you were in the podcastathon, right, you would see the balloons filling this room.

**00:12:52** Right. And I was very excited about the prospect of being in that room

**00:12:56** and like talking, right, like presenting from the balloon room.

**00:13:00** It's very excited about this.

**00:13:02** But it ended up being outside of our scope last year.

**00:13:04** And what we did instead was we created a ball pit that we had.

**00:13:08** So every time somebody donated money, they got their name written on a ball

**00:13:12** and it got thrown in the ball pit.

**00:13:13** And there are many times during the podcast, I was standing in the ball pit

**00:13:18** so I always put podcastathon to wanted to do the balloon room, right?

**00:13:24** I was fixed on the balloon room.

**00:13:26** We're going to do the balloon room, but then we couldn't be in Memphis.

**00:13:29** So I was like, you know what?

**00:13:31** I'm going to make my own balloon room.

**00:13:33** So inside of Mega Studio, OK, we are going to be erecting a gazebo.

**00:13:40** Is there a different word for gazebo in America?

**00:13:43** Is that like the people know what that means?

**00:13:45** I don't know if this is a British term or not.

**00:13:47** You know what I'm talking about, right?

**00:13:49** Well, OK, I think I know what you're talking about because I'm

**00:13:53** harkening back to my time at the craft fairs.

**00:13:57** And I'm assuming that you're talking about one of these kind of setups

**00:14:00** where you have like a booth and yeah, I think I know what you're talking about.

**00:14:05** But now you are suddenly making me doubt.

**00:14:09** Do you mean a gazebo like you would find out on a lawn?

**00:14:12** Like the kind of thing that people get married in?

**00:14:14** Is that what you mean? Yeah.

**00:14:15** But like a small one of those.

**00:14:17** Oh, OK. That's not at all what I had in my head when you were talking.

**00:14:20** OK, so you mean how do the balloons stay in?

**00:14:24** We have netting around it.

**00:14:26** So I was able to find a gazebo.

**00:14:28** OK, that had netted walls. OK.

**00:14:31** So the balloons won't escape and you'll still be able to see in.

**00:14:35** Right. The balloons won't escape and you won't escape.

**00:14:38** You'll just be in. No, I'll just keep walking in and out.

**00:14:41** I mean, again, like as of right now, the gazebo is not up.

**00:14:45** It will be. OK.

**00:14:47** I was like, do you have a picture of this thing?

**00:14:49** But you don't have a picture of this thing because you haven't built it.

**00:14:52** I can show you what it will look like.

**00:14:53** OK, yeah, I would like a photo here because I'm just look, Mike,

**00:14:57** human communication is very hard and suddenly I'm just filled with doubts

**00:15:01** that I have anything in my head like what you're actually doing.

**00:15:03** OK, I just sent you a link to what I have procured.

**00:15:08** OK, let's see what this gazebo looks like.

**00:15:09** They call it a pop up marquee.

**00:15:11** Oh, OK. Well, now that makes me think I'm thinking of the original thing

**00:15:14** that I was thinking of. Yeah, maybe. OK. Right.

**00:15:18** OK, yes. All right. Understand what I'm doing. OK. Yes.

**00:15:20** I understand what you're doing.

**00:15:22** Now, the thing is, this is much closer to what I was imagining.

**00:15:26** Like, say, you know, a young boy would sell

**00:15:29** pretzels out of with his father, like this is much closer to that.

**00:15:32** Yeah. And when you were like, no, no, it's like a gazebo

**00:15:34** that people get married in.

**00:15:35** And then I was thinking of like a wooden thing in a park.

**00:15:38** And I was I just didn't know what was going on here.

**00:15:40** Yeah, no, that was the wrong one.

**00:15:41** But like so. But now you say that like the wooden ones,

**00:15:44** yeah, but people also get married in marquees, right,

**00:15:48** which is just kind of close to but bigger ones.

**00:15:51** Anyway, this is what I am erecting in the studio inside of my studio.

**00:15:56** OK. And we'll be filling with balloons

**00:15:59** with the idea that as we raise money during the podcastathon,

**00:16:02** the balloon room will get more full.

**00:16:05** I like it. And I will be able to be inside the big full balloon room.

**00:16:09** Obviously, to do this requires the pre-filling of many, many

**00:16:13** hundreds of balloons, right?

**00:16:16** You're not going to fill them live on air.

**00:16:19** Some for sure. OK.

**00:16:21** But not all because otherwise the sound of balloons being inflated

**00:16:25** will be the entire six hours, right?

**00:16:29** So we're going to fill up many hundreds of balloons in advance.

**00:16:32** Me and Adina here in Mega Studio.

**00:16:35** Put them in nets, put them behind the gazebo and slowly fill up the gazebo.

**00:16:40** Are you filling them with helium?

**00:16:41** Like they're going to fill them. No, I thought about helium,

**00:16:44** but there was a couple of things of helium.

**00:16:46** One, the ceilings of Mega Studio were very high.

**00:16:50** Right. And I don't want to be dealing with that.

**00:16:53** And two, helium balloons will go to the top,

**00:16:57** which won't have the visual effect of filling.

**00:16:59** Right. Right. It will go the other way.

**00:17:02** Yeah. It'll more be like helium balloons are crushing you from above.

**00:17:05** Right. I wasn't planning to say anything,

**00:17:06** but I was also just wondering what is the like those those gazebos

**00:17:11** as you call them, like they're not that heavy.

**00:17:15** And I was just beginning to wonder, like, what's what's the maximum thrust

**00:17:19** of all of these balloons?

**00:17:20** And I was going to keep real quiet if that would have been actually

**00:17:23** quite a fun thing to have occurred. Right.

**00:17:25** But I like how how many balloons until the gazebo leaves the ground

**00:17:31** would have been quite a fun moment.

**00:17:33** But no, we're going to be doing air and air.

**00:17:36** That's like that's the big thing I've been keeping under my hat.

**00:17:39** I mean, so here's the thing, like when when I'm releasing this episode,

**00:17:43** because of things I will get to later in this episode,

**00:17:45** we have not had the ability to start the setup of this.

**00:17:48** So I'm putting it all on the line here.

**00:17:51** Great. Has the gazebo been delivered?

**00:17:53** Like, is it in? Oh, I have it all.

**00:17:55** I have everything. I have many hundreds of balloons.

**00:17:57** I have an inflating machine.

**00:17:59** I have the gazebo, the nets and the whole nine yards.

**00:18:02** OK, great. Then you're set.

**00:18:04** What could go wrong? I know what could go wrong.

**00:18:06** It feels like everything. I have everything.

**00:18:07** How could anything go wrong?

**00:18:09** So we've we've put up the metal part and taken it down again.

**00:18:12** So we know it fits because it's massive.

**00:18:16** Because finally enough, gazebo is difficult to buy during Covid.

**00:18:22** Why? Out of stock everywhere,

**00:18:24** because people put them up in their gardens.

**00:18:26** Oh, I was like, people should be outside.

**00:18:30** What are they doing? But they're in the gardens, right?

**00:18:32** Right. They're making little rooms for themselves in their gardens.

**00:18:35** Right. So it ended up being a thing

**00:18:37** that was trickier to procure than I had expected.

**00:18:40** Hmm. What are you going to do with it long term?

**00:18:43** Don't know, man.

**00:18:45** I haven't thought that far out yet.

**00:18:46** OK, so when it is up, what percent of the floor space of Mega Studio

**00:18:52** would you say it's taking up?

**00:18:54** Good, 25 percent.

**00:18:56** So it's probably not something you'd want to leave up indefinitely.

**00:19:00** Oh, it's coming down again for sure.

**00:19:02** But when it's down, it's it's very small, actually.

**00:19:05** I was I was just thinking, like, maybe this could be a fun

**00:19:08** like VR room for you.

**00:19:10** You can have like, oh, the gazebo is now the VR cave.

**00:19:13** But if it's 25 percent of Mega Studio, you probably don't want to do that.

**00:19:16** That is a fun idea, but it's far too big

**00:19:20** to be a permanent fixture.

**00:19:22** But yeah, I will keep it because like, you know,

**00:19:25** you never know when you need a balloon room, I guess.

**00:19:28** But also when it's down, it's not that large at all.

**00:19:31** Yes, it's like a pretty small box that goes inside.

**00:19:34** Hmm. Well, that will be delightful.

**00:19:37** It's one of the many, many fun things that we have planned for podcast

**00:19:41** ATHON 2, but is part of the very, very large job

**00:19:47** for a two person team to put together.

**00:19:50** But if you're going to do it, go for it.

**00:19:52** And that's what we're doing, right?

**00:19:53** We just go for it.

**00:19:54** See what happens and we're going to have fun along the way.

**00:19:57** And it's going to be this week is going to be wild.

**00:20:00** I would like the time tracking numbers for filling balloons.

**00:20:03** Like I'd love to see what percent of the year that ends up being later on.

**00:20:07** That would be great.

**00:20:09** I'll let you know. It's going to be a combined number.

**00:20:12** It's not just me, thankfully, filling these things.

**00:20:15** Yes, you, Mike, you are a very, very busy boy this upcoming week.

**00:20:20** I do not I do not envy you.

**00:21:57** I've been doing a lot of Twitch streaming in the lead up to the podcast

**00:22:00** athon, so like we've been doing some additional streams, games

**00:22:04** and some in-person kind of stuff, too.

**00:22:07** And I am reminded how much I enjoy streaming as an activity.

**00:22:14** What do you like about it?

**00:22:15** I like that there's so much additional stuff that you can do

**00:22:19** that you can't do with audio, right?

**00:22:21** Like it's video. It's the video thing, right?

**00:22:22** Like, you know, I can play games.

**00:22:25** I can show things like I've been doing some show

**00:22:29** and tell of my growing keyboard collection.

**00:22:32** No, the keyboard collection.

**00:22:33** Yeah, we'll come back to that.

**00:22:35** So many so many so many keyboards.

**00:22:38** It's yeah, it's a collection now.

**00:22:40** It's a thing. I got a big thing in my life at the moment.

**00:22:45** But so like I'm enjoying that.

**00:22:46** And what I like about the about Twitch streaming specifically

**00:22:51** is it doesn't have the overhead of post video, right?

**00:22:54** Like there's no editing.

**00:22:57** It has many of the things that I enjoy about video as a medium

**00:23:01** without me having to think about putting in the many hours of work

**00:23:05** of the editing and publishing that YouTube does. Right.

**00:23:08** Is that is that just because of the expectations of the platform

**00:23:10** or is that a side effect of Twitch ditches your streams after?

**00:23:14** I don't know what it is.

**00:23:15** What is like a month or something?

**00:23:16** All the streams go away. I don't know.

**00:23:17** I mean, you can I mean, I can host them on the YouTube channel

**00:23:19** and I'm planning on doing that for some stuff.

**00:23:21** But it's just the fact that like all there is from a production

**00:23:25** perspective is the is what's happened live.

**00:23:29** And then and then that's the end.

**00:23:31** That's the video. Right.

**00:23:32** So like there's nothing more to do after that period of time, really.

**00:23:36** Like there is no edit to do for for me with what I'm doing

**00:23:40** because it's not like the vlogs or it's not like product review videos

**00:23:46** where like you do all the filming and then you start all the editing.

**00:23:50** Right. The Twitch stream is just like this is what I produced

**00:23:53** and you can choose to have been there when it was happening

**00:23:57** or you can choose to watch it after the fact.

**00:23:59** And that's all it is.

**00:24:01** And I think I kind of like that.

**00:24:03** And I'm thinking about maybe now I have room and space and stuff like that

**00:24:08** here in the studio, like trying to make more and more permanent setup for that

**00:24:13** is definitely something that I'm going to consider.

**00:24:16** Like I'd spoken about always spoken about having like video ambitions here

**00:24:20** because I will be able to set stuff up and have it be more permanent.

**00:24:24** But I think now that I will probably be turning my attention

**00:24:29** more towards streaming than producing some basically more towards Twitch than YouTube.

**00:24:35** It's just the casualness of it. That's what you like.

**00:24:37** Yeah, I like the casualness of the actual video itself.

**00:24:41** Like the making of it.

**00:24:43** Like I like the interaction method of streaming, like talking to people

**00:24:47** that are in the chat room, like in the live chat and stuff like that.

**00:24:51** I enjoy that.

**00:24:52** I find it to be quite chill, actually, like as a way of producing content.

**00:24:57** It is much more relaxed for me than other types of stuff that I make.

**00:25:02** Like the expectations are different.

**00:25:04** So I find that quite relaxing as a content production thing.

**00:25:08** And I also just like that it's you sit down, you do the thing, you get up and you're done.

**00:25:12** There's no more.

**00:25:14** All that's there is what you did.

**00:25:16** What you put into it when you are live is all that exists.

**00:25:20** And I kind of find that quite refreshing

**00:25:23** because that's not like the other content that I make.

**00:25:26** Yeah, I don't know.

**00:25:28** I feel like I've had this.

**00:25:30** I keep asking because I've had this like.

**00:25:34** On and off again, like what is live streaming?

**00:25:38** Like I don't know, I just I never feel like I'm able to.

**00:25:42** Get into it like I've never found.

**00:25:45** Content creators that have been like, oh, I really enjoy watching a bunch of this live stuff.

**00:25:51** Yeah, I have also been watching way more to extremes.

**00:25:54** OK, so like that's part of it is like I've found a type of content that I like to watch,

**00:26:01** which is people building keyboards.

**00:26:04** No, OK, right.

**00:26:06** Hanging out and building keyboards.

**00:26:07** And I've been enjoying that content.

**00:26:09** I find it very relaxing to watch.

**00:26:13** So like it's content that I am.

**00:26:16** Watching like semi actively, you know.

**00:26:20** Right. Yeah, I mean, I can get that like.

**00:26:23** I mean, the the most recent live thing I did watch was I did watch

**00:26:27** Stephen put the wheels on his Mac Pro.

**00:26:29** Like, oh, yeah, you see stuff like that.

**00:26:31** So like he mentioned on that stream, an idea that I am saying that I really want him to do.

**00:26:37** So I'm now going to say on this show as a way to push him further.

**00:26:41** So there was a show called This Old House in America, right?

**00:26:44** I think it was like a home renovation show or something.

**00:26:47** And he referenced like this old Mac where like maybe every Sunday

**00:26:51** he could take apart an old Mac and show you the insides.

**00:26:54** And I just thought like, yeah, man, like I would love that.

**00:26:58** Right. Because I like I think I have come to enjoy this like.

**00:27:03** Calm, comforting.

**00:27:06** Type of content that the in-person Twitch streaming can be.

**00:27:12** Hmm. Right. And I think like a lot of the time on Twitch is called like

**00:27:16** just chatting or whatever, but I like there to be a thing that's going on

**00:27:20** as well as the interaction.

**00:27:21** So like with the keyboard streamers that I watch, they're doing something

**00:27:26** and also having conversations with the people that are there in the Twitch chat.

**00:27:30** Right. So I like the mixture of that, which is like the calm conversation.

**00:27:36** A lot of them as well have like beds of calming music through the streams,

**00:27:40** which I also really like, like the lo-fi hip-hop type stuff.

**00:27:44** Yes. No, no.

**00:27:45** I feel like your your watchword for this one is calm, right?

**00:27:50** Like you said it so like Mike wants something that's calm.

**00:27:54** And I was just I was just trying to think of like the few things that I've seen

**00:27:57** that's live and I was and I'm trying to like bring some stuff up in my mind

**00:28:01** that's similar to this.

**00:28:03** But a friend of mine, I did get into it for a little bit, but not permanently.

**00:28:08** A friend of mine showed me these.

**00:28:11** I don't know how to describe it like these crazy Mario Maker levels like.

**00:28:15** Yeah. The world's most insanely difficult levels of Mario that you have ever seen.

**00:28:21** As for someone who was totally unfamiliar with Mario Maker, it was very like,

**00:28:25** what is this madness?

**00:28:27** Yeah, it's a wild game.

**00:28:28** I never really got into it, but but I can see why people like it.

**00:28:31** Yeah. But anyway, so the thing about those streams is like, yes,

**00:28:34** the person who's playing the this this incredibly hard level

**00:28:37** is casually chatting with the audience about whatever.

**00:28:41** But I would not describe it as calm because in the background,

**00:28:45** they're pulling off just these totally insane maneuvers.

**00:28:49** And all I could think of is how can you possibly have a conversation with anyone

**00:28:53** while you're also doing these unbelievably God tier level moves in the background?

**00:28:59** Well, that's because to them it's like it's flow, right?

**00:29:03** Yes, I'm sure it is.

**00:29:04** I'm sure it is. But I don't think it wasn't like a calming

**00:29:08** viewing experience, right?

**00:29:10** Right. Whereas watching Steven put the wheels on his Mac Pro.

**00:29:16** And I watched it, but I also felt like, oh, this is like a like a weird art project

**00:29:20** that he's doing over here.

**00:29:21** And it was a much more relaxing experience.

**00:29:25** So that's kind of like.

**00:29:27** Where I am with this right where like I am in it's like, you know,

**00:29:32** I I feel like it's a common thing for me,

**00:29:35** where if I find a type of content that I enjoy consuming,

**00:29:38** I like to see if I can do it.

**00:29:41** Yeah, right.

**00:29:42** This is this is a trait of me that I have come to realize about myself

**00:29:45** maybe in the last year where like I've started to think like, why do I do?

**00:29:50** I try I try lots of things, right?

**00:29:52** And see what works and see what I like and what doesn't like.

**00:29:54** And it's very frequent that like I will come across a style of content.

**00:29:58** I will consider, can I try that?

**00:30:00** I like consuming it.

**00:30:02** Would I like making it?

**00:30:03** And I try and sometimes it sticks and sometimes it doesn't.

**00:30:06** And I've kind of always been this way, but I've kind of become

**00:30:09** self aware about this of myself maybe in the last year or so.

**00:30:12** So it's like similar, like I have enjoyed watching this type of content.

**00:30:17** It is about a thing that I am becoming increasingly interested in.

**00:30:21** And so maybe I will try doing some of it myself.

**00:30:24** And I've been doing a couple of streams in this vein during September,

**00:30:29** because as we've been hitting different fundraising amounts through the campaign,

**00:30:33** we've been doing content and Stephen's wheel thing was one of those.

**00:30:37** He basically changed the feet out of his Mac Pro to the really expensive wheels.

**00:30:42** Right. And like I really enjoyed watching Stephen do that in a similar vein

**00:30:47** where it was like it was really chill.

**00:30:49** And I think I like that kind of I like I have come to enjoy that kind of content.

**00:30:54** And so I'm also thinking, like, are there things that I can do in that space?

**00:31:00** Maybe. Yeah.

**00:31:01** Well, it's it's also it's also a very natural part of the

**00:31:06** creative process that it doesn't matter what it is.

**00:31:09** Like if it's if it's live streaming, you know, you watch a bunch

**00:31:12** of different content creators making live stream stuff

**00:31:15** and then you start to develop.

**00:31:19** Like preferences or like genre sensitivities where you think, oh,

**00:31:23** I like it when people do this or I don't like it when people do that.

**00:31:26** And then I think it can very naturally just

**00:31:31** lead you into thinking, oh, if I was going to do a version of this, how how would I do it?

**00:31:37** And and yeah, I think that can just naturally happen for any kind of entertainment.

**00:31:42** Yeah. I mean, I know when I made that T-quay video, I watched like a billion

**00:31:46** urban exploration videos around that time.

**00:31:48** I'm just like, what's this genre like?

**00:31:51** You know what? You know, when I'm putting this together, what do people do that?

**00:31:54** I like and what do people do that? I don't like.

**00:31:56** Let me try to make my version of this thing.

**00:31:58** And I think I think that happens really naturally with any kind of creative project.

**00:32:01** I mean, the flip side of that is it's sort of cliche, but it is true

**00:32:06** where you sometimes run into people where they're like, oh, you know, I'm

**00:32:09** working on a on a novel or whatever.

**00:32:12** You're like, do you read a lot of fiction?

**00:32:14** No, no, I don't read a lot of fiction, but I'm writing this novel.

**00:32:17** It's like, oh, no, project is doomed.

**00:32:21** Yeah, I think it's pretty normal in the like for people that are creative.

**00:32:25** Right. Yeah.

**00:32:26** You look at something and when you start to like it, you can't help but think,

**00:32:30** like, can I do that, too?

**00:32:32** And how would I do that if I was going to do that?

**00:32:35** And like it ends up becoming a thing.

**00:32:37** And I think certain people will not make it, but I almost can't help myself

**00:32:42** but to always want to try.

**00:32:44** Yeah. Yeah. And I can see, you know, chill live with Mike as a

**00:32:48** as a future project for sure.

**00:32:49** Like, it sounds very up your alley.

**00:32:52** It fits for me.

**00:32:54** Basically, I want to get to a point where I learn and I'm learning

**00:32:59** to build my own keyboards, right?

**00:33:01** From you buy the kits and you put them together.

**00:33:04** And I kind of figure if I'm going to want to learn that anyway,

**00:33:08** I may as well just do this stuff on live streams, right?

**00:33:11** Like it just. Oh, OK.

**00:33:12** So you want to live stream the process.

**00:33:15** Hmm. OK. All right. That makes sense.

**00:33:17** Yeah. So something I'm thinking about.

**00:33:19** I'm kind of just putting I'm just noodling on it a little bit.

**00:33:22** Like you're going to learn soldering.

**00:33:23** Is that one of the things you do?

**00:33:25** Soldering is fun.

**00:33:26** I've never done it.

**00:33:27** It feels like one of those things where it's kind of missing from my geek

**00:33:32** them to have done anything with electronics.

**00:33:36** Right. You're your geek resume.

**00:33:38** Right. You want to put soldering on there?

**00:33:40** Yeah, I want to get the badge, right?

**00:33:43** Yeah. I was just thinking is like the merit badge.

**00:33:45** You can you can prove like able to poorly solder two things together.

**00:33:49** Great. They didn't fall apart immediately.

**00:33:53** Yes, exactly.

**00:33:54** Because I've never really done anything like that.

**00:33:56** This feels like a low stakes thing to try.

**00:33:59** You know, so yeah, I just want to give it a go.

**00:34:03** And basically, it all comes back to that tweet that was sent into this show.

**00:34:09** The Ask Cortex question that we had, it was like in which started this whole journey.

**00:34:15** It was from someone called Noit.

**00:34:17** And they sent this back in 2019.

**00:34:19** But we read it on a show much later, basically saying,

**00:34:23** if either of you have ever used mechanical keyboards,

**00:34:25** have you ever been tempted further down the rabbit hole to fancy a keyboard?

**00:34:29** I can see Mike's love of pens transporting to this.

**00:34:33** Right. And they were right.

**00:34:34** Like, and there's this kind of interest, this kind of hobby.

**00:34:38** I think it actually intersects with a lot of things that I like,

**00:34:42** because it also is technology, you know, as well as being collecting

**00:34:47** and customization and stuff like that.

**00:34:50** So why not turn it into some kind of content?

**00:34:53** But what I don't want to do is make a podcast.

**00:34:55** Like, I don't don't want to do that. I have no interest in that.

**00:34:58** Yeah. And it's something like Mike learns to build a keyboard,

**00:35:02** his poor podcast content that doesn't.

**00:35:04** It's just not suited for it.

**00:35:05** Right. No, but I could make a version of the pan addict, but with keyboards,

**00:35:11** not Mike learning, but like Mike being interested in this hobby,

**00:35:15** finding someone more knowledgeable than him to help teach him

**00:35:19** and the audience if they're interested.

**00:35:22** And then over time, my knowledge builds and then it becomes talking about

**00:35:26** what new products exist in the world.

**00:35:28** Right. Like there is definitely the pan addict model

**00:35:32** would fit for keyboards easy, but I don't want to do that.

**00:35:36** Just because I was I think I've said this before on on the show of like

**00:35:41** when I was talking about having hobbies and this is definitely a hobby.

**00:35:43** It's like not turning it into work.

**00:35:47** And the streaming stuff.

**00:35:48** Hard to do. Right.

**00:35:49** But exactly.

**00:35:50** But the streaming stuff is like, I don't really think of that as

**00:35:54** at the moment, I'll say this.

**00:35:55** I mean, who knows?

**00:35:56** Like, oh, my.

**00:35:58** Come on. You know.

**00:36:00** Oh, I don't really think of this as work yet.

**00:36:03** It's far enough away at the moment from what I do.

**00:36:08** Right. For a living.

**00:36:10** And if it ended up becoming something that was work like,

**00:36:13** that would mean that it was successful.

**00:36:15** Otherwise, it's just maintained to be my hobby.

**00:36:18** But I don't feel the same.

**00:36:22** Twitch streaming than I do recording shows.

**00:36:26** Like it does.

**00:36:27** It's working different parts of my brain.

**00:36:29** It's like I really loved recording videos.

**00:36:32** I hated editing them

**00:36:34** because editing was too close to the editing that I do for audio.

**00:36:38** You know.

**00:36:40** So, yeah, pandemic busy, my friend.

**00:36:43** And I make busy.

**00:36:44** Yeah, you're going to you're going to add live streamer to repertoire here.

**00:36:47** And again, it's like as soon as as soon as you start getting,

**00:36:51** you know, whatever it is, like the Twitch version of of YouTube

**00:36:54** super chats like Twitch donations, like then it's going to suddenly become

**00:36:58** much more much more work like.

**00:37:01** But like you said, that just means that it's become a successful project.

**00:37:05** But it's it's charming to hear you say that now at the beginning of it.

**00:37:08** Like, oh, this isn't work.

**00:37:09** I'm knowing my boundaries, though, right?

**00:37:11** Yeah. Well, like I have set the boundary

**00:37:13** if I'm not starting a podcast about mechanical keyboards.

**00:37:16** That boundary is set.

**00:37:17** I think I think that's the right decision.

**00:37:19** And if I want to dabble in other things, I will allow myself to do that.

**00:37:24** Because as well, it's an expensive hobby.

**00:37:25** So if I if I want to do it, trying to make some money from it is a good like

**00:37:31** that's good for the spreadsheets. Right. Right.

**00:37:33** You're going to try to recoup that.

**00:37:35** I can try and bring some of that money back into the business a little bit.

**00:37:38** But like it feels like something to play around with in an area which could be

**00:37:43** which intersects, I think, enough with some of my other hobbies.

**00:37:46** So I kind of want to tinker with it without integrating it into my current creative work.

**00:37:52** That's kind of the important part for me is I want it to be adjacent,

**00:37:55** not part of what I'm already doing if I do it.

**00:37:59** Yeah, which you totally are going to do.

**00:38:01** Well, you know, we'll say the podcast that's on being over is going to free up

**00:38:05** quite a lot of time in my schedule.

**00:38:06** I can't watch. I'm excited about busy, busy Mike.

**00:39:47** So the reactions to our last episode were incredibly fun.

**00:39:51** They fell into two camps.

**00:39:53** People who were shocked like me that it had never come up that me and you

**00:39:57** understood note taking so fundamentally differently.

**00:40:02** And people that were surprised that they took notes the same way that you did

**00:40:08** or thought about notes the same way that you did

**00:40:10** and didn't know that the rest of the world thought differently to them.

**00:40:16** Yeah, yeah, there's there's a lot of feedback.

**00:40:19** I don't know. I just I felt like

**00:40:22** I was in literal pain listening back to that episode for my pass of the edit.

**00:40:28** I was like, oh, no, past Grey is doing such a terrible job explaining anything here.

**00:40:34** And it's just like this is just this is what he sounds like when he's in the middle

**00:40:37** of a project. It seemed like there was definitely an episode that caused a lot

**00:40:41** of discussion and generated a lot of interesting feedback.

**00:40:44** But for me, I was mostly like, oh, why do I explain things so poorly

**00:40:48** when I'm in the middle of them? But are you going to take another crack at it?

**00:40:52** No, I'm not going to take another crack at it because I'm still because I'm still

**00:40:55** in the middle of it. Right. I'm still like, don't rush me, Mike.

**00:40:58** I don't know. I don't know what you are in it.

**00:41:01** Right. This is me asking you.

**00:41:03** Yeah, I'm I'm still very in the middle of this.

**00:41:07** I don't know. I think I partly sounded like just a complete weirdo on the last

**00:41:11** episode. And a lot of a lot of the feedback seemed to line up with that.

**00:41:14** Like, how does how does he do anything if he's not doing what I think of his notes?

**00:41:19** That was that was an overwhelming tidal wave of feedback of like,

**00:41:23** how are you able to accomplish your job at all if you don't take notes?

**00:41:29** Well, that feedback also came directly from me to you.

**00:41:32** I still don't feel like I fully understand how you manage anything, really.

**00:41:38** Yeah. And there's a and there's still totally

**00:41:40** a part of me which is like, I don't know about these notes.

**00:41:42** I don't know about this.

**00:41:45** Yeah, I feel like this is going to be a longer threat for a while.

**00:41:50** Yeah, I mean, maybe, maybe again, I'm I'm I'm still very much on the side of just

**00:41:55** that brains are really different.

**00:41:57** And I think the feedback itself just totally demonstrated this,

**00:42:01** that there is a way that some portion of the population does think about notes in

**00:42:06** the way that I do, which is like, what is this?

**00:42:07** What is this for?

**00:42:10** And you think you could see it pop up where it was the same thing where they're

**00:42:13** like, oh, the other people are really doing something.

**00:42:16** I just always assumed it was nonsense, too.

**00:42:19** And this is what I mean.

**00:42:20** Just like brains are different and you can find these little divisions,

**00:42:23** but they're just not you just don't know where they're going to be.

**00:42:26** Or it's not obvious where they're where they're going to pop up.

**00:42:29** But, yeah, I am still I am still very in the middle of this.

**00:42:34** I'm still sort of.

**00:42:36** Working out what what the new system will be.

**00:42:40** So I don't I don't.

**00:42:41** I don't have a lot of specific follow up like you may have hoped on this on this

**00:42:46** topic, but I wasn't expecting much being honest.

**00:42:51** Yeah, I just wondered how if you'd gotten any further and if you had how far.

**00:42:58** Yeah. So I guess I guess I would say while while I don't

**00:43:04** have a clear direction forward at this point, I have very clearly decided,

**00:43:12** oh, the past.

**00:43:15** Goodbye.

**00:43:16** I'm just going to dump some kerosene on all of my ever notes, walk away and throw

**00:43:22** a match over my shoulder from year zero.

**00:43:25** We're beginning again.

**00:43:26** And let's figure out from here what the new glorious future will be.

**00:43:30** And I've picked intentionally two video

**00:43:35** topics for the next two projects that are almost like toy projects that are easy to

**00:43:43** play around with this topic of, oh, how would notes work?

**00:43:46** And that's what I'm working on while I'm

**00:43:49** trying to figure out, like, what is the new system going forward?

**00:43:52** Also, especially after the, you know, personally crushing T-Coi incident,

**00:43:59** like it's useful anyway to pick lighter

**00:44:02** topics for the next two videos instead of some of my original plans,

**00:44:06** which were like very complicated videos, I was like, you know what?

**00:44:10** This is not the time to do that.

**00:44:12** So I picked a couple of toy topics of like, OK, these are easy to do.

**00:44:16** I know I won't run into any major problems here.

**00:44:20** And the first one stylistically, I'm even doing it.

**00:44:23** So it's very clear that this is not a 100 percent serious video.

**00:44:28** So it's like if there's a if there's a minor factual error, like it's fine,

**00:44:32** because this is clearly not supposed to be like an encyclopedia entry on this topic.

**00:44:36** And so that's sort of what I've done topic wise for what I'm working on.

**00:44:41** And I also think the the freedom and the

**00:44:44** lightness of topics gives me a lot of room to play around with what the system is or

**00:44:49** how how do the notes work and because they're smaller topics, I can like just

**00:44:54** crunch up a bunch of stuff I've worked on and try to format it in a different way

**00:44:57** and see how that works.

**00:44:58** So I'm just I'm very experimental.

**00:45:00** I'm very experimental with notes for the time being.

**00:45:03** And I'm just sort of seeing seeing what's going on and trying to figure out what

**00:45:06** the what the future will be.

**00:45:08** But I guess that's also a little bit of saying for the YouTube audience.

**00:45:12** Maybe it's now a time to be a bit patient on when the next video will be like I'm

**00:45:17** I'm doing a total like once in a decade reboot of the way I work.

**00:45:24** Interesting.

**00:45:25** It's a choice that you make, right?

**00:45:26** You can you can choose that like I'm going to make this change before the next

**00:45:29** video or you can be like, well, I'm going to keep working the old way and develop

**00:45:34** the new way. But I can understand from your perspective that,

**00:45:37** well, the reason this is happening is not because you had a new idea or found a new

**00:45:42** system that you thought might be fun to play around in.

**00:45:45** If you've highlighted that you need to to look at this as a potential way to help

**00:45:50** you in the future, then you'd be kind of foolish to not do this beforehand.

**00:45:54** You know, I took it very seriously.

**00:45:56** What I said at the end of the CGP Grey was Wrong video of like, oh, like I've done

**00:45:59** this autopsy and like at the end of that video, I say, oh, you know, if we need to

**00:46:03** change things, we're going to change things.

**00:46:04** I didn't specify because I just didn't have any idea like what that specifically

**00:46:08** would mean. But that has very directly translated into like, OK,

**00:46:12** I need to rethink the way I do primary sources and my notes on primary sources.

**00:46:16** I also just realized I said it in a slightly strange way there.

**00:46:18** But when I mean like the next video, I think what I

**00:46:22** do is a clear way to say it is like excluding these couple of toy projects

**00:46:27** where I'm just experimenting like the next heavyweight video.

**00:46:31** You have some light grey videos, maybe.

**00:46:34** Yeah, something something along those lines.

**00:46:37** Stuff that isn't maybe it's easier to say,

**00:46:39** like stuff that in nature is not something that requires heavy research like Tikoi did.

**00:46:45** Exactly. Right.

**00:46:47** So, OK, would you call it Grey Explains in that sense?

**00:46:50** Yeah. Yeah. OK.

**00:46:51** Yeah, the videos, the toy projects are still like they're going to get that

**00:46:56** official logo on the side, which makes them like the official real Grey Explains

**00:47:00** videos. But the topics have just been selected for very limited scope.

**00:47:05** Gersko. Gersko. Yeah.

**00:47:07** Well, it's it's also like it's been a good time to like step back and take a

**00:47:12** not a break exactly, but just do a rethink.

**00:47:15** You're reevaluating some stuff.

**00:47:17** Yeah, that that Grey was Wrong project was was extremely taxing on a very short

**00:47:25** period of time. And I just knew like, OK, this this costs a lot of like work points

**00:47:32** that are going to take a long amount of time to recharge.

**00:47:35** And so like doing the note stuff is a good thing to be tinkering with like while

**00:47:40** I'm building back up to that.

**00:47:42** And then when I was thinking about it, it was like, OK, well, if I'm burning the past,

**00:47:46** the future is now totally, totally gone.

**00:47:48** And all of my vague plans for like, oh, this is the rough outline of the next six

**00:47:53** videos, I was like, forget that whoosh in the garbage to like today is a new day.

**00:47:59** Like from right now, given what you know, like what topics would you select?

**00:48:03** If nothing else mattered, I was like, OK, there's two obvious ones that I can play

**00:48:08** with. And then I'll do a reevaluation of what the what the rest of the topics are

**00:48:12** going to be. So so that's a little bit of of where I am with with the redoing of the

**00:48:17** notes. Well, I look forward to coming back to it further.

**00:48:21** I really look forward actually to finding out which app you end up landing on.

**00:48:25** That that's the thing that I'm interested in.

**00:48:28** That's all people want to know.

**00:48:29** People want to know about apps.

**00:48:31** Of course they do.

**00:48:32** They want to know.

**00:48:33** Let me rephrase it. People in general probably don't care.

**00:48:36** Cortexons, they really care.

**00:48:38** Yeah, no, Cortexons really care about the apps.

**00:48:41** And also I get it.

**00:48:42** Right. Like we all know like, oh, gear is the most exciting.

**00:48:46** The apps are the most interesting, right, because they are the physical and digital

**00:48:51** instantiations of ideas.

**00:48:53** I do totally get why people care.

**00:48:55** You know, what pen did you write that novel with?

**00:48:58** People want to know. I do have some initial thoughts.

**00:49:02** OK. So there's this phenomenon where once

**00:49:05** you notice something, you notice it everywhere.

**00:49:07** It's the Bader-Meinhof phenomenon.

**00:49:09** Yes, thank you. I was like, I couldn't remember the name for it.

**00:49:11** It's one of the only things like this.

**00:49:12** I remember because I love bringing it up and I had to look it up so many times

**00:49:17** that it stuck in my brain. OK, how do you say it?

**00:49:20** It's Bader-Meinhof. Bader-Meinhof.

**00:49:22** OK, how would you explain it to the audience then if you've looked it up so many times?

**00:49:26** So the Bader-Meinhof phenomenon is you become

**00:49:28** aware of something and then you see it everywhere in real life.

**00:49:31** A good example is for people is like you buy a car or someone you know buys a car

**00:49:36** and then you see that model of car everywhere.

**00:49:38** Right, right.

**00:49:39** So I'm having I don't know if it is this phenomenon.

**00:49:44** I have a suspicion that it's kind of not, but at the same time,

**00:49:47** I also feel like, oh, the whole world of notes is going through a revolution right now.

**00:49:53** No, you have hit it on a very like weird time.

**00:49:57** Right. Well, like this might be part of the reason why you've realized that this is

**00:50:02** the thing that you're not doing like everybody else because you have started

**00:50:08** to look at notes at a time when everyone is doing wikis.

**00:50:12** Right. Yeah.

**00:50:13** There is a big upending in the way that note applications are looked at.

**00:50:19** And it is this thing of like the Notion Nation.

**00:50:22** Yes. The Roman Rovers.

**00:50:25** No, I think the one I heard I liked best was the Roman Legion, which feels really

**00:50:30** obvious and I really like that.

**00:50:31** But there's a reason we because I also heard people say Roman Empire.

**00:50:34** We didn't come on that because we were going for a liberation of all of them.

**00:50:37** That's why we never got to any of the Roman ones.

**00:50:40** But I like Roman Legion.

**00:50:42** I like Roman Legion is good.

**00:50:43** So I'm notion nation is just funny and we don't have to alliterate everything

**00:50:47** because Roman Legion is excellent.

**00:50:49** OK, so I feel slightly less crazy with you mentioning this because I have,

**00:50:55** but feeling like, oh, I'm paying attention to notes.

**00:50:58** And so suddenly the whole world is paying attention to notes.

**00:51:01** It's like that's not how the world works, but apparently it is.

**00:51:04** And it is.

**00:51:07** So thank you for thank you for confirming that.

**00:51:10** Just just as I suspected, like the world around me.

**00:51:13** Get to know.

**00:51:14** Get to know.

**00:51:14** Quantum mechanics tells me like my pure

**00:51:17** attention creates the world as it is perfect.

**00:51:19** That's exactly what I thought.

**00:51:20** So anyway, I have been looking into the notes.

**00:51:23** There is this idea that's been going around in this discussion of notes that

**00:51:28** my attention has created, which I think encapsulates a clear idea.

**00:51:34** And it's this distinction between Evernote, Rome and Notion.

**00:51:39** And like what kind of person each of these apps are for.

**00:51:43** And the idea is Evernote is for librarians.

**00:51:47** Rome is for gardeners and Notion is for architects.

**00:51:53** And I've seen this like all over the place,

**00:51:55** this concept from people are trying to think about these different note systems.

**00:51:59** And I do think there's something really there's something really good about it,

**00:52:03** which is why it's an idea that's spreading.

**00:52:05** I think the gardener one is the one that's the most confusing to me.

**00:52:09** The other two are librarian and architect.

**00:52:11** I can kind of get around that, but I don't know why Notion is for gardeners.

**00:52:16** It's Rome is Rome is for gardeners.

**00:52:18** And Notion is for architects.

**00:52:19** OK, still hasn't helped.

**00:52:22** No, no, yes.

**00:52:23** Well, no.

**00:52:23** Well, but the gardeners want to get to that in a second.

**00:52:26** But as soon as I heard that, like, oh, this makes total sense.

**00:52:29** And yes, librarians makes perfect sense.

**00:52:32** Notion is something that's been incorporated into my workflow purely through my assistant.

**00:52:38** And it also is like, oh, this, of course, is this good tool for architecting

**00:52:44** like a more permanent structure around something like a company.

**00:52:48** Right. And procedures and checklists.

**00:52:50** And how do you do all of this?

**00:52:51** You know, it's it's why it's why Notion allows you to throw a database in the middle

**00:52:55** of your text file, like it's sort of leans in this direction of you want to build

**00:53:01** a beautiful cathedral that is complete about this topic.

**00:53:04** Like, that's the way that tool works.

**00:53:06** So the Rome is for gardeners.

**00:53:08** One like the reason this is confusing to you, Mike, is because I think the idea that

**00:53:13** this is trying to express is the same kind of idea in the Zettelkasten system

**00:53:19** that I was describing last time.

**00:53:21** You're not making the outline ahead of time.

**00:53:24** You don't know specifically what it is that you're building.

**00:53:28** And unlike a library, you're not trying to file things within a hierarchical Dewey

**00:53:34** Decimal system. You are having things grow and you're sort of tending to them as they

**00:53:41** grow. And the idea here is also like it's not a, you know, it's not not like an

**00:53:46** English garden where everything is like like sharply cut lines.

**00:53:50** It's more like, oh, this is like a wild managed garden and you are the person who's

**00:53:54** overseeing it. And that's like the idea in the Zettelkasten system.

**00:53:59** And that's also why it makes sense the way Rome does things is like, oh, OK,

**00:54:04** it's it is leaning you in this other direction of it's really easy to create

**00:54:11** notes. It's really easy to link notes to each

**00:54:14** other. The the focus is is like much less on the specific content of any particular

**00:54:21** note like notion does. And it's more about the relationships between them.

**00:54:26** And I just think like this is seems to me like a pretty good division in how do

**00:54:31** people work these three ideas and even the Gardner one being a little bit

**00:54:36** confusing to me seems like no, but that makes sense because if you are this sort

**00:54:41** of person, it just makes sense to you right away.

**00:54:45** And I think very clearly like, oh, I got attracted to Zettelkasten in the first

**00:54:50** place because the ideas that I originally came across related to it like this makes

**00:54:54** much more sense to me than any of the other two messages.

**00:54:58** So all of that is to say that Rome is obviously the tool that I should use.

**00:55:03** But I don't like it.

**00:55:05** And I don't like it either for reasons that are incredibly hard to pin down like

**00:55:11** I was trying to think about it before the show.

**00:55:13** I need to be able to put into words like why I don't like Rome.

**00:55:18** And I can come up with nothing specific that doesn't sound ridiculous.

**00:55:24** So I'll just say like this is the way life is sometimes.

**00:55:26** Sometimes you find yourself a little repelled from something and you just don't

**00:55:31** know why and it's OK to go with your gut sometimes.

**00:55:34** Let me throw in some of the reasons that I don't like at the moment.

**00:55:38** It might change one.

**00:55:39** And there's no apps, right?

**00:55:41** Yeah, not interested in that.

**00:55:43** And then because it's just for the web, like, and it's just on the web, it feels

**00:55:48** like it has absolutely zero personality because nothing is like it's just some

**00:55:53** web pages and you just go for it.

**00:55:55** It doesn't it doesn't feel like it has a personality of any kind.

**00:56:00** Maybe that's not important, probably not important.

**00:56:03** And I reckon I would maybe feel better

**00:56:05** about it if there was an app, but like it just I don't want to use a web page

**00:56:11** like to put my notes into I just don't want to do that.

**00:56:14** It's like one of the reasons I'm turned off of notion is right.

**00:56:17** Like it just feels like it's the web, even though it's an app.

**00:56:21** So like to be honest, I'm not sure that I would ever really be that interested in

**00:56:25** trying something like Rome, because even when they build an app, I expect it will

**00:56:29** just be a WebView inside of an application, especially when it comes to stuff like

**00:56:33** notes. There's like a security that I feel from it in that it being like a

**00:56:39** what feels like a native application.

**00:56:42** It just makes me feel more comfortable to trust my notes to that.

**00:56:46** That's why I like the notes app.

**00:56:48** I like bear. I don't really use bear for notes.

**00:56:50** I use it for like markdown for longer writing.

**00:56:53** But if I was going to not use the Apple

**00:56:56** Notes app, bear is the app I would use. Yeah.

**00:56:59** I mean, a bear is doing more and more stuff like this.

**00:57:01** By the way, you might want to look at it,

**00:57:03** Gray, for like connecting notes together.

**00:57:06** And they just introduced they've been doing this for a while where you can link

**00:57:09** from note to note, but now they've done it where you can link to sections of other

**00:57:15** notes. Yeah, I did see that.

**00:57:17** And again, it's just like because my attention has turned to this topic now.

**00:57:21** All right. I was like, oh, bear is doing this thing, too.

**00:57:24** But now I feel like I am in this, too,

**00:57:26** because like I think I would have previously just ignored that headline.

**00:57:29** But now I'm like, oh, notes, right?

**00:57:32** Even though I'm not doing what you're doing.

**00:57:34** But now my brain is tuned to every piece of notes news.

**00:57:40** Yeah. And and of course, we have now done this to the listeners where I think many

**00:57:44** of them will have never even come across a piece of notes news in forever.

**00:57:48** And like now every every every scrap of notes news is going to be

**00:57:53** blared into their attention because of this, especially anything noteworthy.

**00:58:00** Hmm.

**00:58:03** I'm glad you're pleased with yourself.

**00:58:05** Very so pleased.

**00:58:07** I thought scrap was like close enough

**00:58:09** without being a pun, but now you've got to kind of go one further.

**00:58:13** It wasn't cheesy enough for Greg.

**00:58:15** Come on. I want to.

**00:58:18** I will turn my attention back to Rome because I know they're building an app.

**00:58:22** And that's when I will give it much more of its due.

**00:58:25** I just know that there's no point in me trying to use it.

**00:58:29** Now, because it's just not the tool for me if it's on the web only.

**00:58:33** Yeah, because I like to write notes any time.

**00:58:38** I don't want to wait for an Internet connection.

**00:58:40** Mm hmm. That is like a very important thing for me.

**00:58:43** Like if this does not work offline, I can't trust it as my notes app because I

**00:58:47** want to retrieve and add that information without waiting, without delay, without fail.

**00:58:54** So I need to know that all of that content is available to me whenever I need it.

**00:58:59** And a web page is not that right.

**00:59:02** Like if I have something I want to write a note about, I need to write it right now.

**00:59:06** And it needs to go where it needs to go.

**00:59:08** That's why I trust Apple Notes.

**00:59:10** Right. Like it does that for me.

**00:59:11** The sink in is fantastic.

**00:59:12** The notes are always where I need them.

**00:59:15** You know, like you a note, Apple Notes

**00:59:17** database builds incredibly fast, like if I have a new machine,

**00:59:21** it's sinking my hundreds and hundreds of notes.

**00:59:23** Takes a couple of minutes.

**00:59:25** You know, like that's what I want.

**00:59:28** I don't want to be going out to the web every time.

**00:59:31** Yeah. Yeah.

**00:59:31** It doesn't feel reliable enough for me that way.

**00:59:33** Yeah. And like those are good.

**00:59:35** Those are good reasons.

**00:59:36** It's just a funny thing.

**00:59:37** It's like Rome is in this, the three big contenders for these kind of knowledge

**00:59:45** management systems. Evernote, Rome and Notion are the big

**00:59:48** players and Evernote is the dinosaur on the block and Rome and Notion are the new

**00:59:54** kids on the block. But they're very different in the way that they act.

**00:59:58** And of the three, it's very clear that like Rome is the tool that I should use,

**01:00:04** but I don't like it and I cannot specify why.

**01:00:08** But the flip side of that coin is that there is a tool that I shouldn't like,

**01:00:13** but I totally love.

**01:00:15** And that is Obsidian, which is the one I mentioned last time.

**01:00:19** I had been just investigating a little bit, but like, boy, oh boy, do I love Obsidian.

**01:00:25** And it is the reverse.

**01:00:27** Like I've got I've got a long list of things that I could tell you about why I

**01:00:31** shouldn't like Obsidian, but they don't matter because I just love it.

**01:00:35** While I was editing the episode before, I was looking at the website again and I was

**01:00:40** listening to your description and I tell you, Gray, I still do not understand what

**01:00:44** this application does.

**01:00:45** I was looking at the images that they put on the website.

**01:00:49** I was listening to you explaining to me for the second time.

**01:00:52** Well, I'm going, yeah, yeah.

**01:00:53** And I, Gray, I don't understand it.

**01:00:55** I don't know why there's graphs.

**01:00:57** I don't know where the notes actually are.

**01:01:00** Like I do not get it.

**01:01:02** I am pleased this one is interesting to you.

**01:01:04** But like, oh, it's not it's not interesting.

**01:01:07** Like I love it. Right.

**01:01:09** But like, let me tell you, I've got all these reasons why I shouldn't.

**01:01:12** Oh, it's an electron app.

**01:01:14** I hate electron apps.

**01:01:15** But you know what? Whatever.

**01:01:16** Like the programmers are doing an amazing job of making it feel like it's just a

**01:01:20** different tool and not a gross electron app.

**01:01:22** Looking at you, Slack.

**01:01:24** Right. So like, I don't I don't like that at all.

**01:01:26** It's a tiny development team.

**01:01:28** It's like two people.

**01:01:29** It's a brand new project.

**01:01:31** So like the very instant uncertainty is incredibly high.

**01:01:34** They don't even have any monetization in place right now.

**01:01:37** They've got a plan for like how they will monetize the app.

**01:01:41** But like they don't have it right now.

**01:01:43** All they have is an option to sign up and just give them some money to support the

**01:01:47** development, which I 100 percent did in exchange for nothing.

**01:01:51** Like, please keep building this app.

**01:01:53** I love it.

**01:01:54** Oh, it's Mac only.

**01:01:56** No iOS apps, no iPad apps.

**01:01:59** Probably never will be.

**01:02:00** I just assume never like it's on their really.

**01:02:03** They have a little Trello board for what's under development and like on the

**01:02:07** farthest end, they're like very long term, you know, mobile apps.

**01:02:11** But even there, they're all they're like long term projection is is just a lightweight

**01:02:16** one, you know, something for capture and for access.

**01:02:19** But they're not even like they're not even dreaming that they're going to

**01:02:22** recreate the whole thing on iOS.

**01:02:24** What an incredible downside.

**01:02:26** I don't care. I love it.

**01:02:27** I've been playing around with it and it's just very obvious that of all of the

**01:02:31** digital tools, this is the one that just suits my brain the best.

**01:02:36** And.

**01:02:38** Yeah, it's you know, you can do the kind of Zetal cast and sort of thing.

**01:02:43** I think probably one of the clearest things I can say that is a function of why

**01:02:46** do I like it is it's very easy to open up a bunch of little windows.

**01:02:54** So I'm really trying to recreate this idea of all the notes are sort of index

**01:03:00** card sized. And if you think that these are like these aren't endless scrolling

**01:03:05** text documents, these are index card size pieces of information.

**01:03:09** Well, you can fit a lot of index cards on an IMAX screen and Obsidian makes it

**01:03:14** really easy to do that.

**01:03:16** Like every time you command click on a link in one of your notes,

**01:03:20** it'll just open up in a new window and like fit it somewhere on the screen.

**01:03:24** So it's a great way to be able to look at like a bunch of stuff at once.

**01:03:27** It really is very Linuxy, but in the good way, not in the way that Linux can be

**01:03:33** terrible. So, yeah, I would say I really like Obsidian and for my own total

**01:03:40** self-interest, anyone who's tried Rome and has felt like they don't quite like

**01:03:45** it, give Obsidian a try because I would like them to get a bigger user base and

**01:03:50** then to be able to have a monetization plan so that it continues to exist.

**01:03:55** But, yeah, so that that is where I have fallen on the digital tool side.

**01:03:58** Obsidian, the app that I shouldn't love, but I really do.

**01:04:04** Oh, they also have an 80s theme, which is totally rad.

**01:04:11** OK.

**01:05:59** You mentioned paint in your office blue.

**01:06:02** What else is going on in your quarantine time?

**01:06:06** Well,

**01:06:08** I mean, I would say this has.

**01:06:13** Without a doubt, been the most boring and uneventful time of my life.

**01:06:23** Yeah, but I've also just loved it.

**01:06:25** Like I've just loved every minute of it.

**01:06:27** Boring doesn't have to be bad.

**01:06:28** It depends on how you call it what you're saying, right?

**01:06:30** It's boring in the sense that like you haven't gone anywhere.

**01:06:34** Yeah, it's boring.

**01:06:36** In the sense that I painted my office blue is legitimately one of the biggest

**01:06:43** pieces of news I can present to you in my life.

**01:06:46** Right.

**01:06:46** Like what has happened?

**01:06:48** Like my office is blue.

**01:06:50** And this like if we're making a list of here's the top three most interesting

**01:06:53** things that have happened to Gray in the past many months, like that easily makes

**01:06:57** the top three list. That's that's what I mean by boring.

**01:07:01** Right. I like it.

**01:07:02** I like boring.

**01:07:03** And I I was just looking at my calendar the other day and I realized I passed my

**01:07:09** what I'm thinking of as my six month quarantine aversary because I was looking

**01:07:15** at my calendar and it occurred to me, I was like, oh, what was the last

**01:07:21** social event that I did in person?

**01:07:25** And I realized, yeah, that was that was more than six months ago.

**01:07:29** Now was the last time I socialized with a human being in person.

**01:07:33** And so, yeah, it's like, oh, it's quite a while ago, but it's been great.

**01:07:38** So, yeah, very low key quarantine, but it's nice.

**01:07:43** I mean, do you feel the same way?

**01:07:44** Do you feel like your life has no events?

**01:07:46** Different events, different events.

**01:07:49** What do you mean by different events?

**01:07:50** Well, I mean, I still have things going on.

**01:07:52** Right. Podcast is on.

**01:07:53** It's happening.

**01:07:54** You know, right.

**01:07:55** We're getting into new phone season.

**01:07:59** These are things that always happen anyway.

**01:08:02** I have had that period of time up until now

**01:08:07** because things that typically happen for me between March and September

**01:08:13** call for lots of events that are only really occurring in person.

**01:08:18** But this time of year, kind of September to December,

**01:08:21** there's a lot of stuff happening for me, which always happen the way that I'm doing

**01:08:26** them.

**01:08:27** So it feels like I'm getting a little bit of normalcy there.

**01:08:32** Right. Like new iPhones, multiple product releases of different like all that kind

**01:08:37** of stuff. I always did that at home. Right.

**01:08:38** So like, right, those feel like normal.

**01:08:41** And also like our quarantine is different in that I have my studio.

**01:08:48** Right. So I'm leaving the house.

**01:08:49** I'm going to a place every day.

**01:08:51** I'm here basically every work day now, by the way.

**01:08:54** Oh, that's great. Yeah, really good.

**01:08:56** I have a commute again, which is interesting.

**01:08:58** I actually like it because it's a bit more activity.

**01:09:02** I can get work done on the commute.

**01:09:04** I like I'm like I'm finding all of the things that can be good about a commute.

**01:09:08** There are bad things about commutes.

**01:09:10** Sure. Like I have a travel card again.

**01:09:13** Right. Like this is a weird thing.

**01:09:16** It's been six years since I had a travel card.

**01:09:20** I kind of hate that I have to use the physical

**01:09:23** oyster card that like TFO have not found a way to make a digital oyster card in my

**01:09:27** phone, which they could totally do it.

**01:09:29** They wanted to.

**01:09:30** Why don't you just use the contactless credit card thing?

**01:09:33** Because it's more expensive.

**01:09:35** I thought I thought it retroactively gave you the discount after you traveled.

**01:09:39** Yes, kind of.

**01:09:41** But also if you're going to make it a business expense,

**01:09:45** it's way easier to pay for it in a chunk than for me to be saving.

**01:09:49** Because TFO doesn't generate receipts.

**01:09:51** Right. But I can get a receipt of a travel

**01:09:53** card. Yes. Okay.

**01:09:54** I got it. That makes sense.

**01:09:56** That is right. Now I'm like with this freaking oyster card

**01:09:59** in my wallet, like a chump, taking it out every day.

**01:10:02** That also feels like a real relic.

**01:10:04** I'm trying to think how long it's been since I've had a physical oyster card.

**01:10:08** Like, oh, I was a child who had just arrived in the city.

**01:10:11** For me, it has been six years, six years since I had an oyster card.

**01:10:17** So I'm back on that again.

**01:10:19** But that's kind of what it is.

**01:10:21** I have a pretty good like 11 to seven routine.

**01:10:25** It's pretty standard for me.

**01:10:27** Like I don't typically get into the office before 10,

**01:10:31** which just fits with my routine and also means that I'm definitely not around any

**01:10:37** of the busy times of travel and for my route.

**01:10:41** Super chill every day.

**01:10:42** There's barely anyone on the trains.

**01:10:44** I can stay within good distance.

**01:10:46** Like that feels I've not been concerned about that.

**01:10:50** I did get a bag.

**01:10:51** OK, for your travel back and forth.

**01:10:53** What bag did you get?

**01:10:55** I got a bag called the Bellroy tote pack, which you listening for Texans.

**01:10:59** My remember as I brought this bag up once before back when Mega Studio was new

**01:11:04** and you really talked me out of getting a new bag.

**01:11:08** Yes. Yes.

**01:11:09** But frankly, there isn't a situation right now where I can leave things here.

**01:11:15** Right. That's the things that I need to be

**01:11:17** at home and here because I can't leave things here safely.

**01:11:22** OK, OK, that's right.

**01:11:23** Because immediate lockdown can occur at any point.

**01:11:27** And I have been proven in that fact because I had to self isolate last week.

**01:11:32** So last weekend, I didn't feel too well.

**01:11:35** OK, right. Like I was just feeling under the weather.

**01:11:38** So no reason to be paranoid.

**01:11:40** Could just be a cold.

**01:11:42** Could just be a cold.

**01:11:43** But like you get any symptom now and you're like, well,

**01:11:46** I better check. So I got a covid test.

**01:11:49** How was the covid test? I've heard the terrible.

**01:11:51** So I found it OK because people told me about it was OK.

**01:11:57** So this is different in different countries around the world.

**01:12:00** But in the UK, it's not very difficult to get tested.

**01:12:03** It's trickier right now.

**01:12:04** But like the mechanics of it aren't too bad.

**01:12:06** We just went online, I filled in a form.

**01:12:08** They mailed me a test.

**01:12:10** The tests that are delivered by Amazon, which is like this weird,

**01:12:13** dystopian, but convenient thing.

**01:12:16** That is really weird.

**01:12:17** That does very much feel like the movie where it's the corporate future.

**01:12:22** You know, everything is brought to you by Amazon, even even your government covid test.

**01:12:27** It's very by and large, right, because in WALL-E, the president of by and large

**01:12:32** is the president, right?

**01:12:34** You know, it's very close to that.

**01:12:36** But honestly, was convenient.

**01:12:38** Right. Like it was on Sunday.

**01:12:40** Right.

**01:12:42** And then so we took the test.

**01:12:44** I mean, so if you don't know,

**01:12:46** the thing about the covid testing is here in the UK, if you have a car,

**01:12:51** you can drive to a drive thru and someone will administer the test to you.

**01:12:55** Oh, yeah. But if you don't have a car, the best way to do it is they send you

**01:12:59** the test, but that means you do the test yourself and the instructions are like,

**01:13:04** OK, you have to take the swab, you have to rub it on the tonsils, on your tonsils.

**01:13:10** Do not touch your tongue.

**01:13:11** Do not touch your cheek.

**01:13:13** And it's like, is that even possible?

**01:13:16** Yeah, I don't think I could do that.

**01:13:18** I did it.

**01:13:20** I did do it.

**01:13:22** Both me and Idina did it and we didn't touch our tongues.

**01:13:25** It takes a lot of practice, like looking

**01:13:27** in the mirror and opening your mouth and being like, how do I need to open my mouth

**01:13:32** in such a way that I can see a clear path to my tonsils without touching my tongue?

**01:13:37** And like, Idina was doing it by saying, ah, that worked for her.

**01:13:41** And I could just do it by just being like very like just paying attention.

**01:13:46** This is like a game of operation.

**01:13:47** That's what you're playing.

**01:13:48** And also, yeah, staying calm, too.

**01:13:50** Right. Like you got to be calm because it makes you want to gag.

**01:13:55** Right. But if you do that, your tongue moves, you stay really calm.

**01:13:58** Now, my brother had done one a few weeks ago and he had really hyped it up to me as

**01:14:04** like, this is terrible. So going into it, I thought it was going to be really

**01:14:07** terrible. And really, it just ended up being kind of uncomfortable.

**01:14:11** But because the other thing is you then take that same swab and stick it up your

**01:14:15** nose, which is so weird.

**01:14:17** And you and as the instructions say, you keep pushing until you feel resistance.

**01:14:22** So that thing just goes up in there, Gray.

**01:14:26** It just goes up in and you turn it around, take it out, stick it up.

**01:14:29** The other one, it's like it is it's a very like.

**01:14:36** Brutal in like a like brutalist type

**01:14:38** thing to do to yourself, like to administer this test to yourself in your own bathroom.

**01:14:43** It's very strange.

**01:14:44** But I'm happy that we have access to testing. Right.

**01:14:48** Yeah. Yeah. I mean, of course, of course you want access.

**01:14:51** Yes. Granted. But it's still super freaking weird.

**01:14:55** But, you know, unfortunately, it took us a little longer.

**01:14:58** Like in the in previous weeks, it's been pretty quick.

**01:15:01** But we had unfortunately hit we took our test in a week where there was a bank

**01:15:05** holiday, so there was one last day of processing and then also a week where for

**01:15:09** some reason there was just lots more people testing themselves.

**01:15:13** And it seemed like the testing centers were overrun.

**01:15:15** So we sent our tests off on Tuesday, which is so weird because you put it in the post box.

**01:15:21** Right. I know that they're in tubes and in bags,

**01:15:24** but like you see the boxes and you're like, oh, no, right.

**01:15:27** I can imagine as a postal worker.

**01:15:29** Right. It's like, yeah, just like very strange.

**01:15:32** Right. Like anyway.

**01:15:34** So then it goes off and you get a text

**01:15:36** and an email and they're like, you're negative, but we didn't get that until Saturday evening.

**01:15:43** So I was home from Saturday to Saturday.

**01:15:46** And let me tell you, I do not want to go

**01:15:48** into lockdown again because I have gotten used to having an office now.

**01:15:51** OK, so having tasted the freedom of the office.

**01:15:54** Yeah. The lockdown with the lockdown was much more brutal.

**01:15:58** Much worse. Yeah.

**01:16:00** Because I couldn't prepare properly.

**01:16:01** Right. Because it just happened.

**01:16:04** You know, like so there was stuff in the studio that I would have liked to have at home and didn't.

**01:16:10** One thing that we did do was really I think this was spurred on by what was happening

**01:16:15** in the grey household, we really tidied out mega office.

**01:16:20** So by the end of our isolation, it did feel nicer to be working in there

**01:16:24** because I wasn't surrounded by mountains of boxes.

**01:16:28** And that was the only thing that I described.

**01:16:30** So it did feel better.

**01:16:32** And now like I feel like, OK, I actually do need to put some effort

**01:16:36** into mega office for the time being in case we have to go back.

**01:16:40** Right. But I'm so happy to be back in the studio again.

**01:16:44** But this is also like, why am I a week behind

**01:16:47** on physical podcast with on prep because we lost a week at the studio.

**01:16:51** Right. Of course, of course.

**01:16:53** That makes sense.

**01:16:54** So we could we would have been a little bit

**01:16:56** with some of the set up, so I'm having to do a bit of catch up on that.

**01:17:00** But yes, so that's my quarantine.

**01:17:02** I'm loving the studio, dreading lockdown.

**01:17:05** And you tested negative.

**01:17:06** You oh, yeah, yeah, of course.

**01:17:07** I mean, of course, I said negative.

**01:17:08** I'm back out in the world again.

**01:17:10** Although basically like by the time I got my test back,

**01:17:13** I was only two days away from being allowed to go outside again anyway

**01:17:17** because the current isolation time is 10 days.

**01:17:21** Right. So I mean, I guess I guess in theory,

**01:17:24** in this circumstance, you would have actually wanted to test positive and just

**01:17:28** stay home for two more days and then like, you know, if it's possible to benefit

**01:17:32** from antibodies, I would make the benefit. Right.

**01:17:35** Right. But like the frustrating thing was I felt basically normal after three days,

**01:17:40** but then couldn't go anywhere. Right.

**01:17:42** Because you don't know.

**01:17:43** And then I'm a fool, right?

**01:17:44** Like I've got I've waiting on a test result.

**01:17:46** Like if it turns out, you know, like you don't want to be that person.

**01:17:49** You shouldn't be that person.

**01:17:51** And I got a test pending.

**01:17:52** I've got to wait for the answer of the test before I go back outside again.

**01:17:56** Right. Yeah. Yeah.

**01:17:57** Yeah. Yeah.

**01:17:58** You don't you don't want to be the start of a new little cluster.

**01:18:01** Yeah. We'll be known as the Hurley cluster.

**01:18:04** In London is a new cluster.

**01:18:06** That's the Hurley cluster.

**01:18:07** This guy was commuting to work every day, even when he had a test pending.

**01:18:11** What an idiot.

**01:18:13** So, yeah, that's quarantine.

**01:18:15** Boring life is the best life, Mike.

**01:18:16** I mean, it is a life.

**01:18:18** You can get used to that.

**01:18:19** I feel like I'm used to it.

**01:18:22** Yeah. Maybe a better word is placid.

**01:18:25** Like what a placid, enjoyable stretch of time I've had is it was on my mind just

**01:18:30** because I can start to I sort of mentioned this in the video,

**01:18:35** but like I'm just feeling the beginnings of like the cracks of social pressure

**01:18:41** coming back into my life and, you know, again, it's this it's this difficulty

**01:18:47** of making decisions about what are and what are not acceptable risks.

**01:18:52** But I'm feeling more aware of like this interregnum is coming to an end at some

**01:18:58** point, and that's why it like it struck me as curious, like, I wonder how long it

**01:19:03** has been since I've seen someone in person, not my wife.

**01:19:06** And like, oh, yeah, it's six months.

**01:19:08** And yeah, I just I don't know.

**01:19:10** Like, I don't know when that first real

**01:19:12** break is going to happen, but it just it can feel a lot of the world

**01:19:17** like spinning back up and invitations and social pressures kind of

**01:19:22** coming back in and but I mean, yes, they are occurring more,

**01:19:28** but I do feel like it's easier to say no than before.

**01:19:31** You can just say, no, where are I selling?

**01:19:34** Yes. Right.

**01:19:35** And I think most people do that.

**01:19:39** OK, right.

**01:19:40** Like in the same way that like I have seen some friends and we're taking all

**01:19:45** of the recommended precautions, but like it's pretty you know, it's like

**01:19:49** it was like we're not like touching in any way.

**01:19:52** Right. Nothing. Right.

**01:19:54** Like no hugs, no nothing.

**01:19:55** And it's like I'm keeping my family still.

**01:19:57** Like I've seen some family, but like there is no physical contact.

**01:20:01** Right. It's just like and my personal result on that is everyone's like, OK.

**01:20:06** Like, yeah, yeah.

**01:20:08** Yeah. Don't get me wrong.

**01:20:09** I'm not getting messages that are like get in the car, loser.

**01:20:12** We're going shopping. Right. Like,

**01:20:14** share this ice cream with me, Greg. Yeah, exactly.

**01:20:18** There's none of that kind of stuff.

**01:20:19** But it's it's just I'm aware of like an exponential increase in the number of like,

**01:20:25** oh, come to this thing or like go over here.

**01:20:28** And it's like, oh, please, no, I don't want to.

**01:20:30** No, no one has has had even the slightest hint of a negative response.

**01:20:36** Right. But it's still like,

**01:20:39** again, it's just it's the difficulty of making these decisions and these like

**01:20:44** these risk calculations and trying to think about.

**01:20:49** When are sensible points to reevaluate?

**01:20:53** And I think one of the other things that's just on my mind is I've been aware that

**01:20:57** in the beginning, my wife and I kept having like a really clear reevaluation schedule,

**01:21:04** you know, so it was like, OK, maybe there is a global pandemic coming.

**01:21:08** We're going to go into lockdown for two weeks and then we'll see what the deal is.

**01:21:12** And that was like, oh, God, this looks really bad.

**01:21:16** We'll check back in in a month.

**01:21:18** Oh, it's worse than worst case scenario.

**01:21:21** Oh, yeah.

**01:21:22** Like at one point, I remember we had we will reevaluate on Independence Day.

**01:21:28** Like American Freedom Day will be the day that we leave our quarantine.

**01:21:32** You know, and then that that reevaluation day came and it was like, nope,

**01:21:37** this is not happening.

**01:21:38** I remember in March thinking maybe I can go to the Atlanta Penn show in April.

**01:21:45** Right. Also like in April thinking maybe I can be in Memphis for the podcast.

**01:21:50** It's on. Yeah.

**01:21:51** These were all things where it's like, surely it will be taken care of by then.

**01:21:56** Yeah, exactly.

**01:21:57** But then at some point after Independence Day and I don't know exactly when we ever

**01:22:03** really set a reevaluation point.

**01:22:06** Yeah. You know, it's just like, I guess this is the thing now.

**01:22:11** And I think it is good to have dates to set as reevaluation points.

**01:22:17** I do think that was the only time in this whole period where my wife and I were like

**01:22:22** drifting a little bit.

**01:22:23** It's because we just hadn't said, like, when do we reevaluate it?

**01:22:27** But now my wife's been looking at like expert advice and, you know, she's looking

**01:22:33** at, oh, okay, end of 2021 is like maybe this is the reevaluation point.

**01:22:38** Who knows?

**01:22:39** It's just like just to have something in your mind.

**01:22:41** I am maintaining right as I should be, like, being very aware, being very

**01:22:45** vigilant, all that kind of stuff.

**01:22:47** Right. Which is my preface to saying that I am

**01:22:50** finding myself thinking much more like looking around, seeing what's happening in

**01:22:55** the world, seeing the way that retail is opening and dining, you know,

**01:23:00** like just looking and thinking to myself, you know what, like.

**01:23:05** This is it, right?

**01:23:07** Like, this is how we're going to be for some time.

**01:23:11** And there is a.

**01:23:15** Set of balances that as a society, if we're functioning properly, we can try and do

**01:23:22** and as individuals, we can do and I'm basically like.

**01:23:28** I'm not getting upset anymore.

**01:23:30** I'm not freaking out anymore.

**01:23:32** I'm kind of just like, all right, like I'm in it.

**01:23:36** We're in it and we'll just keep going until we're not.

**01:23:40** Yeah, no, yeah, don't give me that.

**01:23:42** There's no saying you're not saying it.

**01:23:43** It's like it's a similar thing.

**01:23:45** We're like, I don't I don't feel like I need like like you both did.

**01:23:49** Like, I don't feel like I need this sense of like, well, maybe in a couple of months

**01:23:53** it will be taken care of.

**01:23:54** I'm kind of just like.

**01:23:57** All right, like I'm in it now and and I'm just going to try and find life within

**01:24:03** these parameters and just get used to it because if I don't do that,

**01:24:08** I don't know what how else I'm going to feel like this is just where I am.

**01:24:13** Oh, yeah, yeah.

**01:24:14** And it makes sense, you know, and it's also

**01:24:18** again, it's just trying to figure out where to set the dial with these things.

**01:24:24** The only thing that I have found genuinely frustrating is just like the not the

**01:24:30** inability to travel and that and that's part of what the big like

**01:24:35** reevaluation point is as well as like, OK, when is the next time that if something

**01:24:41** came up that's interesting for a project, I would feel comfortable getting on an

**01:24:45** airplane to go investigate that project, that's that's a question.

**01:24:50** And then, you know, and then the other

**01:24:52** question on the so that's like one big one.

**01:24:54** And that does feel like the 2021 reevaluation.

**01:24:59** Yeah, you know, but then on a much on a much smaller scale, there's there's just

**01:25:03** the question of like, I've never gone this long without some kind of

**01:25:08** vacation or without being on my own.

**01:25:11** And, you know, it's just it's a funny thing.

**01:25:13** It's like, oh, losing all the socializing.

**01:25:15** No problem.

**01:25:16** But not having a period of time where I'm just actually completely isolated.

**01:25:24** Yeah. Like, boy, it's been been a long time

**01:25:26** since that. And, you know, my my wife was looking at me the other day.

**01:25:30** She's usually the one who initiates this, where she's like.

**01:25:34** You look like you could need a vacation.

**01:25:36** And it's like, OK, how do we evaluate that as a risk?

**01:25:40** I have no idea.

**01:25:41** Like, I just haven't even really thought it through.

**01:25:44** But those are the sorts of things we're just trying to think like,

**01:25:46** what are the tradeoffs here?

**01:25:48** You know, what's what is being too cautious?

**01:25:50** What is possibly being not cautious enough?

**01:25:52** Like, it's it's still extremely hard to judge.

**01:25:57** And it is in part of this feeling that, like, I think the vast majority of the world

**01:26:03** is basically where you are, like, of like, yeah, this is OK.

**01:26:07** This is the way things are, you know, for some indefinite period of time.

**01:26:12** And people are like getting on with their lives.

**01:26:14** I think that's the way most of the world is.

**01:26:17** So, yeah, it's just it's just thinking about things in those contexts.

**01:26:21** But that's partly why I just I feel like there's some some kind of cracks coming.

**01:26:27** And I just I don't know what the first thing to crack will be.

**01:26:31** Like, maybe my wife will find some totally isolated place to dump me for two weeks,

**01:26:36** you know, for like a vacation and that will represent the first kind of

**01:26:40** quarantine break. Like, I just don't know.

**01:26:42** I just don't know what's what the situation is going to be.

**01:26:44** We have a couple of staycations coming up.

**01:26:47** We have a family event and then we're doing something for a day's birthday.

**01:26:52** So what are you what are you doing in terms of the physicalness of it?

**01:26:55** What does that mean?

**01:26:56** Like, is the family getting together?

**01:26:59** Are you going to some place and staying overnight?

**01:27:01** We're going to a place for a few days.

**01:27:03** Like, we're all going to a place for a few days if it goes well.

**01:27:06** And it all works out.

**01:27:08** And everyone has fun.

**01:27:09** Like, I can imagine me and I didn't do more of that stuff throughout the rest of the year.

**01:27:12** You know, finding a hotel just to change the scenery.

**01:27:16** Yeah. Yeah.

**01:27:18** And even with that, I have been more in the outside world lately, like the physical

**01:27:23** outside space. Okay.

**01:27:24** I do have a question.

**01:27:26** I have a question, a feedback question for the audience.

**01:27:29** Okay. So some masks, right?

**01:27:32** Everybody's wearing them.

**01:27:34** I think my face is too big for a mask.

**01:27:39** Like, okay.

**01:27:41** I cannot find a mask that seems to fit.

**01:27:45** It's like the distance between the top of my nose and the bottom of my chin is too

**01:27:52** large. All right.

**01:27:53** I was having this problem.

**01:27:55** Okay.

**01:27:56** I'm going to send you a link.

**01:27:58** You're not going to like it.

**01:27:59** I'm going to send you a link.

**01:28:00** I feel like I'm not going to like it, Mike.

**01:28:03** Adidas make masks.

**01:28:05** Okay.

**01:28:06** I mean, I have an Adidas logo on them.

**01:28:07** I don't know how you feel about that.

**01:28:08** That's what I think that you might not like.

**01:28:10** These are my favorites.

**01:28:12** These are my favorites.

**01:28:13** They're made.

**01:28:14** They're not.

**01:28:15** It's difficult to explain what they're made from, but they're kind of like they

**01:28:20** feel like a little spongy in a way. Okay.

**01:28:23** Get a pack of these.

**01:28:25** They have the medium and large, like they have small, medium, medium, large, right?

**01:28:29** Two sizes.

**01:28:30** Get the medium large is 15 pounds for three pack.

**01:28:34** These are my favorites.

**01:28:35** They fit me the best.

**01:28:37** I was having this problem too of like that.

**01:28:40** I cannot find I could not find many options that would cover my nose to all

**01:28:45** the way under my chin. These do that.

**01:28:47** I really like them.

**01:28:49** Yeah.

**01:28:49** Or like I would find something that would

**01:28:51** cover until I would open my mouth at all and then it would just it would come and

**01:28:56** not work. I mean, okay.

**01:28:57** If you can do I've been able to do a bit

**01:29:01** of talking, but if I talk for a bit, it will slip off.

**01:29:04** But I think that you'll never find an option.

**01:29:07** No, I'm going to find an option.

**01:29:08** And this is the reason why I'm asking the audience like, hey, listen,

**01:29:12** there's got to be someone else out there whose face is too big,

**01:29:15** but who also wants like an N95 mask to protect them from all the things.

**01:29:20** All right. Well, I can't help you with because these added us ones are just

**01:29:25** cloth coverings, right? Yes.

**01:29:27** No, I can I can see that I'll take them.

**01:29:28** I'll take them over nothing.

**01:29:29** Right. Like if something just.

**01:29:31** I mean, it has it has a pocket for a filter.

**01:29:33** So, you know, you can go wild.

**01:29:35** Get those and see.

**01:29:36** But OK, you are asking for this feedback.

**01:29:39** How will you how are you aiming to collect it?

**01:29:42** Where do you want the read it?

**01:29:43** And people go into the go into the read it.

**01:29:44** That's the way to do it. There's no one home on Twitter.

**01:29:46** Just send stuff to the Reddit.

**01:29:47** OK, that's that's the best way to find stuff.

**01:29:49** Well, that's why I wanted to make it very

**01:29:51** clear, because there's two things that I don't want to happen, which is I don't

**01:29:54** want to feel tweets or get emails. Right.

**01:29:57** Yeah. Yeah. Don't send stuff to Mike.

**01:29:58** That'd be terrible.

**01:29:59** It doesn't happen to me very often.

**01:30:01** But like if you ask something specific like this, I know I'm going to get caught

**01:30:04** up in it. Yeah, that's that's my request.

**01:30:06** OK, I mean, I will happily benefit from this crowdsourcing because I'm always

**01:30:12** on the lookout for new masks. The Adidas ones are the ones that I have liked the

**01:30:16** most, but they are far from perfect.

**01:30:19** Yeah, I hate the logo.

**01:30:21** It's ugly.

**01:30:22** I mean, look, what I what I really want is a Cortex brand mask.

**01:30:27** That's the thing that I actually want.

**01:30:28** Yeah, it doesn't exist.

**01:30:29** It doesn't exist.

**01:30:30** Look, this is not for a lack of trying on my part.

**01:30:33** Right. But this is the thing to get right.

**01:30:36** It seems to be pretty tricky.

**01:30:37** So yes, but that's but that's what I would like to bring into the world is the

**01:30:40** Cortex brand mask, but it doesn't exist.

**01:30:42** So in the meantime, help me out, Cortexons.

**01:30:45** Feedback in the Reddit.
