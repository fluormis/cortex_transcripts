# Cortex - 103: A New Widgety World
**00:00:00** This is not our usual WWDC episode, not in person this time.

**00:00:05** Well, I mean, we don't always record in person at WWDC.

**00:00:09** We only didn't record in person once, and then I think we recorded in person three times after that in the same room.

**00:00:15** But the tables may turn from here on out, Mike.

**00:00:18** Yeah.

**00:00:19** We may eventually have more non-in-person WWDC episodes than in-person WWDC episodes, depending on how this goes.

**00:00:28** Yeah, we'll see. I mean, like, there is a possibility that maybe in a year's time, I just come over and we watch the keynote together and we record straight after.

**00:00:35** That'd be fun, right? That doesn't sound like fun to me, actually.

**00:00:37** Wait, no, wait. Did you just invite yourself over? That's not what I mentioned.

**00:00:42** Yeah.

**00:00:42** No, no, no, no, no. Backing up, backing up, backing up.

**00:00:46** I'll bring the popcorn. It'll be nice.

**00:00:48** We'll see. We'll see how it goes. But no, we're not recording in person this time.

**00:00:52** But I assume that since WWDC is an entirely online, remote experience this year, it's probably been a much easier week for you than normal, right?

**00:01:04** You just get to chill out at home.

**00:01:06** No.

**00:01:06** Check in every once in a while. See what's up. This WWDC week, almost certainly this is your easy week, right? With Cortex as well, it's the easy week?

**00:01:15** I don't think I could have foreseen that a conference which I'm not attending could make me more tired than a conference that I'm actually attending.

**00:01:27** That's exhausting because attending conferences is the most exhausting thing in working life.

**00:01:32** Yeah.

**00:01:32** So please explain how is not attending WWDC more exhausting than attending WWDC?

**00:01:41** So there are a couple of areas here. I think I can split this into two kind of flows for why I am so tired.

**00:01:48** Okay.

**00:01:49** One is Apple is a California company, so everything's happening on California time.

**00:01:55** The worst time.

**00:01:56** Yes, the worst time. It's the worst time for everybody except people that live in California. Other than that, it's inconvenient for everyone.

**00:02:02** I do think that is literally true.

**00:02:04** So every day they publish a selection of videos, their session videos.

**00:02:08** If they publish these on Eastern time, it would be way nicer because I would get them at like three o'clock in the afternoon rather than six o'clock in the evening, right?

**00:02:17** So that's been one part is like the time shifting of everything has made things a little bit more tricky than usual.

**00:02:24** And then there is the element of things that I have not done very well for myself, which is when I go to WWDC,

**00:02:35** I do not record all of my usual podcasts. I will prerecord some of them or skip episodes or whatever.

**00:02:42** I didn't do that for this conference because I thought I'm at home. I don't need to move the pan addict. I'll just do it on Wednesday. No problem.

**00:02:50** Oh, okay.

**00:02:52** Because I'm not away. I didn't plan my week as if I was away.

**00:02:58** Yes. Yeah. Okay. I can see now. Yeah, this is very like I have made a huge mistake.

**00:03:05** Yes.

**00:03:07** All right. I can see why you would have thought that and that is a terrible decision.

**00:03:10** I just it never even really crossed my mind to think about moving things because what I wasn't for seeing is the fact that I've ended up with additional recordings put into my diary this week.

**00:03:22** So in a five day period, I am recording nine podcasts.

**00:03:26** Oh, my God.

**00:03:27** So I'm nearly at the end now. I have two more after this one to do. Okay.

**00:03:34** More recording, more editing than normal. And then the other part of it all is there's so much information coming out.

**00:03:42** And because I'm not at the conference, I'm not receiving information by osmosis in the way that I usually would, which is just every conversation is about what's happening.

**00:03:53** But also, I kind of feel this different responsibility to be more informed this year because all I have is time to consume the information and to try out the operating system and all that kind of stuff.

**00:04:11** So I feel like I am spending 13, 14 hours a day either consuming the WC related content or producing shows around it.

**00:04:25** So again, I love to consume all of that stuff and I want to because I'm as interested in it personally as I am professionally.

**00:04:34** But it just has resulted in the unexpected phenomenon of being more tired at WWDC at home than I am at WWDC in California.

**00:04:45** Yeah, I can see that because the fun thing about WWDC in person is also the thing that is one of the reasons, especially for you to go, is that when you're there, you get to talk to people who know things or there's tons of developers who are

**00:05:04** installing the new system on their devices and pointing things out.

**00:05:09** And there's this interesting asymmetry of information where people who are following it online sometimes have more of a like, oh, we know all of the features.

**00:05:19** But by being there in person, you can pick up some of the details or the way things are intended to be used in a way that's not obvious if you're just reading all of the reports and things.

**00:05:31** It's also the discussion. So like the reason people listen to podcasts produced like this one about stuff happening at WWDC is to hear people's opinions, to hear people's interpretations, what they like, what they don't like.

**00:05:45** And it's way harder for me to get that type of input this year because there are no lunch conversations or conversations happening in the bar.

**00:05:55** So like I'm having to do way more than usual to just gather all of my own original opinions on these things rather than hearing somebody say something.

**00:06:06** And I was like, well, why is that? What makes you feel that way and getting the information that way?

**00:06:10** So it's just a lot more research and I'm putting more. I've definitely put more pressure on myself this year to get that information as well.

**00:06:22** Like last year, I was really disconnected from iOS 13. I felt like I really didn't get to grips with it.

**00:06:30** And that really frustrated me, like that there was a lot of features that I kind of didn't really try out the way that I would have wanted to.

**00:06:37** And I just didn't put the same level of focus on it that I would have normally. So this year, I also feel like I don't want to repeat that again.

**00:06:44** And I want to be really testing everything out and trying it out from the get go as well.

**00:06:49** So there's a lot kind of going on this year, which is contributing to being very tired.

**00:06:56** Like we're going to talk about the whole WWDC thing, but I'm just I'm just curious as a preview, are you running the beta on any of your devices?

**00:07:03** Yeah. All right. Mike's doing the real legwork.

**00:07:05** I put it on on Tuesday on my iPad. Keynote was on Monday. I only didn't put it on a Monday because I was super busy Monday evening recording the upgrade.

**00:07:16** Right. And so day one, podcasts got to go out. Podcasts going to be done drinking a Red Bull at 10 p.m.

**00:07:24** Oh, right. So like that's where I am.

**00:07:28** Right. That's awful. I've done that late night coffee thing a few times.

**00:07:34** And you've created such a visceral feeling in me of the like, oh, I'm over caffeinated and tired and it's awful.

**00:07:43** And it just it f***s me up the next day. Yeah.

**00:07:47** I just feel like trash because like our eating schedule is all off because I'm working in the evenings.

**00:07:53** So we eat dinner at lunchtime like it's great. It's crazy. It's crazy here.

**00:07:59** Like I will say Adina has been an incredible support for me this week.

**00:08:03** She created like a little snack bar in the hallway, which I've been dealing with as I'm just going from living room to office to bathroom and back.

**00:08:12** And like that has been my 12 hour, 13 hour stints for the last four days.

**00:08:18** It's been very intense. But the thing is, this is the first time I've experienced this right for as long as I have been covering WWDC intensely.

**00:08:28** I've been attending. I had been in six years, seven years, something like that.

**00:08:33** And so I am very used to only really having to professionally report on one conference.

**00:08:42** And I'm used to doing that like in my first couple of years, I did it all wrong. Right.

**00:08:48** And like way over committed myself and ended up learning over time.

**00:08:52** Like what is the right balance for how I approach covering a conference while at the conference?

**00:08:59** This is the first time I've tried to cover a week long conference while at home.

**00:09:04** And I'm making the same mistakes that I made when I first started attending.

**00:09:10** So I just have to learn from it that if this happens again, I think it will.

**00:09:15** And I need to approach it a little differently. And I've already learned a lot this week.

**00:09:19** I was going to say as a record for future you while you are still in the middle of it, what are your top tips for future Mike for how to do this better next time?

**00:09:30** One, move all non-timely podcasts, record them the week before or skip them.

**00:09:37** Two, leave lots of space in the calendar for the inevitable things that will be put into your calendar.

**00:09:43** Oh, yeah, that's a good one. That's a good one.

**00:09:46** And three, have more of a plan beforehand as to what information you want to get.

**00:09:54** My friends that write reviews like Federico and John, they plan their kind of content gathering like a month before.

**00:10:04** Right. They start being like, this is what I want to research. This is how I'm going to approach it.

**00:10:08** I had no idea because I didn't think that I would be. I've been watching session videos for developers.

**00:10:15** Yeah, you're not writing a review.

**00:10:16** No, but I do need to be informed. And typically, that information was disseminated to me via these conversations that we would have with friends.

**00:10:26** And whilst I've been having some I message conversations just don't do the job, really.

**00:10:31** So I have been watching session videos and I've never watched session videos before.

**00:10:36** So the sessions that Apple developers would usually present, they've made like video versions from Apple's campus and they're talking about what's going on.

**00:10:46** And typically, I watched what are called the overviews where they kind of introduce a big feature.

**00:10:51** I'll get about halfway through and then it goes over my head and I stop watching it because then it starts to get into the code or whatever.

**00:10:57** But like I'm trying to understand like where are they coming from with this stuff? Why are they doing it? What are the key things I need to understand?

**00:11:04** I didn't think that I was going to watch any of those videos because I never did before.

**00:11:10** Because I never needed to. And I've come to realize this week that I have needed to try and get more background information.

**00:11:19** So one of the things that's been happening is on two of my podcasts this week, Upgrade and Connected that are coming out this week.

**00:11:27** I've had the opportunity to interview some engineers and marketing people at Apple about the features.

**00:11:34** Oh, that's very exciting.

**00:11:36** Yeah, that's been a first for me and that has definitely added to the pressure.

**00:11:41** Added to the workload.

**00:11:42** Yes.

**00:11:43** Like so, you know, these are two podcast recordings that I wasn't expecting and I really needed to be prepared for those.

**00:11:55** Because that was important to me that I was going into these with all of my questions, everything researched, really making sure I get the most out of that time.

**00:12:05** So, yeah.

**00:12:06** I can only imagine what that looks like because listeners, as I mentioned many times, one of the things I really appreciate about doing Cortex with Mike is how incredibly thorough the show notes are.

**00:12:16** Right. That like Mike makes very detailed show notes going through topics that we may or may not cover.

**00:12:23** And I can only imagine if for this show, the level of show notes that you create, if if you were then in an interview situation, you're going to want to have

**00:12:35** prepared show notes and you want to know the topics that the person is going to be talking about.

**00:12:41** So I can easily imagine that adding two interviews to your schedule adds many hours of preparation to to get it right.

**00:12:50** Yeah. Lots of hours of preparation, writing questions, anticipating follow up questions, writing those follow up questions based on the answers I think people will give me.

**00:13:00** Like it's that's a big thing.

**00:13:03** Like that's how I prepare for interviews.

**00:13:05** Right. You're doing the pretend answers in your head that the other person gives you and then it's like, OK, what would be a good follow up question to that?

**00:13:10** Yeah. Yeah. To make sure that I'm really prepared.

**00:13:13** Like I never want to be in an interview situation and feel like I'm fumbling.

**00:13:18** Right. I hate that feeling.

**00:13:19** So I try and like anticipate what follow up questions I might have based on what I think answers might be.

**00:13:26** And then there's just an additional pressure in that, like making sure that those interviews go well, making sure that they fit within the podcast recordings that we're doing around them,

**00:13:34** editing the interviews to make sure that they're clean.

**00:13:37** Like, you know, there's I basically edit those the way I edit cortex, you know, really like taking a fine tooth comb to them.

**00:13:45** So, yeah, it's been a it's been a weird week, but a good week, but also a really tiring week.

**00:13:53** I feel so bad because I'm sitting here and all I can think is I'd totally forgotten about the WDC.

**00:14:01** It's like two days later, I was like, oh, wait a minute.

**00:14:05** It's just maybe there's a thing I can watch. And there was what is time, you know?

**00:14:10** Yeah, I was as very what is time.

**00:14:12** And I completely forgot that WDC existed.

**00:14:15** And now I'm listening to what Mike had to go through.

**00:14:19** And I feel bad. But, you know, this is the busy week of your life.

**00:14:23** This is the big week. This is my like Super Bowl or whatever sporting analogy you'd like to make.

**00:14:29** This is the big game. Yeah, Apple.

**00:14:33** But I think for me, it's like it's it's more that this is a big week for the stuff that I make.

**00:14:40** Oh, yeah.

**00:14:40** Have a lot of listeners to these episodes.

**00:14:43** Like people want the content more than normal.

**00:14:46** Even they want to hear what we have to say. It puts a lot of emphasis on it for me.

**00:14:51** You know, it's like this week and then the iPhone announcement week for most of the shows that I do.

**00:14:56** That's about as big as they get, you know. Yeah.

**00:14:59** And adding pressure into those and unknown into it has really,

**00:15:07** really kind of ramped up the stress level this week because not really knowing what WWDC was

**00:15:13** going to be like and how we would cover it has been a lot to to deal with.

**00:15:18** Plus, I mean, we're going to talk about some other stuff in a minute that I've been working on.

**00:15:22** That's, you know, launching a whole new thing on top of all of this has been quite the experience.

**00:15:29** Yeah, it's been it's been a wild couple of weeks.

**00:15:32** Yeah. Busy week on top of a busy month for you for sure.

**00:17:41** Our thanks to FitBud for their support of this show and Relay FM.

**00:18:11** Genuinely have no sense of time. And I have nothing to report about my boring life where

**00:18:19** days are the same. And I'm just like, just working on my videos. And it's like, Oh,

**00:18:24** right, there was a WWDC. And this is like the only thing on my calendar for two months. And I missed

**00:18:30** it and forgot about it. So everything's everything's fine with me. Just having the nice little daily

**00:18:36** routine each day exactly the same as the last. Like we're in maximum routine mode. Yeah, yeah,

**00:18:43** we are in maximum routine because there's nothing else. There's two choices. There's the you existing

**00:18:48** in the structure that you create for yourself, but you're floating aimlessly in the void. That's what

**00:18:53** life is like right now. I actually went to mega studio. Oh, yeah. Yeah. How did you get to mega

**00:18:59** studio? We took an Uber. Okay. Was this like the first time you've been out of the house in

**00:19:06** months? The first time I've been anywhere significant. Yeah. Okay. Like I've taken

**00:19:12** walks around the neighborhood. Yeah. But this is the first time I ever went to like a different

**00:19:18** geographical place. Right. This is the first time you've left like the radius of your house.

**00:19:24** Yeah. How was that experience? It was, it felt way more normal than I was expecting. Okay. So like,

**00:19:31** be real, I was a little bit concerned about myself that I was going to start like fearing

**00:19:36** the outdoors because I was starting to feel a little bit like that. Right. Yeah. Yeah. The

**00:19:41** last time we spoke, I do, I do remember thinking like I was, I was slightly worried that you were

**00:19:46** going to become a bit agoraphobic. Yeah. I've been worried about that too. But that was not your

**00:19:51** experience. No. I mean, what I'm concerned about is the virus, right? Right. And so luckily for me,

**00:19:59** at least I have been able to keep those things separate. Like outdoors isn't problem. Virus

**00:20:05** is problem. Ah, okay. But that's a good mental pattern to reinforce. That has been able to keep

**00:20:11** me kind of grounded for a bit. Cause there was a, probably like a six week period where I did not

**00:20:18** leave my front door. That was just where I was during this like, so long, like we've been,

**00:20:26** this has been going on for so long now. Basically that's some of the lockdown restrictions were

**00:20:31** being lifted. We had some deliveries where the companies were basically calling every day and

**00:20:38** be like, we, we have to deliver this to you now. Oh, oh, you mean deliveries for the mega studio.

**00:20:44** Yeah. So we ordered a large rug and a sofa for the studio in February, right? These things were

**00:20:52** ready to be delivered in March, but it was too late. So they've just been sitting in warehouses

**00:21:00** for like three months and it kind of got to the point where the sofa company was like,

**00:21:07** this has to leave now. So you just, you, this, this isn't a question. You just have to tell us

**00:21:12** what date we're bringing it. We set it up to have both things delivered at the same time. And

**00:21:17** just go see how everything was there and get everything set up. And it's great. Like we've

**00:21:22** got a nice sofa and chair and then now on this huge rug, it's actually something called a carpet

**00:21:27** remnant, which our friend Jason tipped me onto, which is if a big company is like carpeting,

**00:21:35** I don't know, like a hotel or whatever, they have very large pieces of carpet left over

**00:21:41** and there are a lot of companies that do this. You can just request a size and they'll just

**00:21:46** cut a piece of carpet to that size and back it like a rug. Hmm. Oh, okay. That makes sense.

**00:21:51** So it's effectively a huge rug, but it's just a large piece of carpet, right? But it doesn't

**00:21:57** get laid like carpet. You know, like you don't actually fix it to the floor. It's just a huge rug.

**00:22:03** So we got all that set up and it's really like, it's come together. Do you get to pick the pattern

**00:22:08** or do you just say like, I need to give me anything. No, you choose. Like those people who

**00:22:13** buy books by the weight and like, look, I need to, I need to make my office impressive to other

**00:22:17** people. I need 20 feet of books. I don't care what books. Is that a thing? Yeah, that's totally a

**00:22:23** thing. Did you not know that you can buy books by the foot and it's for office decorations and stuff.

**00:22:29** I don't care what those books are. I'm not going to read them. That's the people who are going to

**00:22:33** be impressed by feet of books. Won't know what they are anyway. No, it's not like that. You can

**00:22:38** pick from styles and then they have like size ranges that they can do within different styles.

**00:22:45** So that was actually pretty nice. I'll say that like it was stressful in the sense of us not really

**00:22:51** having a good sense of procedure for the studio. Like we do at home. Right. When anybody passes the

**00:23:01** threshold of the home, there is like a set of steps that we go through to be comfortable

**00:23:08** in like sanitizing little chlorine spray on everyone passing through the front door.

**00:23:14** Yeah. It's like one of those like he's, I don't know, like he's hitting science fiction moves,

**00:23:18** like an airlock. Yeah. Your hands up. Yeah. You think it's braid, turn around, hands up again,

**00:23:23** spray, then they can come in. Yeah. I got one of those. I understand. And there's just,

**00:23:27** there's more kind of back and forth with the studio, right? Because we don't, obviously it's a,

**00:23:32** because it's a large space and I have a bathroom in our studio. There's like communal bathrooms,

**00:23:38** right? Oh, right. I forgot about that. So there's stuff like that, which we hadn't really been

**00:23:42** thinking about where like there's more in and out and we have deliveries, which means that people

**00:23:48** had to come into the space. And so it was just much more of a to do and we didn't really have our

**00:23:58** plan for sanitizing. So it was just much more stressful, but we've now kind of like made that

**00:24:07** a priority for the future of having a plan for sanitizing. Let me ask you. So having,

**00:24:17** you know, cause the thing I like to ask everyone is like, Oh, when's the next time you're going to

**00:24:20** get on a flight? Right. But it just occurs to me now that there's a much smaller version of this,

**00:24:25** which is when's the next time you're going to step into an Uber? And I feel like having broken that

**00:24:31** seal, what I'm wondering is, are you thinking of maybe working from mega office more regularly

**00:24:38** going forward? Like, is that a thing that you might consider having broken the Uber seal? Yeah. We

**00:24:45** have decided like, so we did it once, right? And it went well, but it was also a disaster in its own

**00:24:51** way because again, like we just didn't have our procedures in place. So we decided we would leave

**00:24:58** it for like a couple of weeks. Like I was too busy this week to even think about it anyway. Yeah.

**00:25:02** No, no, no. This week is not the time. Our plan is next week, we're going to go back and we're

**00:25:07** going to spend some time there. We're going to do some little things that we need to take care of.

**00:25:11** We have hand sanitizing stations that we're going to be putting in place inside of the studio. And

**00:25:16** then I'm going to do some work from there. I'm going to try and like realign ourselves to where

**00:25:21** we were three months ago in the plan. All right. Now what things do we need to continue trying to

**00:25:28** get this place set up? Because very aware of where we are, right? And like, like everyone,

**00:25:34** I don't stop thinking about coronavirus, you know, it's always ever present.

**00:25:39** But at the same time, I want to live my life a little bit. And we're being very careful

**00:25:49** wearing face coverings, ensuring that anyone around us is wearing face coverings. We are also going to

**00:25:56** start taking public transport again at some point. Like we're not just going to only Uber. Okay.

**00:26:01** Because you know, if we go, if we get trains at the right time, we can stand further away from

**00:26:06** people than we can in a car. Yeah. There's an interesting calculation there about the risk. And

**00:26:11** I can totally see that if you time the train right, I would feel like the train is less of a risk than

**00:26:17** an Uber. And we were doing that before anyway, because we just didn't want to be in the rush hour.

**00:26:24** So we were getting trains at times when there weren't a lot of people. So, you know, we've got

**00:26:28** to work that out, but I'm paying rent on a studio space that I really want to be in. Yeah. So we're

**00:26:37** going to start looking at how we can make that more of a feasible part of our lives. Now, what

**00:26:43** I'm not going to be doing is the move that is paused. The idea of moving to the studio, that's

**00:26:50** not happening. All right. So what are you envisioning as the studio life then where you're

**00:26:58** there more, but you're not moving your work there? I don't really, I don't understand what your plan

**00:27:03** is here. I will be working from there, but not removing the home office. Okay. Because the plan

**00:27:10** was there just wouldn't be a home office anymore. Right. Right. That was all the equipment was going

**00:27:15** to the studio, but I can't do that in case overnight we're locked down again. Okay. All

**00:27:23** right. That makes sense. That makes sense. So I still need to have the ability to work from here.

**00:27:28** So I will set it up like halfway basically is the plan. So then we can, I don't know,

**00:27:34** maybe a few days a week, we can be in the studio instead and we can work from there and see what

**00:27:41** that's like. So that's kind of where I am with the studio stuff. Yeah. That makes sense. You know,

**00:27:47** in the matrix of calculations that we all have to do of risks versus rewards,

**00:27:54** that feels reasonable. It feels like a pretty reasonable thing to try. And you also have a

**00:28:00** fairly big upside there of having a different space to go to than just your apartment.

**00:28:05** Mega Studio was for my mental health as well. Yeah. Right. And I would more than anything

**00:28:13** love somewhere else to work from more than I wanted it in March. Yeah. I totally understand.

**00:28:23** I'm not going anywhere else. Right. Like the plan was I would still be traveling when I had the

**00:28:28** studio. Like I would travel less, but I still would be. And I'm not doing that either. Mega Studio is

**00:28:35** has been like the thought of it the whole time. And I just sent you some pictures of what we've

**00:28:40** got going on, like what we've been doing. It was always meant to be set up as like a very comfortable

**00:28:44** place to be. Like that was what I wanted. So I would enjoy being there and would happily spend

**00:28:51** work time there. And I really want to be in this space that I had started to create where, you know,

**00:29:01** it was like you have a blank canvas to build your working environment. So you can have what you want

**00:29:09** rather than use what you bought. Right. Because the office here is I've said this many times,

**00:29:16** it is not fit for purpose anymore because I made it a certain way, changed what I wanted to use it

**00:29:24** for. And I also don't want to be in it in the long term anyway. Like that was the plan was always to

**00:29:30** get something out of home. So it felt kind of fruitless to even attempt to try and get this

**00:29:35** office right when it even no matter how good I would get it, it would always feel like not what

**00:29:41** I wanted. Right. Yeah. Which was an out of home office space. And now I have this space, which is

**00:29:48** like so much more than I need, but it's just what I want. So I want to be able to try and see

**00:29:57** to what level can I use it again? Because very aware of the risks and I'm doing everything I can

**00:30:05** to observe what I hear smart people tell me. But like things are relaxing a little bit more here

**00:30:13** now. And I'm just trying to balance a level of being safe and trying to live my life a little

**00:30:27** differently to the way I've lived it for the last 12 weeks. Yeah. I mean, it, it, it totally makes

**00:30:33** sense. You're making the place look quite cozy and I get it. And I'm with you of like having a

**00:30:38** place to work outside of the home is a huge deal. Like my, my personal goal right now is either

**00:30:46** episode 104 or 105 of this show is the first episode recorded from mega studio. Okay. Sounds

**00:30:54** like it's possible based on what you've said. Yeah. We'll see. I was just sitting here like,

**00:31:06** I don't, I don't dare to guess what, what number cortex it will be where I will again have an

**00:31:12** office outside of the home. So I will be quite envious of you when you're recording from your

**00:31:17** plush mega office hanging out on your blue and yellow couch,

**00:31:22** chilling in, in what looks like a palatial amount of space.

**00:31:29** All that space, Mike, you've got so much that you can do.

**00:31:32** I'm happy for you though. Like I'm genuinely glad that that you're feeling comfortable enough

**00:31:38** to go back and you're like figuring out a way to make this work. And I think it's a sensible

**00:31:43** trade off to make it life. I genuinely believe there is a way to do this safely.

**00:31:48** We just have to be really mindful of it. And that's what we're trying to work through right now.

**00:31:54** Yeah. Stay alert. This episode of cortex is brought to you by express VPN. You may have heard in the

**00:32:01** past how important it is to have a VPN and now that so many of us are working from home,

**00:32:05** it's even more important to have a VPN that you can trust. I've been using express VPN for ages

**00:32:10** now since they first got in touch. And I am super, super happy with my experience there.

**00:32:15** Everything's really fast. And what I love is it's on all of my devices and it's really, really easy

**00:32:20** to connect, simple to use. And that's exactly what I'm looking for out of my VPN provider.

**00:32:25** Express VPN values your privacy. They don't log your data to make money from selling it. Like

**00:32:30** other services could express VPN use the technology that they created called trusted server that only

**00:32:36** stores data in Rams and nothing has helped. And it's super fast. You can stream HD quality videos

**00:32:41** with no lag. And I've done this too. It's really easy to use. You just fire up the app, click one

**00:32:46** button and you're connected. Plus express VPN is loved by tech radar, the verge, CNET and more.

**00:32:52** Protect yourself today. Just go to expressvpn.com slash cortex and get an extra three months free on

**00:32:57** a one year package. That's expressvpn.com slash cortex right now to learn more. Our thanks to

**00:33:03** express VPN for their support of this show and relay FM. So you said you've been working on

**00:33:09** something new, something big this year. And from my perspective, as someone you've talked to about

**00:33:18** this, I would say that this has been the biggest change for how you view relay since the start of

**00:33:27** conceptualizing relay as a company. So we've I've made reference to this on previous episodes that

**00:33:36** it's been difficult, more difficult to run an advertising based business during the pandemic

**00:33:42** than it was before the pandemic. Yes. And I would say that through a lot of work from our side,

**00:33:50** we're in a position which is much better than we thought that we would have been at this point.

**00:33:54** But what it has highlighted to both of us, me and Steven, is thinking about where our efforts should

**00:34:01** be placed and thinking about what we want our company to look like into the future. And for

**00:34:10** about a year or two, we have wanted to do more with our membership program. But we're not sure

**00:34:18** what we wanted to do exactly and how we would do it. Nothing will make you make decisions more than

**00:34:26** threat of your company's existence. Yeah, a random global disaster that threatens the thing that

**00:34:34** you've spent years building focuses the mind. Yeah, it does. And it can, if you are the right

**00:34:41** type of person, drive you to action. And that's what it did for us. So over the last few months,

**00:34:49** we have been working on making some enhancements to what a relay FM membership can be. And we've

**00:34:56** been adding in a lot of features for existing members. So new content been adding in new monthly

**00:35:03** shows that everybody gets. There's a show that me and Steven are doing called Backstage, which is

**00:35:08** basically our advice and tips on how to start a podcast of your own. We added a Discord for

**00:35:15** members. But these were all groundwork for increasing how often we talk about our membership,

**00:35:22** which is usually just been once a year, while we were getting ready to put everything in place

**00:35:28** to allow for something much bigger, which is individual show content. So we've been working

**00:35:36** very hard behind the scenes to effectively create a platform where any relay FM show can make its

**00:35:43** own membership only show. So we have one now, and it's called more text. And more text is longer

**00:35:51** episodes of cortex with no ads. And it costs $5 a month or $50 a year. So you can go to getmoretext.com

**00:36:01** and sign up for the monthly plan, you can go to our website and sign up for the annual plan.

**00:36:05** This is still a part of the relay FM membership program. So it comes with all of the membership

**00:36:09** benefits. So all of the annual bonuses like our text adventures, the extra podcasts, the Discord.

**00:36:15** But if you choose to give your membership money directly to cortex, you also get more text. So

**00:36:22** it's a special feed, which is only available for relay FM members who give them money to cortex

**00:36:29** directly. If you are an existing member who does this, you have access to this. And anybody that

**00:36:35** signs up at getmoretext.com, you will also get access to this. Once you sign up, you get sent

**00:36:40** to a podcast page where you can subscribe just one tap to all major podcast apps. It's really

**00:36:46** easy to do. It's a wonderful system that we've got set in place. And now that we have this system

**00:36:52** set in place, we can offer this extra content because something that we've not had before,

**00:36:57** which was the ability to check for active subscriptions. So now if you stop paying,

**00:37:03** you no longer get the content, which is really important if you want to build a business on this,

**00:37:10** which is what we're trying to do here as a company is to try and build a bigger part of our

**00:37:15** business on membership. So I want to talk a little bit more about MoreText because that's kind of the

**00:37:21** background kind of because I know I think Cortex Listener is a little bit more interested in some

**00:37:25** of the behind the scenes type stuff of this. And I have a little bit more that I want to talk about,

**00:37:31** about me as a content creator and what this means. And one of the reasons that I want to,

**00:37:35** I think, follow you in the way that I think about my business a bit and who I am and what I do.

**00:37:43** But just to kind of give a more concise pitch on MoreText,

**00:37:48** it is longer episodes. So there will be an additional content for people that sign up.

**00:37:53** Because basically what happens is, Gray mentioned my show notes earlier. I always generate tons of

**00:37:58** show notes. We always cut things out of the document that we don't get to. And typically

**00:38:03** what happens is we'll do it next time. And then next time we don't do it. We'll do it next time.

**00:38:07** Next time we don't do it. And then that topic gets so old that it's just removed. But this will allow

**00:38:14** us to actually include more in the show. Because typically what happens is we'll get to a certain

**00:38:21** point and we'll feel like that's probably enough or this stuff doesn't fit with the rest of the

**00:38:26** stuff that we've done in the episode. Yeah, as strange as it's going to sound, it just sort of

**00:38:32** happens every time. But it feels like each of the shows kind of ends up thematic as we're going

**00:38:39** through it. And we do often have a sense by the end of like, oh, this additional thing about, you

**00:38:46** know, oh, this thing that happened this week, like, doesn't feel like it fits anymore. And we always

**00:38:51** have like a resistance to talking about it then. And as we know from over the years now, we lie to

**00:39:00** each other every time about like, we'll talk about it next time. So we could feel better about not

**00:39:06** talking about it this time. But it never happens. And so this, this provides a venue for an additional

**00:39:14** segment that doesn't necessarily have to feel like it's thematic with the rest of the show. Yeah, it

**00:39:20** can be a segment on like, hey, here's the thing that otherwise we will never get to without a

**00:39:25** reason to get to it. So that's that's part of the idea behind more text, which also is the most

**00:39:31** perfect name when you said it was like, great, more text is the is a fantastic name. Get that URL

**00:39:38** immediately get more text.com get more text. And I have it in both of the ways that you'd be willing

**00:39:43** to spell it with them without the E. Oh, okay. I have decided we are spelling it with the E.

**00:39:48** So it's not necessarily like cortex, but I think without the E looks strange to me. So it's

**00:39:55** R E T X not M O R T X. But if you do go to get more text without the E.com, it will work. Okay.

**00:40:04** So confused when you said both ways. I'm like, wait, do you mean like get more text or get more

**00:40:08** texts like M O A R T X. Like I need more more texts. Please don't make me buy you more URLs.

**00:40:16** Great. Okay. More text. Now I need that one as well. So as I'm editing this show, I know what's

**00:40:22** happening. I'm going and buying that URL now. But yeah, basically it just allows for us to have

**00:40:29** extra content. So there's nothing that we're taking away from the show. It's really a stuff that

**00:40:35** and I think this is still a selling point, but like it really is stuff that otherwise would not

**00:40:39** be in an episode, but it's stuff that we still want to talk about. Like a really good example of this

**00:40:47** is the iPad pro magic keyboard. Oh, yeah. Right. I have wanted to talk to you about this product

**00:40:53** for months now. And we've never spoken about it. It's always been in the document and we'll do it

**00:40:59** next time. We'll do it next time. And now it's too old. It's gone. Yeah. But like we would have

**00:41:04** spoken about that type of thing on more text of like here is like a self-contained thing. It

**00:41:09** doesn't fit with the rest of the episode for us, but we can include it as bonus content for people

**00:41:14** that want more from the show. That is a specifically good example because I think that one got

**00:41:20** pushed the most for sure. Or I think anyone who follows me knows like I've just always really

**00:41:26** resistant to timely stuff. And so that that's also a thing that like I push back on sometimes

**00:41:32** as topics of like, I know, no, Mike, like the shows should exist as, as like isolated from the world

**00:41:38** things as much as possible. And this provides a format to sometimes be like, Oh, okay. You know,

**00:41:44** this thing that I wouldn't like as a topic regularly, like we can cover in like the more

**00:41:48** text segment, like we've been talking about the membership. Like this has been like a long

**00:41:54** ongoing conversation about like, what could be done with the membership program? Or like, you know,

**00:41:58** what could, what could we as a show do? And this does feel like the thing that makes the most sense

**00:42:06** to both of us is, you know, I don't want to paywall like an existing part of the show, right? Like we

**00:42:14** wouldn't want to say, Oh, ask cortex is now behind the paywall. And I considered that. Yeah,

**00:42:19** like that was something I thought about. I was like, Oh, what if we just did ask cortex

**00:42:22** as a membership thing? And that didn't work in my mind. Because yeah, I like that being part of the

**00:42:28** show. And, and it's that exact idea. The easy thing to do is to take something that already exists,

**00:42:34** put that behind the paywall. And like, that's the easy way out. Right. But instead, what we are

**00:42:40** going to do is spend time working on all right, what do we have that we can talk about that doesn't

**00:42:45** fit with a show, but it's still stuff that we think cortex listeners would be interested in.

**00:42:51** But if they miss out, they're not losing a big part of the episode. Yeah. I mean, this is such

**00:42:56** a funny thing, because for listeners of or followers of any kind of entertainment or media

**00:43:02** that's that's produced in the world, they may hear something and you hear the solution of like, Oh,

**00:43:06** this is what we're doing. We're doing this thing called more text. And it sounds like, Oh, this is

**00:43:09** very obvious. But it's I always find that there's the feeling of like, it feels like it's the obvious

**00:43:16** first thing that you would think of when it's the right thing to do. Yeah, yeah. But as creators,

**00:43:23** you sometimes stumble around for a really long time trying to figure out like, what's a what's

**00:43:30** a way to do like the freemium model? Like, like what makes sense here to do and what doesn't?

**00:43:35** You try and be really clever with it. Yeah, yeah. That is a trap that's very easy to fall into. You

**00:43:40** try to be too clever with it. Or there's all these various things. And it is just a funny thing,

**00:43:47** because because I'm just thinking of the listener listening to us trying to explain like, Oh, we've

**00:43:51** been talking about this for a long time. And it's like, what is there to talk about for a long time?

**00:43:55** It seems very obvious. But it isn't obvious in the trying to figure it out phase, like what makes

**00:44:01** sense. And so, yeah, this this is what we landed on. And also a big thing for me, it was also the

**00:44:07** ad free back catalog. Yes, yeah. So that we actually we haven't mentioned that yet. So not only are

**00:44:13** there no ads in the episodes that are current, we have also gone back and removed the ads from all

**00:44:19** of the episodes in the more text feed. Because if you sign up for more text, you get a new feed,

**00:44:24** which has the entire back catalog of the show. Yeah. So you don't need to be subscribed to both

**00:44:29** if you want to listen to old episodes. And I've been doing this stuff with some of my other shows

**00:44:34** as well doing ad free with more content. I'm doing that with two other shows right now. But they

**00:44:40** don't have ad free back catalogs. Because, yeah, two reasons. One, they both have 300 episodes,

**00:44:46** and that feels like a horrible job to do. And two, I just don't think that those shows are as

**00:44:51** re-listenable because they are purely current event stuff. Yeah. Where Cortex has more of an

**00:44:58** inherent re-listenability to it. Or for new people coming to the show, there is more of a benefit

**00:45:06** to go back and listen to some of the old episodes. So I thought that that made a lot of sense for

**00:45:12** providing to people that want to become more text subscribers. Yeah. And that was like, you know,

**00:45:19** this is also a thing that it was very easy for me to say the words like, all the episodes should

**00:45:26** be ad free, comma, Mike. Yeah. Because we all know like, who's the person who's going to end up having

**00:45:33** to actually do the work for that. But again, thinking about like, you know, trying to figure out

**00:45:41** what are we going to do as the Cortex part of the Relay FM membership program? And thinking about

**00:45:49** like the kinds of stuff that I support, the ad free was like a big deal for me and also the ad

**00:45:56** free back catalog. But I was, you know, I was aware in discussions that this was really throwing

**00:46:02** something over the wall to be like, I'm going to say these three, four words. And it's going to mean

**00:46:08** many hours of work for Mike on the other end. So I'm sorry about that. I definitely agreed with it,

**00:46:14** but it was a lot of work. Like making the back catalog took many, many, many, many, many hours.

**00:46:19** So one, I'm so happy we have kept all of the logic projects for this show. I don't do that for my

**00:46:26** other shows, but we have always kept from episode one onwards, the entire projects. We saved them

**00:46:32** in Dropbox and it's like 700 gigabytes or something at this point. Yeah. It's a crazy amount of data.

**00:46:39** And so I've gone in and opened up every episode, removed all of the ads, tightened up the transitions,

**00:46:46** re-exported the shows and have re-uploaded them for the more text feed. Because of the way we edit,

**00:46:54** it was like, I had to do like so much checking. Like sometimes there are multiple logic projects

**00:46:59** for each episode. What do you mean, Mike? I don't understand. Like great edit, final, final, final

**00:47:05** for, for publish.logic. I don't know what you're talking about. And so having to open up every

**00:47:10** project, check it's the right runtime against the published episode. Right. That was what I was

**00:47:15** doing. Okay. That's a good idea. Right. That makes sense. And then pulling out the ads,

**00:47:20** re-exporting them, re-uploading them. This was like the perfect example of on paper,

**00:47:25** a job somebody else could and maybe should do, but is something I would only trust myself to do.

**00:47:31** Yeah. This is, this is a perfect example of that sort of job. It does seem like it should be fine,

**00:47:36** but we don't want like the half edited version of the show to end up being like one of the version

**00:47:42** that goes up. And ultimately you're the best person to be able to check that and be able to

**00:47:49** make sure like, yes, this is really the correct one in spite of my very consistent file naming

**00:47:54** method, which was there to help you really a good, good system along the way. Yeah. Cause the more

**00:48:01** finals there are that's that makes you, that lets you know that it's the really final one.

**00:48:05** Going back to those early episodes, like the way we sound so different to now, one,

**00:48:12** our microphones are different. So just the audio quality is better. And two,

**00:48:17** both of our accents are very different now. I know how like your accent is messed up,

**00:48:24** but although I would still say, I think your accent is definitely, is it fair of me to say better?

**00:48:30** Oh, I think it's better. I hate the way I sound in the early episodes.

**00:48:33** Chim chiminey me gov, you know, like it's, it's terrible for me. Like I, I prefer this now.

**00:48:39** Okay. Good. Like you said it. I didn't say it, right. But I think you, um, you've developed

**00:48:45** a more professional radio voice is maybe a way to put it. I've rounded off the rough edges.

**00:48:50** Yeah. You sound less like you've come from the gutter. Oh, no, that's not fair. You can't say it.

**00:48:57** I think the thing for you is like, I couldn't tell you what it is, but I can tell it's different.

**00:49:03** And that's normal. Like if I go back through the back catalogs of any show I've done,

**00:49:08** everyone sounds different because people's voices change. The changes you get older,

**00:49:12** they change depending on the type of people you talk to, where they come from. Um, and you pick up

**00:49:17** like affectations from other people. Like it's very normal. Yeah. Yeah. There's, I must think

**00:49:23** of them as like linguistic fashions that make their way around. And also I, like much more so

**00:49:30** for me than you, I'm much more used to just talking in a podcast format. Like there's less

**00:49:36** metacognition going on when I'm talking on a podcast and there was before like I have to pay

**00:49:42** attention less. And I imagine that can sort of change the way that a person sounds because you

**00:49:47** probably, because of that sound more relaxed now than you would have before. Yeah, probably. So it

**00:49:53** was just funny to go through those old episodes and hear the progression like at high speed. Oh,

**00:49:59** right. Yes. Cause I guess you'd be listening to a little segment of each of them. Right.

**00:50:02** Right. You're flying through time at a hundred acts is what you're doing. And something that only

**00:50:08** I care about, but I do care about it. They're all re-encoded at a higher bit rate. So they sound

**00:50:12** better to me. Oh nice. It's like the Blu-ray release. Yeah. There's the special editions.

**00:50:18** Because I'll tell you as well, I have George Lucas them a little bit when I was editing some

**00:50:22** stuff, recent stuff, it's like, Oh, there's a breath in here that I would take out now.

**00:50:26** Let me just take it out. So there are very minor differences between the more text versions and the

**00:50:34** cortex versions. Yeah. I think you want to say the remastered edition, right? The special edition

**00:50:39** would be if we went back and like rerecorded lines we didn't like with our new different voices. And

**00:50:46** so it would fit just perfectly. Right. I'm so, I really want to do that now. Like somewhere in the

**00:50:53** back catalog, like just put in one conversation, right? Like just like a very short, Oh, that would

**00:51:00** be so fun. We're not going to do it. Or are we? We're not going to do it, but it would be fun anyway.

**00:51:04** It would be an amazing Easter egg. If there was a small new segment somewhere in that back catalog.

**00:51:12** Oh, I wish I would have thought of this earlier. What a selling point, right? It's like the golden

**00:51:17** ticket. Yeah. CGP Grey and the podcast factory. Yeah. That's, you know, it's tempting. You know,

**00:51:28** it could happen at any time. I guess that makes me the Oompa Loompa, which I'm not that happy about.

**00:51:34** Sure. Yeah. You have to be, I think in this scenario, you are the Oompa Loompa and I'm the,

**00:51:40** I'm the madman, maybe driving a boat to a land of insanity or maybe not. Who knows? Yeah. Yeah.

**00:51:46** I can imagine that. Wait, spoilers for Charlie and the chocolate factory. I could be the,

**00:51:50** the guy who pretends to work for the other chocolate factory. Oh, there's neither villain.

**00:51:57** He's the villain of the, no, he pretends to be the villain. Oh, that's right. Right. I don't know.

**00:52:04** Look, there's, we don't have very many options of who works in the chocolate factory. Not really.

**00:52:09** There's really only two people. You know, in all of this, right, for me, it's about thinking

**00:52:17** what my business looks like for me. So last year was the year of diversification for me. Right.

**00:52:24** And one of the elements of that was Cortex brand. And that continues to be an ongoing project. But

**00:52:32** similarly now it's like, okay, my main product that I make available to the world is audio

**00:52:40** content. That's what I quote unquote sell. And the way it is sold right now is put out for free,

**00:52:47** supported by advertising. And as a side note, if you do not subscribe to more text or can't,

**00:52:53** or don't want to just by listening to this show, you continue to support both of us because we have

**00:52:58** advertisements on our show. So it's like the way that you would say it, like completely guilt free.

**00:53:03** Right. Like, yeah, just by listening to this show, you are supporting us. That is fantastic. Right.

**00:53:08** And that has been what allows me and us to continue doing all the work that we do is at the moment,

**00:53:14** primarily advertising. But I have this other opportunity here where I can offer more of what

**00:53:22** I do, but make it available for people to purchase from me, which is not really something

**00:53:29** that I've done before in any serious way. Because I know this about myself, I subscribe to membership

**00:53:37** programs for my favorite podcasts to get additional content from them, because they're the shows that

**00:53:43** I love. And there is always an element to this of like, Oh, I want to support those creators.

**00:53:49** But for me more, it's like, no, I love this show so much. I want to get more of it.

**00:53:54** So like, I want to subscribe to this membership or this Patreon to get additional content.

**00:53:59** And I've just kind of gotten to the point where I want to be able to offer it. And we have got the

**00:54:05** technology to be able to offer it in the way that we want to. Like advertising has been wonderful

**00:54:10** for me. I know how to make it work for our audiences. But this kind of revenue model is

**00:54:17** susceptible to market forces outside of my control. Yeah, that's what I've learned more

**00:54:24** now than anything. Because this stuff had always happened in like little pockets, you know, like

**00:54:29** company runs out of money and needs to cancel its advertising. Like, okay, like it happens. But

**00:54:36** nothing will make you realize the volatility of industry than a pandemic, right? Like it has the

**00:54:43** ability to shake all the leaves out the trees. And that's what's happened. And again, we are in a

**00:54:50** much better position than I thought we would be because of a lot of hard work. But I have had

**00:54:56** highlighted to me that there is a risk area. And also for myself, I felt for a while that I want

**00:55:05** to be able to focus more on the content side of what I do, and less on the running of an advertising

**00:55:14** business side of what I personally do. So going forward, I want to be able to put more of my own

**00:55:23** work time into making the best content I can, rather than trying to run an advertising business.

**00:55:32** Right. So like, behind the scenes at Relay FM, we have a very talented sales manager that we

**00:55:39** work with. And over time, what I want to do is transition more and more of the advertising

**00:55:46** business to her instead of me. So I can focus on doing what I want to do. The whole reason that I

**00:55:54** created any podcast and then co-founded this company is to make podcasts, not to sell ads.

**00:56:03** I sold the ads because the ads needed to be sold. So we could make this our living. But the ads was

**00:56:10** never what I wanted to do. I just had to do it because someone had to do it. Right. But what I

**00:56:16** am best at is making podcasts. Like that's my skill. And I want to do more of that. So going

**00:56:24** forward, I want my work to be supported by advertisers and by listeners. So I am putting

**00:56:34** more time into making more content in that way. And in many ways, I have looked up to you and what

**00:56:43** you do. And when you made that transition, you made that really great kind of like open letter

**00:56:48** type video talking about this, I think it started to plant the seeds in my head of like,

**00:56:54** that's actually where I want to be. Focusing on making the best content that I can

**00:57:01** and hoping that people will choose to support that content and get something extra. Right.

**00:57:08** That goes around it. As a side note, I have a new yearly theme. Oh, we will talk about this next

**00:57:14** episode. Oh, okay. We have not got enough time to get into that today. But I encourage our listeners

**00:57:22** to also consider changing their yearly themes if they are unhappy with them.

**00:57:26** Because I am my yearly theme. I cannot do it. Everything I wanted to do, I cannot do.

**00:57:32** Well, you know, it is a great time to think about adjusting your yearly theme because we have just

**00:57:36** crossed the threshold into official summer. A new season, as they say. So it is a brand new season.

**00:57:42** I mean, of course, pandemic season lays over all of this, but it is a brand new season. So, yes,

**00:57:47** excellent time to reconsider yearly themes. But I have just gone through so much over the last

**00:57:52** three months. Yeah. That it has made me face rethinking what I do. So I now have a yearly theme

**00:58:02** in place to focus on that for the rest of this year, at least, which is tying into this idea of

**00:58:11** what do I actually do? Right? Like, what do I make? And what I want to make is content.

**00:58:18** And make that content the best it can be. So that this is in a couple of ways, right? Like,

**00:58:24** this isn't just making the best membership content. I want to make the best shows that I can possibly

**00:58:32** make. And also make the best membership content I can possibly make by creating the membership stuff

**00:58:40** and having that as a potentially sustainable part of my income and my business. I believe

**00:58:48** that it will allow me to be able to put more focus on the content that I create in general,

**00:58:54** with a feeling of stability there. Therefore, allowing me to put more focus on the shows. Like,

**00:59:03** I believe this will help Cortex itself get better, because I will be able to put even more focus into

**00:59:11** making the show as best as it can possibly be. Yeah. And that makes sense from a creator

**00:59:18** psychological perspective. Because if you think about how do you fund content, you have advertising

**00:59:26** and you have member supports and crowdfunding. And advertising is the, what I think it is,

**00:59:34** the high variance part of that question. And crowdfunding is the reliable part of that question.

**00:59:44** And I do think that the membership program in the past has basically been a like

**00:59:51** annual birthday celebration for Relay. Yeah. Is probably the best way to put it. It's like,

**00:59:57** it's Relay birthday time. Happy birthday to Relay. And there's a bunch of fun bonus shows.

**01:00:03** But I do think that there is a lot of benefit psychologically as a creator to be having a more

**01:00:12** like direct connection with the audience in a way that the crowdfunding model encourages.

**01:00:20** So I've been very interested, you know, to see you like move towards this. And I think it totally

**01:00:27** makes sense for Relay and for you, like and for Cortex as like an adjustment and a change in the

**01:00:35** business model going forward. Getmoretex.com. However you spell it, any way you can think of

**01:00:41** spelling. Not any way. Not any way. I believe that's what Mike said. Any of the ways you can

**01:00:49** think of spelling. Getmoretex. Hypically conceivable ways of spelling that URL. Right.

**01:00:56** Is what I will say. Getmoretex.com. I'm gonna blow like the entire first month on just domains.

**01:01:05** This episode of Cortex is brought to you by Raycon. Whether you're working from home or working on

**01:01:10** your fitness, you want what you're listening to to be what you're listening to. You don't want to be

**01:01:15** listening to your roommates on a conference call or a vacuum cleaner in the apartment next door.

**01:01:20** Everybody needs a great pair of wireless earbuds. But before you go dropping hundreds of dollars on

**01:01:25** a new set, you should really check out Raycon's wireless earbuds. Raycon earbuds start at about

**01:01:30** half the price of any other premium wireless earbuds on the market and they sound fantastic.

**01:01:35** Compared to other top audio brands, you are getting significant value for your money.

**01:01:40** Their newest model, the Everyday E25 earbuds, are their best yet. They have six hours of playtime,

**01:01:46** seamless Bluetooth pairing and even more bass, all in a super compact design that gives you a nice,

**01:01:51** noise isolating fit. Raycon's wireless earbuds are really comfortable even after long periods of time

**01:01:57** so it's perfect for those long zoom calls or for podcasts like this one. Raycon earbuds are stylish,

**01:02:02** discreet and truly wireless. No cords or wires to get in the way. I was super surprised not just how

**01:02:08** small the earbuds are themselves but the case as well. It has a great battery in it but it's tiny

**01:02:13** and they have a very satisfying magnet that keeps it all closed when you're opening clothes and it's

**01:02:18** got like a good good shut to the case which you really want. Sounds just like this. Very satisfying,

**01:02:23** that's what you want. That's a good that's a good open close right there. Very nice. The earbuds fit

**01:02:28** in my ears perfectly. The seal was really great. They're really nice and noise isolating. I was

**01:02:32** very impressed and they also have a button on the earbuds themselves which gives simple and easy

**01:02:37** controls for pausing, skipping tracks and stuff like that. That was one of my favorite features.

**01:03:04** All right so it's WWDC. Oh right. WWDC 2020. I forgot about that. This has got to be the

**01:03:10** longest of any of our WWDC episodes before we really get to WWDC proper, you know, the meat

**01:03:17** of WWDC. Well the theme system conversation was quite long. That's the thing. The theme

**01:03:22** system's a year old now. Oh is it? Yeah because we we announced the journal on our WWDC episode last

**01:03:29** year. Right. How young and naive we were about timelines back then.

**01:03:34** We have a look. All right in case you're wondering we have some on a boat right now.

**01:03:38** I will tell this story later but there are some on a boat which is a new experience for us

**01:03:47** but there are journals on a boat. So there's quite a lot of stuff that happened at WWDC this year.

**01:03:56** More than I was expecting considering the circumstances of the world. I think I was

**01:04:00** actually quite surprised at the output that Apple had. Before you start getting into like

**01:04:07** the specifics of it can I just say I think Apple should never do a live event again. All right so

**01:04:15** this is a controversial opinion that I have so many conflicted feelings about. Okay. Because if

**01:04:22** they never do another live event again it means I never got to go to one which is the thing

**01:04:27** right that that will always bug me. However however the presentation of their

**01:04:34** keynote their video was so much more entertaining. Yeah okay so so it was an interesting viewing

**01:04:42** experience right. Actually you must know I don't know. On YouTube did they premiere the video or

**01:04:48** did it go up like after it was live on Apple's website or something like how did that how did

**01:04:53** the logistics of that actually work. I expect they premiered it. I watched it on Apple's official

**01:04:58** stream. Okay. But they did have a YouTube video that was going up at the same time so I assume

**01:05:05** they used the premiere feature and they've never put it up on YouTube immediately before. Mm-hmm.

**01:05:10** But they did this time. All right but I presume when you were watching it like you couldn't

**01:05:14** fast forward on the Apple thing like they didn't make it available as here's just a file. You know

**01:05:18** it's like live recorded live like you know like it was a video that obviously they were not live

**01:05:23** right. Nothing was live it was all pre-recorded. I love how complicated it is to try to explain in

**01:05:28** the modern world the concept of broadcast TV right is like well there's a thing that you've recorded

**01:05:34** and it's playing but it's not. Yeah it's just it's it's funny to me how this idea has like fallen off

**01:05:39** the world in a funny way. So they premiered this thing and they did a fantastic job of putting on

**01:05:47** a show. Now the one thing I was aware of is they had the huge advantage that they really leaned on

**01:05:55** of hey we can use this as an opportunity to take you on like a pseudo tour of the campus of like

**01:06:04** their new Apple spaceship campus and I thought that was kind of a great framing of all of the

**01:06:11** content and added like an extra little bit of fun of like oh you know where is this theater exactly

**01:06:19** oh where is the exercise area in Apple? Is the secret lab really underneath the lake? I don't

**01:06:25** know but I kind of assume that it is now like I think that was really fun and that's not an

**01:06:31** advantage that they would have in the future but it worked great for this one but I don't know like

**01:06:35** just watching it the only thing I could think the whole time is like I don't think they should

**01:06:40** ever do another live event again. I think that they should make produced videos for people to

**01:06:47** watch in this way and maybe maybe the only thing that they could do is like it wouldn't really

**01:06:56** make any sense but they could do a live presentation to some people they lock down under a life

**01:07:01** destroying non-disclosure agreement. That's pointless. You think that's pointless? It's

**01:07:06** kind of like I think it's one or the other do one or the other you either do it all live or not live.

**01:07:12** I'm trying to think of a way that you could attend one of these right is like you could be in the

**01:07:17** audience because it is funny to think that they built this brand new Steve Jobs theater and is

**01:07:25** like do we need to use it you know maybe it's just for company movie night is what happens.

**01:07:30** Honestly I think that they really like having the press there. I do and they like having it they

**01:07:37** like being able to take these people and show them the products afterwards and have all the

**01:07:41** videos made and all that kind of stuff. It would surprise me if they moved away from that. I would

**01:07:47** say I could more imagine them making this video for WWDC and I can't imagine them doing it for

**01:07:55** the iPhone. Oh I was yeah I wasn't really thinking about the iPhone. Okay I don't know I think if I

**01:08:02** was at Apple I'd like I'd still my vote if I was on the executive team would be to say like let's

**01:08:07** never bother with these live events again. I think this went this went well enough even though

**01:08:11** there's a kind of excitement there but I'm going to bet that you're right that the live events

**01:08:18** continue. That this ends up being a like a one-off but I really do want to congratulate them on how

**01:08:24** well it was done and it was it was just very interesting to watch. Just a couple of little

**01:08:28** stylistic choices I was really aware of like even how right in the beginning they have the camera

**01:08:34** on the stage pointed at Tim Cook with the empty audience in the background. Yeah and I thought

**01:08:40** like oh it's the right call that's totally the right call like everyone knows why this is happening.

**01:08:45** Because it was like it started like you see the screen as normal and then the camera moved around

**01:08:50** him right and then he was facing the camera. Yeah one I like that move because they immediately

**01:08:56** were able to show you this is not going to look like what you're used to. Right. Which I thought

**01:09:00** was quite a clever framing device but then all you say it's like owning it right like this is what

**01:09:05** you're used to seeing there should be people in those seats there's nobody in those seats. Yeah

**01:09:09** it was it was really well done if I'm not going to be like in previous years physically in California

**01:09:17** where it can be fun to watch the live stream with other people who are there for WWDC and it becomes

**01:09:24** like a community experience like that's fun and I would miss that but the highly produced video I

**01:09:30** just I found like a much better denser snappier way to convey the information. Which makes sense

**01:09:37** right like if you have the ability to A do multiple takes and B edit after the fact you have the

**01:09:44** ability to make and you should make a more engaging better paced video. You can pull those

**01:09:51** editing tricks like you can have that hidden cut where Craig goes off camera so he can cut catch

**01:09:57** his breath after running up the stairs and then pop back in and keep talking normally you know

**01:10:02** like oh we'll just we'll just keep on moving moving right along. They set the bar for everyone

**01:10:07** else again as they do with presentations right like Apple set the bar like Steve Jobs set the

**01:10:12** bar for what a product demonstration should look like. Nobody was showing off products the way that

**01:10:18** they show off products now before Steve started doing it. Having these big stage events and

**01:10:23** there's all these slides and we're gonna and the CEO of the company is presenting to you.

**01:10:28** CEOs don't have to be presenters. CEOs only present because Steve Jobs presented because he

**01:10:33** was a very good if not the best product presenter and so then all CEOs felt like they needed to be

**01:10:39** people that present products which isn't always the best thing for the product and it changed the

**01:10:45** way that this type of stuff was done and I think that there was a lot of question about how were

**01:10:50** Apple gonna manage this and I think they have set the bar again for how you can do something like

**01:10:57** this. If you're going to try and show off your products in a similar way that you did before

**01:11:02** but now there's no audience how do you do it and they did it. The way everything was done visually

**01:11:07** was very refreshing and still worked very well. From a production perspective it was just superb.

**01:11:14** I only watched the keynotes. I started to watch the like the developers state of the union.

**01:11:20** Yeah. Yeah but I ended up abandoning it because I felt like it was more of like a rehash than

**01:11:26** than it has been in past years but I just kind of wondering because I haven't seen the rest of the

**01:11:31** videos that have come out like what is the style for all of the other sessions that have been

**01:11:36** going on like when you're watching the video about here's the details of Watchkit like what

**01:11:41** is the visual presentation for those. It's typically one or two people but not together

**01:11:47** right so they might have like one person in one location then they switch over to one person in

**01:11:51** another location but they're all shot at Apple Park with beautiful backgrounds right you're

**01:11:57** either looking out on the outside area through the windows or they're in a room which has beautiful

**01:12:02** furniture in it and it's one person presenting to the camera and when they have slides they like

**01:12:08** kind of shrink them down to a picture in picture and they have the slide and they have the person

**01:12:12** in the corner still talking and again it's like we all thought they were just going to have engineers

**01:12:17** doing zoom calls from home and they were record those right that's what people thought these

**01:12:21** sessions were going to look like but instead they found a way to produce them incredible

**01:12:27** quality they all look fantastic and they're set in such a beautiful way and there's like a weird

**01:12:32** like thing that we started to notice where they always have a table like most of them they have

**01:12:38** like a table in front of them and every person has a item on the table and they're becoming

**01:12:45** increasingly peculiar so like I've seen somebody you had a Newton like the old PDA right yeah

**01:12:53** one person had like what looked like a tiny porcelain dog another person had one of those

**01:12:59** like desktop pool tables like the tiny pool tables like they seem to be I think what I'm

**01:13:05** guessing is like these are set dressings they wanted a set dressing but it's individual to

**01:13:10** the person like bring something meaningful to you or like bring something from your desk

**01:13:15** and so like they are adding these like fun little personality items to the presentation set dressing

**01:13:20** which is really kind of peculiar but fun to see hmm it's interesting that they're in Apple Park

**01:13:27** and that if there's more than one person they're cutting between two different locations it's it's

**01:13:32** just it's funny to me because it's it's a little bit like you know I'm sure Apple can create an

**01:13:41** incredibly safe and very sterile environment if they want to but they're they're visually presenting

**01:13:48** yeah people are are separate I think they are going to a good length here to really show that

**01:13:55** they're being cautious way more than they probably are right like I said look I'm sure they are

**01:14:00** practicing social distancing there like we've seen reports that they are they have people back at the

**01:14:04** office they could have people in the same room but on either ends of a large table but they're not

**01:14:09** doing that in the main presentation it sort of struck me as funny like it was a little bit of

**01:14:14** a clean apocalypse I'm like oh in the future three people live on the Apple campus right

**01:14:21** like they they have all this space just to themselves they just struck me as as a visually

**01:14:26** funny thing that it like while it was very well done it did it did have a little bit of this like

**01:14:32** what a beautiful post-apocalypse this is because no one can be in a room with anyone else but it

**01:14:38** does make sense you know when if like you're visually deciding how do you want to show this

**01:14:42** like I would have made the same decision too it's just once you tune into it it's sort of it's sort

**01:14:46** of funny so I was interested to hear that they're continuing that aesthetic in the individual

**01:14:51** sessions it has been known throughout cortex's history that the Apple pencil was an important

**01:14:56** tool in our arsenal it was fun for me because during the keynote they were talking about how

**01:15:02** you know like some people like to use the Apple pencil to navigate their iPads and I'm like yeah

**01:15:07** yeah do you remember that when we forced you to put it back

**01:15:13** so yes you're right you're correct huge acknowledgement of of people like to navigate

**01:15:18** with their Apple pencils for sure but they've added a couple of things to this release and

**01:15:24** the biggest one for me and it is my favorite new iPadOS feature is called scribble and this is where

**01:15:33** you can use the Apple pencil to hand write in any text box and it converts it automatically to text

**01:15:40** yeah and it's fantastic have you used it yeah okay so I haven't installed any of the betas on

**01:15:45** any of my stuff again in no small part because I totally forgot about all of this but I also think

**01:15:50** this is a year where I'm going to pass on any of the betas I know I often say that but I really do

**01:15:55** think this is the year where I'm just not going to what would you do if I told you what that I am

**01:16:01** running iPadOS beta 1 and it is incredibly stable I mean that's you know that's interesting it's like

**01:16:08** do you remember how good ios 12 was it feels like that right now yeah okay nothing is broken yeah I

**01:16:14** mean cool story bro but I think I'm gonna hold off this year the scribble was the thing that immediately

**01:16:21** caught my attention and partly because you know how Apple talks about uh what are the name for

**01:16:26** those those teams that they say they have we're like oh we have a bunch of professional video

**01:16:30** editors in house and we and we spy on them while they work to see what it is the pro workflow

**01:16:34** pro workflow teams the scribble feature feels a little bit like there's a pro iPad team like

**01:16:42** a people who just use the iPad all day long and that that feels like a feature that someone picks

**01:16:49** up on of oh the people who never like to put down the pencil it's always a pain in the butt when

**01:16:55** they have to work in an actual text field and so that is a great great feature to see added and I

**01:17:01** know that that's something I'm really going to take advantage of because right now the way I've

**01:17:08** sort of gotten around it is on my iPad I have the keyboard float as like the teeny tiny floating

**01:17:14** keyboard where you can then also turn on the swipe gestures and so that's how I've always done when

**01:17:20** there's a text entry is like okay I use swipe on the tiny keyboard with the pencil and it's fine

**01:17:27** but scribble is like it is that perfect kind of Apple feature of it would never have occurred to

**01:17:32** me to request this but I'm really glad this is a feature that's that's being added and so I'm

**01:17:39** happy to hear your report that it's working well in all of the various text boxes so it works

**01:17:44** basically everywhere except applications that are doing super weird stuff of text like google docs

**01:17:49** okay right yeah well that makes sense because they have like their own complete text rendering

**01:17:54** system but any application that has a standard text entering system which is pretty much all

**01:18:00** of them you know like I'm using apps like slack and twitter and stuff and it's all working

**01:18:04** all you need to do is you just take the Apple pencil and you start handwriting and it's

**01:18:09** converting the text as you write and I have found it to be really forgiving and very accurate oh

**01:18:16** hey here's a question you have the grab hat in front of you now right yeah I do does it recognize

**01:18:22** joined up handwriting or cursive yep and you can mix interesting because that's how I write you

**01:18:27** write with cursive is that what you're saying I do both that's the crazy thing about my handwriting

**01:18:31** sometimes it's a really weird form of cursive because my handwriting is not particularly neat

**01:18:38** sometimes I write in block letters right and I mix them in the same sentence and it recognizes all of

**01:18:45** it that's pretty good that it does cursive I wouldn't have expected that I was impressed

**01:18:48** when I tested it that the writing recognition and notes will recognize cursive words which I'm

**01:18:54** always surprised at and so I figure their new like copy paste thing would probably work with

**01:18:59** cursive but I was wondering if the scribble would would let you actually write in cursive into a text

**01:19:04** box so that's that's very interesting and it does that thing that you will do with dictation

**01:19:09** where sometimes it will put a blue underline on a word which you can tap and select from other

**01:19:14** words that it think it might be if it's messed up one but then there's some other stuff so if when

**01:19:20** you're using this mode if you want to delete a word you just scribble over it and it deletes

**01:19:25** like how you would if you wanted to scribble something out because you spell it incorrectly

**01:19:30** if you want to select text you just draw a line over it or circle it and you can select the text

**01:19:36** which has been converted from handwriting to text it's so cool yeah I have to say I was I was

**01:19:43** quite impressed with a lot of the notes stuff but this is more than in notes though yeah yeah I

**01:19:48** what I was what I mean though is I was thinking of like copying the handwritten text yes that's

**01:19:54** another part of this so like there's these are two things one is you write in handwriting and

**01:19:58** it converts it to text the other is you can if you just want to do handwritten notes so they look

**01:20:04** it's written in your handwriting and you're looking at that you can then also copy that

**01:20:09** and convert it to text or you can draw like shapes and stuff and it and you can have them

**01:20:15** it's like if you draw a circle that's imperfect it can snap it to be an actual perfect circle

**01:20:20** they've done some wild stuff and any app that uses pencil kit which is like the pencil api

**01:20:27** gets all of this stuff oh interesting it's not just in notes like it's part of pencil kit yeah

**01:20:34** I assumed it was like system-wide text input stuff but I didn't realize it was baked right

**01:20:40** into pencil kit that's very interesting as always with any of these things at WWDC like

**01:20:47** you never quite know how you're going to actually use it but I like I have been very impressed with

**01:20:53** all the updates that they've done to notes over the years and with this I did find myself wondering

**01:21:00** for the first time if I would start to actually be able to use handwritten notes and things for

**01:21:08** more of like the research work that I do because I've never really used that because it's always

**01:21:14** been a pain to like get stuff out or move stuff around but it's just like it just occurred to me

**01:21:20** like oh this might be an interesting thing to try on a future video project to test this out is just

**01:21:26** is to like have a notebook like I would have had a notebook in school where it's like these are my

**01:21:33** handwritten notes like on this topic and I can I can easily get stuff out and in and move it around

**01:21:38** so it's it's really quite impressive what they've done with all of that yeah the system is it's one

**01:21:45** of those things that I can't even believe is as good as it is like they even have like if you write

**01:21:50** a phone number down it recognizes that it's a phone number and you can tap it to call I don't

**01:21:56** think I'm going to be calling people from my handwritten notes anytime soon but it's it's

**01:22:00** it's impressive that I can do that it's like it's good if you if you're a meeting person you know

**01:22:06** yeah no of course I took a lot of meetings hey give me your phone number so I can give you a call

**01:22:11** I'll write it down but Mike like the big thing is the widgets the widgets are the big thing

**01:22:17** so there's a few things going on with the home screens on iOS and iPadOS

**01:22:21** there are now widgets that look very different to the widgets we've had in the past

**01:22:25** on the iPhone you can put them anywhere on the home screen now on the iPad they still stay on

**01:22:32** the left hand side you can't put them wherever you want and these widgets are very heavily designed

**01:22:41** and they show information the best way to think of these widgets is more like Apple Watch stuff

**01:22:48** than the widgets we've had before what do you mean by that okay so you know how you have like

**01:22:52** our favorite app timery has a widget where you can tap and it will start a timer and you don't

**01:22:58** have to go into the application these new widgets do not work like that so the widgets can have no

**01:23:03** interactive buttons in them okay so they are intended to show information only and you can

**01:23:10** tap them in certain areas and it will open the application to different functions but things

**01:23:16** can't be done in the background the only widget that can do things in the background is the

**01:23:21** shortcuts widget oh okay okay all right so that's interesting though so then that means like

**01:23:27** this is a totally different category of widget yes so like on my iPhone one of the widgets that

**01:23:35** I have is the OmniFocus widget yep and I can check off to-do items from that widget but that would

**01:23:42** not be possible under the new system it could display like oh here's your top two items or

**01:23:48** whatever but if I were to tap on it it then has to open the OmniFocus app yes huh that's kind of

**01:23:54** that's kind of a pain for developers like now they have yet another thing that's a little bit

**01:23:58** different yeah okay especially because the the old widget type has been deprecated so you can

**01:24:05** still run them but and then they'll longer officially supported so developers are being

**01:24:11** encouraged to leave their old widgets behind basically and make new ones oh okay so they're

**01:24:16** taking away my old widgets they're not yet not yet I think like uh many of us think now that like

**01:24:23** maybe next year there'll be buttons yeah that makes sense but this year no buttons that would

**01:24:28** make sense so basically we're going into new territory with these widgets and we'll have

**01:24:34** more interesting things going on because our home screens will now be able to show us information

**01:24:41** but we won't be able to get the interactivity out of them for me I feel like this is a fine

**01:24:46** trade-off to begin yeah yeah I mean look I'm happy for anything at all to happen with a

**01:24:52** redesign of the iPhone in particular home screen yeah which has been yeah mostly completely

**01:24:58** useless to me for years anyway so even without the buttons I'm happy to be entering a new widgety

**01:25:04** world and to be able to explore options with that because the the home screen for me has just been

**01:25:10** a dead blank rectangle of uselessness for years and so I'm interested to see how the widgets go

**01:25:17** and please stop if you're standing feedback now to tell us that Android's been doing like we know

**01:25:22** that Android has widgets you don't need to tell us the same as what I'm about to say I know Android

**01:25:27** does this and I'm now very happy that it's coming to iOS which is what Apple calling app library

**01:25:33** which is a list of applications in two different ways they categorize them for you and you can

**01:25:40** also get an alphabet alphabetized list of all the applications that you have installed

**01:25:45** and you can now remove the extra home screens that you don't want anymore

**01:25:50** I cannot wait to do our first home screens episode after iOS 14 ships

**01:25:57** because our home screens are gonna look nothing like they did before like I just expect your home

**01:26:02** screen will have no apps on it anymore and just widgets because you'll be able to do that and if

**01:26:07** you want the apps you can either search for them the way you always have before or you can swipe

**01:26:11** over to the app library they're categorized and also alphabetized so I'm really happy about this

**01:26:17** because I only want to have one home screen now like and I've wanted that for a while everything

**01:26:22** else is basically just in folders and then I installed another app and then it's like oh now

**01:26:26** I have a third screen what app do I need to move I'm not sure I will be super happy to have one

**01:26:32** home screen with less app icons on it some widgets on there maybe a second screen that just has more

**01:26:38** widgets but all of my app icons are all hidden away in the lists that I don't need to maintain

**01:26:44** anymore I am very much looking forward to that I have one more question that occurred to me about

**01:26:48** the widget which you may or may not have the answer to but I'm thinking like what is the situation now

**01:26:54** with the lock screen and widgets so like on your phone you can access the old style widgets by

**01:27:01** sliding over like is that basically unchanged currently I believe so I mean you could still

**01:27:08** do that on the iPad I'm not running iOS 14 on my iPhone right right but my expectation is that you

**01:27:15** can still get to some form of widgets there too and you can have multiple instances of a widget

**01:27:23** so I have two shortcuts widgets in my widgets on my iPad the reason I'm doing this is this is how

**01:27:30** I'm going to get around the fact that in the future my beloved timer your widget won't work

**01:27:34** I'm going to create a set of timer shortcuts that I access through the widget and when I assume

**01:27:43** there will be a timer a widget that shows like information about the timers that I'm running

**01:27:48** which I'm assuming they will probably try and do something like that because you can drop widgets

**01:27:52** on top of each other right so I will have like a time tracking widget stack where I will see

**01:27:58** one widget will be the timer a widget and I can swipe to the other one and press the buttons that

**01:28:02** I want and they just run the shortcuts in the background ah oh it's clever that's a clever idea

**01:28:07** so I'll hide the buttons like the shortcuts related to the other widget behind it right to swipe

**01:28:14** tap it swipe back yeah no that makes sense that's good that's a really good idea this episode of

**01:30:23** talk about shortcuts because gray there's so much and you probably don't know it because they did

**01:30:29** put it in the keynote my overall perception of the WWDC was a little bit of oh nice you know like nice

**01:30:37** nothing super exciting but a bunch of welcome improvements particularly to maps as well i'm

**01:30:42** always happy about the the map section which i'm just gonna assume when the map spot was happening

**01:30:49** i was like oh snoozefest like i just wasn't paying attention at all how dare you i was like

**01:30:55** megg frost is my girl like tell me about maps like oh this is great cycle directions fantastic

**01:31:01** this guides clearly yet more hints at your ar program like yeah i know the map section i was

**01:31:06** like great um tell me tell me everything that you can but like but so generally over like the whole

**01:31:12** thing i just felt like oh this is nice like a bunch of nice improvements but nothing nothing

**01:31:15** sort of super exciting but it felt like okay you know maybe they'll iron out some bugs and we'll

**01:31:20** have a nice stable year and it did only occur to me afterward that i was like was there anything

**01:31:27** about shortcuts and i don't think there was in the actual presentation itself so i i know nothing

**01:31:32** about this please tell me the exciting things for automation that's coming down the line here

**01:31:37** the app has been redesigned in that it has this new ipad kind of design style which includes

**01:31:44** sidebars and toolbars and stuff like they look closer to the new mac os design so now we have

**01:31:51** sidebars on the side which adds four folders oh thank god and you can create widgets from shortcuts

**01:32:01** in folders so you can have multiple widgets that relate to folders hmm right so basically there's

**01:32:07** new ways of categorizing things and they're they're called folders but really they're just

**01:32:12** sections in a sidebar you know yeah but whatever i'll i'll take it but it's organization right like

**01:32:17** any is good currently for all of my timers i've i've ended up having to name them all like t colon

**01:32:26** space and then whatever the name is for the actual timer just to try to like have some way

**01:32:30** to search for just those and it's like it's been such a nightmare trying to have any level of

**01:32:36** organization for shortcuts so if that was the only feature added to shortcuts i would be thrilled

**01:32:45** they've added multi-window support oh nice so you can have two versions of the shortcuts app side

**01:32:51** by side which can help with dragging and dropping and stuff in the shortcuts builder you can now

**01:32:58** copy and paste actions fantastic right so needed fantastic but then my friend they have done some

**01:33:08** wild stuff to automation of shortcuts okay please tell me okay so they've added in a bunch of new

**01:33:17** automation triggers so there are new kind of things that can trigger off an automation

**01:33:22** mm-hmm so before we had stuff like time of day and all that kind of stuff right right and when

**01:33:29** you open an app you can run a shortcut there is now email a message automation triggers so

**01:33:38** when i get a message from this person or when i get a message from this person that includes

**01:33:47** the following phrase run this shortcut or an email that contains a subject or to any account

**01:33:59** an account that i choose recipient that i choose run this shortcut with the real key now being

**01:34:09** that you can run automations without you needing to approve them oh thank god yes okay all right

**01:34:19** because it's like you're telling me there's new triggers and it's like great great but like my

**01:34:22** disappointment last year was tremendous when like we have all of these triggers but you still need

**01:34:28** to manually confirm each time completely negating all of the value of the thing that is fantastic

**01:34:37** i cannot believe that they can run without user interaction so the new ones in total are when i

**01:34:43** get an email when i get a message when an app is closed when a battery level is reached when i

**01:34:50** attach my phone to a charger and then there are also some shortcuts that can be set off from the

**01:34:55** new sleep actions that they have which tie in with the apple watch now there are also a selection of

**01:35:02** automations that you can run without there needing to be input unfortunately one that is absent from

**01:35:07** this list is location change which i know is a frustration for you because like that i know that

**01:35:12** was when you really wanted but not a problem right now so you can probably let that one go for a bit

**01:35:18** it's not a problem right now and and if you can have something run at time of day like you can

**01:35:23** get around the location change like there's ways to fix that if you can have stuff run without

**01:35:28** you manually needing to check it i will say for the moment i'm not sure if the when i get an email

**01:35:35** or when i get a message runs without your input i'm not 100 sure about that but i do have a definite

**01:35:41** list of ones that can be triggered okay can time of day run without input yes great that solves

**01:35:47** every problem so this is the list that i know run without input includes at time of day when an

**01:35:53** alarm is set when the sleep mode starts when you begin a workout when you have car play related

**01:35:58** stuff put your phone into airplane mode touch an nfc trigger put into do not disturb when low power

**01:36:05** mode turns on when you open an app when you close an app when you reach a certain battery level or

**01:36:09** attach your phone to a charger great so you still get a notification but you don't have to confirm

**01:36:14** it yeah as long as you don't have to confirm it that's great i i can live with notification clutter

**01:36:19** from one app if if it can run things automatically isn't it cool that is amazing yeah and i have to

**01:36:25** say i'm a little surprised because i i wasn't there was a part of me that thought for security reasons

**01:36:33** apple would never allow that stuff to run without a user confirmation so i'm really glad that they've

**01:36:38** allowed it to run automatically because like i said last year i felt sort of frustrated of like

**01:36:44** all of the stuff that i wanted to do at least from my own personal use cases i found it more

**01:36:49** annoying than to just not bother because i had to tap stuff so as a huge huge huge improvement i'm

**01:36:55** really excited about that yeah the sheer level of stuff that they've put into shortcuts this year is

**01:37:00** is mind boggling honestly like so other stuff that they've done you can now run shortcuts from the new

**01:37:07** search so like the search that looks like spotlight and can run them without ever opening the

**01:37:13** application even if it needs an interaction from the search menu nice and all of the ui now when

**01:37:20** you're running a shortcut just looks like notifications even when you use them from the

**01:37:25** widget they look like notifications so it's like a whole new ui that's running and there are new

**01:37:31** actions for the apple watch so you could automatically at a time of day have your watch face change

**01:37:39** oh great that's amazing right i feel like yeah watch face changes that's oh boy that's really

**01:37:47** interesting that they've done it in shortcuts like that makes sense actually i never would have

**01:37:51** thought to put it there but that's oh man that is great i i am going to to use that for sure

**01:37:59** and also there is now shortcut support on the apple watch oh right yeah because they used to

**01:38:03** have a complication for shortcuts back when it was workflow they used to have an app too so now

**01:38:09** you can run them from an app or you can set them as complications nice and one of the great things

**01:38:15** about the new watch os 7 is there are a bunch of different tweaks to the watch faces where you can

**01:38:22** now have multiple complications from the same application yes on a watch face i think is the

**01:38:28** biggest the biggest deal and like a frustration i have run into numerous times the two apps in

**01:38:35** particular for me were always carrot weather sometimes i wanted two different complications

**01:38:39** from carrot weather and of course watch smith by our friend underscore david smith was another one

**01:38:46** of these like a lot of great little complications and the ability to use multiple complications

**01:38:51** from that on one watch face is really nice that is a very welcome improvement in watch os 7 so the

**01:38:57** apple watch stuff they are included in the automations part of shortcuts it's kind of amazing

**01:39:04** that you can now set it up that you can like turn on theater mode and silent mode at certain times

**01:39:11** or you can change to different watch faces that you want at certain times so you would be able to

**01:39:18** i guess like when you start a workout maybe you could set your workout watch face or something

**01:39:25** like this is really cool that they've done a lot of this stuff it really is very surprising because

**01:39:32** we've seen a lot of improvements to shortcuts over the time that apple has has had it under

**01:39:39** stewardship but they've been a lot of stuff where it's like a thing you think you've got a thing but

**01:39:46** you don't actually have that thing yes yes and it feels like this year they've given us a lot of the

**01:39:53** things that we thought we had that is a really good way to put it yeah because yeah like last

**01:39:57** year i felt like oh you didn't really give me what i thought you were giving me the watch faces

**01:40:02** in shortcuts is interesting because that also feels like another way that shortcuts is becoming

**01:40:12** the core tool for power users for the whole system instead of having something in the watch app

**01:40:19** which says oh at this time change the watch face to this other thing which i would have been thrilled

**01:40:25** just to get that but the option to be able to change the faces through other kinds of arbitrary

**01:40:31** shortcuts and automations is is way more powerful and so it's it's really nice to see that in the

**01:40:38** in the shortcuts app and and yeah that is really interesting like this is this is the most

**01:40:44** interesting stuff that i would have wanted in the in the keynote like i would have been way more

**01:40:48** pumped if this section was in the keynote it's only for people like us though right no like look

**01:40:54** look here's what the wwdc keynote should have part one maps part two automation part three

**01:41:03** new apple watch faces the end right no one else wants anything that's that's all anybody's looking

**01:41:09** for talking more about the apple watch and they've added some sleep tracking stuff into the apple

**01:41:15** watch which is cool and they have like kind of wind down and wake up type features like reminding

**01:41:22** you to charge i've seen people saying that like it's very basic sleep tracking which is kind of

**01:41:28** what you would expect apple to do and then if you want more use an application that's doing a lot

**01:41:32** more tracking yeah it's nice to have yeah it's nice to have and the one little part of that that

**01:41:37** i i also really liked was the option to have the silent wake up alarm yeah yeah i think like that's

**01:41:45** that's really nice that that's always been a thing that like i can get that to work with some other

**01:41:50** apps but it's really nice that that's just to like just wake the one person up you don't need

**01:41:55** to wake up everyone if there's multiple people uh so yeah i'm glad that they have the silent alarm

**01:42:00** for waking up as well i'm curious because my bet is that introducing sleep tracking is also an

**01:42:08** indicator that the next version of the watch is going to have another like quantum leap with the

**01:42:13** battery like that's that's my guess anyway well i'll see they're doing this i would hope so because

**01:42:18** they are gonna have a bigger battery for next time around i have to say like there's a bunch

**01:42:22** of other stuff in the keynote this year there's a lot and there's a lot i think that we're gonna

**01:42:27** get to later in the year yeah yeah as different things start coming out the new mac os looks

**01:42:33** interesting yeah there's another another uh big architecture transition on the horizon which will

**01:42:39** uh which will be interesting i think i'll be trying to hold out any computer purchases until

**01:42:44** after then oh i know right yeah like i remember that happening last time as well of like when i

**01:42:52** heard it was coming like no more macs for me until after this transition i had been weighing up if i

**01:42:58** wanted to replace my macbook pro i am not doing that right like i will wait now because it's very

**01:43:05** possible that some wild arm based laptop is on the horizon yeah yeah i think that's extremely

**01:43:12** likely so yeah there's much more stuff in here and i think we'll talk about some of those things

**01:43:16** as as they come up but i do have to say for me as someone who forgot the wwtc was happening this

**01:43:23** week i can say that i have greatly benefited from all of the work that you have done this week yeah
