# Cortex - 114: The Garden of #AskCortex
**00:00:00** Quiet on set. I'm ready to go quiet on set

**00:00:05** No, I just turned off the few machines that make noise in this office

**00:00:10** I was like, it's quiet. It's quiet on set quiet everyone time to record except ever even how you say anything close to that

**00:00:18** Lights camera action

**00:00:22** Yeah, that's it that's it we're rolling

**00:00:25** How you doing Mike good I have some follow-up for you. Oh, yeah follow up about your sleep people were very interested

**00:00:39** Said it many times before you never really know what people are gonna latch on to

**00:00:45** But oh boy the people in especially on reddit latch on to my sleep patterns

**00:00:50** Everyone was very concerned Mike. Everyone was very concerned for you. I'm just happy we have so many medical professionals in our audience

**00:00:57** Who knew I wanna just follow up on something

**00:01:01** I mean you can people can take from this what they wish surprise surprise. There was a bug with the data

**00:01:06** Oh, okay. Very surprising. I appear to not have had 240 alarms in a week

**00:01:11** Because when I checked it a couple of days ago that exact same week the 8th to the 15th of March

**00:01:17** It said 84 which is a significant difference to 240 or whatever the number was

**00:01:22** Mm-hmm. So basically all I want to say is yeah, I do have a lot of alarms every day

**00:01:27** It's nowhere near the amount it seems that was originally reported still seems like a lot

**00:01:32** It is a lot it is a lot but I've been thinking about it like I over set alarms

**00:01:36** I don't need as many alarms on as I have because what tends to happen for me gray

**00:01:40** Because if you have like a bunch of alarms set like me, I have one ten minute intervals. That's like the snooze interval

**00:01:46** So what usually happens is I get like four alarms at once and just dismiss them all because you've snoozed them

**00:01:52** And so they're overlapping. Is that what you're saying? Yeah. Oh, okay. Why don't you just snooze the one alarm right?

**00:01:58** But because now it's this is what it's saying. I've got two things going on here

**00:02:01** I'm sure this this isn't gonna make my case any better. But here we are minute now. I'm in it now

**00:02:06** Like I can feel everyone hands hovering above the keyboard. I

**00:02:11** Set a lot of alarms and I snooze them all right and I thought to myself

**00:02:15** well, I could just set one alarm and just snooze it a bunch of times, but my

**00:02:20** neuroses

**00:02:21** Won't allow for that because what if I turn off the alarm rather than snooze it and now I've slept through the whole day

**00:02:28** That is fair. It's very easy to do. It's very easy to accidentally hit the stop alarm versus snooze alarm

**00:02:35** So I think that that's a reasonable concern. I give myself an hour, right?

**00:02:39** That is the agreement. I've made by myself, right?

**00:02:42** I have one hour from the first alarm until I wake up

**00:02:46** I can get up anytime within that hour and I do sometimes it's only two or three alarms and I'm up

**00:02:52** Oh very impressive. Sometimes it's ten less impressive. Give myself the best part of an hour and

**00:02:59** My alarms will just keep going off until then that's just where I am

**00:03:02** I

**00:03:05** Do have some good I think objectively good follow-up though

**00:03:09** Okay, I set a 30 minute daily time limit on Twitter. Oh very good

**00:03:15** I just thought to myself why don't I do this, you know, like you want to spend less time on it

**00:03:19** I've just spent two hours talking about a system that is supposed to do this

**00:03:24** So that's what I've been doing and obviously I've been keeping to it

**00:03:27** There's been a day or two where I gave myself a little bit of extra time

**00:03:30** Mmm, but now like I'm down to like two and a bit hours a week down from like four hours

**00:03:36** So you're getting the the screen comes down when your time is up and it says no more Twitter for you

**00:03:42** And then it's like you can ignore it for the day. I like one more minute. That's my favorite

**00:03:46** This is funny to me that that's like just hate just one more minute

**00:03:50** Come on one more minute, please the one more minute does make me smile because it always makes me feel like a child when I press it

**00:03:55** Right that I'm I'm asking for from my parents for wonderful. Yeah

**00:04:00** And I know this isn't the case

**00:04:01** But it feels a little bit like it's a hangover from the days when we used to have to save files or something like no

**00:04:07** You don't understand. I just I just need one more minute to press a couple buttons wrap something up

**00:04:11** There is something useful in that though, because usually when I hit that I was doing something

**00:04:16** Right, and I just want to finish the thing that I was doing

**00:04:19** Because I've been like composing a tweet like a publisher show putting a tweet out and then like the thing pops up

**00:04:25** And I'm like, I just need one more minute. I was like halfway through something here

**00:04:29** What what I do appreciate about Apple system is it like it tracks me everywhere, right even on the web?

**00:04:36** So I like that. I think it's smart that they know right I forget

**00:04:38** I forget that they did do that that they have their different way of

**00:04:42** Recognizing that this is all the same service as Twitter that that is a good feature for all of the complaining that we've done

**00:04:47** That is a good feature and it's just been really interesting to me to like just take kind of mental stock of what time of the

**00:04:53** Day, I'm hitting the 30 minutes

**00:04:55** Like some days it's not even lunchtime. Some days. I don't see it all. I'm just I've still got a lot to learn about

**00:05:01** Myself from this. I've only been doing it for like a week and a half

**00:05:04** But I actually think it might be the right move for me. Yeah, no, I think that's great

**00:05:07** I'm glad to hear that you're doing that and that it's working for you

**00:05:10** Like again, this is this is the promise of the system is to try to bring in alignment

**00:05:16** What sitting down?

**00:05:18** Rational you wants you to do and then what in the moment you wants to do which getting those things into alignment

**00:05:26** It's not always it's not always as as easy as we wish it would be no

**00:05:30** So I'm basically making my computer shame me which I'm fine with yeah, it's in the privacy of your own home. Yeah, whatever

**00:05:38** You punch you today you're sleepy that's why yeah, this is this is this is gray on five hours of sleep

**00:05:46** Yeah, yeah, we are recording this the day after you published a video

**00:05:51** It turns out that drinking coffee at 10 p.m. To do a director's commentary

**00:05:57** It's not a great recipe for a good night's good night's sleep. So that decision that like late night coffee decision

**00:06:04** It's just killer, you know, it happens to me a few times a year as well, right?

**00:06:08** All right. I've got a thing and I just got to do it

**00:06:11** I have no other way around this and I know the only way I'm gonna get through it is I need that little extra

**00:06:17** And if I but if I do this

**00:06:19** Everything afterwards is worse. Well

**00:06:23** I'm sorry, but this is how I'm going. So yeah, it's like this. This is what the drugs are for sometimes, right?

**00:06:29** I was like, well, we're gonna inject myself with this and keep going and pay for it later

**00:06:34** And now is later

**00:06:37** Great. I have some good news for you today

**00:06:39** Mm-hmm. I had asked our audience for some ask cortex questions

**00:06:42** I like to touch on these every now and then and I know that for you these episodes are easier on you which is good

**00:06:49** Thank You Mike gonna hold my hand and we're gonna we're gonna take you through the show today

**00:06:53** Oh, you're leading me through the garden of ask cortex. That's delightful. It's also it's been a while

**00:06:58** So he has in the ask cortex garden

**00:07:00** So I'm very happy to be here on a sleepy Saturday afternoon

**00:07:03** Although to be honest, the first question is kind of a big one. I apologize flat asks

**00:07:08** What do you think the state of the workplace will be after the pandemic? Oh, that's that's I mean, that's not a big question at all

**00:07:13** But I mean it though. Okay, it'll be the same. That's the answer. I think everyone's dramatically

**00:07:18** overestimating this

**00:07:20** Okay, why convince me corporations have now realized how much money they could save I'm not sold

**00:07:26** I'm not sold on this argument, but go on tell me more. This is a little bit informed by some conversations

**00:07:32** I've been having with people that work in large businesses

**00:07:35** So intriguing that there are lots of companies who have let some of their workspace go

**00:07:42** Mm-hmm, and there are also companies that are realizing that now some of their employees have had that sweet taste of working from home

**00:07:49** Life and won't want to give it up. Mm-hmm

**00:07:51** So I do think that for a lot of companies not all but for a lot of companies

**00:07:56** The workplace is going to be different. There is going to be more remote working

**00:08:00** There is going to be less office space in general

**00:08:03** There will be lots of businesses that will return just as normal right no doubt about it

**00:08:08** But I believe that there will be lots of businesses that will reduce the amount of people that they have coming in

**00:08:14** So we'll have to change the way that the workplace is set up to have more collaborative space

**00:08:19** More meeting spaces and stuff like that for the people that just drop it in for the day

**00:08:24** Mm-hmm. I think there's gonna be a lot of that

**00:08:26** So like there's some companies that I know in the UK large companies media companies that are looking at this as their approach now

**00:08:33** Hmm the saving money thing man

**00:08:35** It's a real deal and also as well

**00:08:37** I was a lot of technology companies like American technology companies

**00:08:40** But if they said that like we now have a completely do what you want remote working policy forever

**00:08:46** Which just wasn't a thing that existed before for a lot of these organizations. Yeah. Yeah. Okay

**00:08:51** so the saving money thing that obviously that's that's a good argument I just

**00:08:58** I'm not convinced it'll hold over the long run and

**00:09:02** Like my suspicion is this is also just partly about the way humans are and

**00:09:07** I think that as the pandemic recedes into distant memory

**00:09:13** You're going to have the same phenomenon where?

**00:09:16** Managers want their direct reports in a building around them butts on seats

**00:09:22** Yeah, butts on seats and I think the internal company politics of that

**00:09:28** You know look at this tiny kingdom I oversee and the people who report to me and I'm so busy

**00:09:35** Interrupting them all day from getting their work done as a manager

**00:09:38** I just think that's a that's a strong irrational pull that I just expect will return and will come back

**00:09:48** It's a little bit like I've been talking to some people who are convinced about oh

**00:09:52** There's going to be so many people who are living out in the country and cities are going to experience

**00:09:58** Depopulation it's like I know there's a reason that people go to city people

**00:10:03** Don't just live in cities because there's job opportunities in cities like this. There's many reasons

**00:10:07** It's not an accident and like the gravitational pull of cities is like yeah, sure. It's been loosened

**00:10:13** but I'm pretty sure that if we draw a graph of

**00:10:17** City populations going ten years back in ten years in the future

**00:10:22** It'll be hard to even see the pandemic on that graph, you know for having any kind of impact

**00:10:26** So I don't know. I hope that you are right. I think that's

**00:10:30** Homeworking for people who can swing it is a much better situation. Well

**00:10:36** What's that? Well, so there's another part of this which so I have painted the rosy picture for many people

**00:10:43** But you brought up company politics

**00:10:45** So there is gonna have to be a lot of change in the way that companies operate

**00:10:50** And I think I could see there being an initial change and then a like a bounce back from it a little bit

**00:10:56** Because if some people are in the office sort of time some people aren't what is the relationship change for those people?

**00:11:04** like if there are six people in a team and

**00:11:07** Five of them are in the office and then there's one person that works remote

**00:11:10** Does anybody remember the remote person do they end up feeling left out and then also what if certain managers, you know

**00:11:17** They just promote the people they see all the time

**00:11:20** Like so companies that aren't used to this or companies that don't fully embrace it

**00:11:24** But just have it as a thing you can do if they have to go through the the the culture change, honestly

**00:11:32** That's not good at culture change

**00:11:35** It is no

**00:11:36** I'm saying that things are different but but what will not happen is that there's going to be some kind of culture change

**00:11:43** We're yeah, we're oh we we hear our culture here is to go completely against the human grain of

**00:11:50** Who you're talking to and scheming about, you know at the water cooler

**00:11:55** We're going to treat the people who are remote in their cabins in Montana as equal players in

**00:12:02** This game of monkey politics of getting you know one up on the other person

**00:12:06** It's like there's no way that's gonna go away. So this is this is partly what I mean

**00:12:10** Like the gravitational pull of an office is just too strong if you're going to work remote

**00:12:17** I think you just have to accept that part of the deal in that is you are

**00:12:23** not going to be promoted as frequently you are not going to be thought about as much and

**00:12:29** That's why I say for people who can swing it like for some people

**00:12:33** That's great

**00:12:34** You know like that's a plus not a minus but for many people like they don't want to have a job where they are

**00:12:40** Forgotten and never promoted. So this is why I think you're making a case for why people will end up

**00:12:46** Back in the office over the long run even if it like saves a company money

**00:12:51** Oh, I see the point that I'm making is I think there are two things that will happen

**00:12:55** I think there will be a change and then there will be another one

**00:12:59** And I think the place that will end up at there will be more people that work remotely than they did prior to the pandemic

**00:13:05** But it is not going to be at the numbers that a lot of people think which is hey this worked fine

**00:13:10** Yeah, this worked fine because you will all remote. So unless your workplace goes all remote, it's not gonna be like this

**00:13:17** Yeah, when people start going back to the office, you're gonna see a different result to how it's been for the last year

**00:13:24** Yeah, I think for companies. It's like all remote or nothing is like the two optimal solutions

**00:13:30** I'm trying to remember what does it think? It's WordPress

**00:13:33** Like that they're an entirely remote company with a huge number of people and it's like yeah

**00:13:39** You can make it work if everyone is remote and then that does

**00:13:43** Mitigate the in-person politics stuff but half remote half there. There's always going to be an advantage

**00:13:49** inside the company for the people who are physically present so

**00:13:53** We'll see but I don't expect much change in person meetings

**00:13:59** Handshakes, they're all coming back, baby. They're all coming back. They're gonna come back with a vengeance to

**00:14:06** Handshakes will last a full 25 seconds. Yeah, there are people are gonna be so happy to do handshakes

**00:14:11** They're gonna do that aggressive two-handed handshake, right? We're getting

**00:14:15** Yeah, I've completely enclosed your hand in my hand for this shaking

**00:14:21** The handshake is gonna be hand to make sure all all of the surface

**00:14:27** Contact that's possible all of the germ transfer that could happen. It's gonna happen

**00:14:31** This episode of cortex is brought to you by Microsoft lists your smart information tracking app in Microsoft 365

**00:14:39** Keeping track of information is something that is in everybody's job description

**00:14:43** Quite simply writing things down is what works for simple lists

**00:14:47** But it can get overwhelming when you need to stay on top of hundreds of items and get others to pay attention and act on them

**00:14:54** Microsoft lists is a Microsoft 365 app that helps you easily track information and organize your work

**00:15:01** Lists are simple smart and flexible so you can stay on top of what matters most to your team track issues

**00:15:06** assets routines contacts inventory and more using

**00:15:11** Customizable views and smart rules and alerts to keep everyone in sync with ready-made templates

**00:15:16** You can quickly start lists online on the new mobile app for iOS and directly within Microsoft Teams

**00:15:23** Because it's part of Microsoft 365 you can rely on enterprise ready security and compliance

**00:15:29** I was trying out Microsoft lists myself and it is so easy to create a list and they have these really great

**00:15:35** Templates like you could create a content plan for your blog or an inventory of the tech at your office

**00:15:40** Everything is laid out really simply super easy to understand and fast

**00:15:45** If you're setting up a new list from scratch

**00:15:47** They have great tools to help you create the entries like you can choose from entering text to images

**00:15:52** Maybe yes or no questions multiple choice tons of great data input options

**00:15:56** That will be awesome for when you're putting in stuff later on and they also have automation built-in

**00:16:01** So for example, if an item is marked as complete it could fire off an email to someone

**00:16:06** Super useful when working in a large team

**00:16:09** Your list just got a whole lot smarter get more done with Microsoft lists go to

**00:16:16** aka.ms

**00:16:17** MS lists for more information

**00:16:19** videos demos blogs and more that is aka

**00:16:23** MS

**00:16:25** MS lists make a list and let it flow our thanks to Microsoft lists for their support of this show and relay FM

**00:16:32** Betty asks for busy people who get hundreds of actionable emails a day

**00:16:36** How do you say on top of it when your full-time job is not dealing with your email Mike?

**00:16:41** Would you like to wish like to answer this question?

**00:16:43** So I wondered if you I mean there was there was a time in your life where you did have to deal with the email

**00:16:49** That you got like maybe before you were a youtuber when you were teaching a lot of emails a teacher

**00:16:55** Yeah, I got hundreds of emails as a teacher

**00:16:57** I mean, but this is why my answer is probably not helpful because my answer would be along the lines of

**00:17:04** Yeah, when I was a teacher the name of the game was

**00:17:08** try to figure out what's really

**00:17:11** actionable as in which of these things will cause me problems and

**00:17:16** everything else that is

**00:17:18** actionable now becomes actionable with a bunch of air quotes around it, you know and for me the real answer there was like

**00:17:26** Brutal triage of I only care about the things that are going to cause me problems

**00:17:31** But I don't think that's generally good advice, you know, I was in a very particular situation at the time

**00:17:37** So that's why I think whatever you have to say is gonna be much more valuable than what I had

**00:17:46** Okay, the thing not all actionable email actually requires action, okay in my corporate job, I got more email than I get now

**00:17:54** Everything was done by email and everybody thought they needed the answer, right?

**00:17:59** This is isn't part of the problem actionable email a lot of it

**00:18:03** It's just people think they need it to be actioned by you more than you need to action that email

**00:18:08** so what I would say is for anybody who is

**00:18:12** Finding this happened to them and it's new you have to do a bit of training on yourself over time of trying to work out

**00:18:20** what is the stuff that truly requires your attention and

**00:18:24** Learning over time the things that you're able to just ignore and see if they come back

**00:18:30** Mm-hmm. Like that's the real thing that

**00:18:34** Everyone I think ultimately learns who's in this position

**00:18:37** Like what are the actual real?

**00:18:41** Requirements or what are the real things that need my attention?

**00:18:44** And what are the things that will just naturally go away if I ignore them? This is not quote actionable advice

**00:18:52** But it's just a thing that that is the only way to deal with this. I will tell you it always feels like

**00:18:58** There is more on the line than there is a lot of the time

**00:19:01** And I have found like gray has found that you can kind of let some stuff go and it will just

**00:19:08** Disappear the person forgot about it, right? Yeah again

**00:19:11** I think my bad dial is turned up slightly here where it's not not even things that would go away

**00:19:18** But stuff was like I can take the negative consequences of that

**00:19:22** Like that's fine

**00:19:23** But a bad thing that's part of the risk factor of trying to decide what needs to go away

**00:19:28** If someone might say to you like this is unacceptable

**00:19:30** Why we not replied and then you need to reply right like what are you gonna do right then you stumble around?

**00:19:35** Oh, I was so busy. So sorry. I missed it. I never got your email

**00:19:40** We have your read receipt right here

**00:19:42** Yeah, this is a really tricky one

**00:19:48** But it is ultimately something you need to remember that for most people

**00:19:52** Your job isn't answering email your job is doing your job and you've got to try and find that balance for yourself

**00:19:59** One of the ways that actually really helped me get out of this was I for a while decided

**00:20:04** I was only gonna check email for half an hour twice a day

**00:20:07** And if you're setting that kind of hard limit on yourself and you get lost and lots of email

**00:20:11** You'd be surprised how quickly you start to realize what you need to respond to

**00:20:16** If you limit the amount of time that you actually have to spend on it because it's gonna keep building up

**00:20:20** Then you start to build your own filter of what can just be removed

**00:20:23** What could be filed away for later that kind of stuff? Mm-hmm. It's tricky. Yeah. No, it's totally tricky

**00:20:29** this also just kind of goes back to the previous question a little bit and our recurring fascination with big companies and the

**00:20:39** What is everybody doing here kind of question?

**00:20:42** And I just remember thinking that a lot when I got a whole bunch of teacher emails is

**00:20:47** It's like how you log in and there's 200 messages all of which are supposedly

**00:20:51** requesting something from you and just just having that experience of

**00:20:55** What are all of these people who send these emails doing like I like I'm not replying to them

**00:20:59** I suspect a lot of other people are also playing the same game that I'm playing like there's a lot of like turbulent flow in

**00:21:05** bigger

**00:21:07** Organizations, I think where the water is

**00:21:10** Fighting itself as it's flowing through the pipe and there's a lot of unnecessary motion

**00:21:15** And you just want to stay away from that like you answer a bunch of emails and you just train other people

**00:21:21** That you are part of this world of people who are sending emails back and forth all day long and that can quickly spiral up

**00:21:28** into a lot of busyness that accomplishes just absolutely nothing in terms of the

**00:21:34** real hard

**00:21:36** valuable things that need to get done any day now slack's gonna say is from email any day any day any day now

**00:21:45** You probably missed this but they had a horrific day trying to set up this like a

**00:21:52** system that

**00:21:54** Anyone can DM you from any slack organization if they have your email address. Oh, here we go

**00:22:00** This is the slack wants to be discord phenomenon great

**00:22:05** Every company just wants to be every other company can slack be Instagram can LinkedIn be YouTube

**00:22:13** Have you seen they announced this a while ago that slack is creating stories are you for real?

**00:22:17** I'm being serious. It almost looks like an April Fool's joke, but they're working on it stories slack stories

**00:22:22** That's I mean that would sound like an April Fool's it really when I saw it

**00:22:26** I I genuinely checked like is this an old story, but no it's a real thing that they are apparently working on

**00:22:33** But they created this system of like, you know

**00:22:35** Oh, you'll be able to basically want to be like that the work chat app, right?

**00:22:39** So great industries could talk to really FM people inside of those companies

**00:22:45** You just got to know the email address that's associated with the slack

**00:22:48** and it was one of those like just typical catastrophe type things where they put this out there and then

**00:22:55** They just got a ton of pushback because so say you wanted to contact me and you knew my email address, right?

**00:23:01** And you would open up in slack when you send the invite to me. You could say whatever you wanted in the invite

**00:23:06** Oh, so I'm sending you an email. That's what this is

**00:23:11** Email or into slack, right? But the problem is you could say whatever you wanted to me

**00:23:17** So like from a harassment perspective

**00:23:20** You can't stop these emails coming and you can say whenever you want. It's worse than email

**00:23:30** Now you just can't customize the invite but you can still send the invite so they're moving down this path

**00:23:36** This is them trying to I guess this is more of the push towards getting rid of email and just like

**00:23:43** That is that is an amazing full circle though of we won't be email. Oh, it's worse than email

**00:23:49** And I just I love all of the companies trying to be all of the new hotness

**00:23:54** When can I clubhouse from Google Docs Mike? That's what I want to know

**00:24:00** It's probably not that far away

**00:24:04** Dylan asks how many iPads to the two of you currently have in rotation and what are their purposes?

**00:24:09** What's your iPad in lockdown situation? It's all change

**00:24:15** Really? Mmm. So like I wasn't used I haven't really used one for months

**00:24:23** Mm-hmm. I actually just changed like in the last couple of weeks. I think it was after we recorded last you referenced couch iPad

**00:24:31** Mm-hmm, and I thought oh I should do that. So like my 11 inch iPad Pro now lives on the couch and

**00:24:38** That's where I read my news and I give them just hanging out on the couch

**00:24:41** That's what I use now instead of my phone and I find that to just be much more comfortable

**00:24:46** Oh my god, if you're using your phone on the couch, that's awful. No couchpad best pad

**00:24:51** I've never really thought of it that way because for so long my iPad has been my work device, right?

**00:24:57** Now I am a hundred percent working on the Mac. This is what lockdown did to me

**00:25:02** Mmm, just been a complete 180 plus the new max is so good and I like the new Mac OS and

**00:25:08** So I've just basically transitioned completely to working on the Mac again. So my

**00:25:14** Big iPad Pro has been in the studio in a drawer

**00:25:19** For the best part of a year

**00:25:22** And I actually used it for the first time a couple of days ago because I had to read through some legal documents and

**00:25:28** It's that's what this is perfect for it using the Apple pencil and making notes on a document

**00:25:32** It's great

**00:25:33** But other than that I've been using the smaller one at home and I've now been using it more because I've kind of like

**00:25:38** Repurposing it again

**00:25:39** Like now that I am pretty much set on the fact that I'm working on the Mac again

**00:25:44** That's just where I get my work done now

**00:25:46** Now I can start thinking about what the iPad again is for in my life

**00:25:50** it's interesting because it seems like we're on the eve of new iPads and

**00:25:54** It seems like the best technology could potentially be coming to the bigger one and I don't know how I feel about that

**00:25:59** Because I don't think I want the big one anymore

**00:26:01** Hmm

**00:26:02** I just want the little one and I would just say like, you know people will always ask this this I think that the smaller

**00:26:08** iPad Pro is the iPad Pro for like 90% of people. Oh, yeah, the big one is only if you are either a

**00:26:16** Deciding you want to do your work from an iPad or be if you're an artist

**00:26:20** I think they're really the only two reasons to get the big one other than that the 11 inches perfect

**00:26:25** So for me personally, I think that's probably where I'm gonna be now and so that means in current use

**00:26:32** It's just one iPad. It's my 11 inch iPad Pro and it's now the couch pad

**00:26:36** It's now the couch pad as you're talking

**00:26:37** I was just remembering Steve Jobs brought that couch on stage to demo the first iPad

**00:26:42** Like that's the the home of the iPad is the couch, you know, right right from from day one

**00:26:47** Yeah, I have my couch iPad and I love it

**00:26:51** It's great and I should have been using it a ton for you

**00:26:55** Recommended on our state of the apps episode you recommended reader as a your RSS reader

**00:27:00** and it got kind of stuck in my brain and I've been slowly trying to get back into the world of RSS and

**00:27:06** I've been really loving it and part of what's great about it is it's just perfect to kind of blast through the internet using

**00:27:14** That's like as the RSS reader on an iPad on the couch. It's just perfect great for reading

**00:27:20** I love it. I really love that feeling of oh, I'm at the end of the Internet

**00:27:25** I don't have to keep going in circles anymore

**00:27:28** I kind of I know that I've covered all of the places that I want to cover and nobody has posted anything new

**00:27:35** So fantastic. That's been one of the big uses of my couch iPad in the pandemic

**00:27:40** The big victim has been my research iPad which for me has been

**00:27:46** Basically untouched most of this time because like you have since I'm not going anywhere

**00:27:51** I might as well take advantage of the full desk setup that a Mac provides

**00:27:56** but also the research pad was

**00:28:00** Pretty much killed when I started playing around with obsidian

**00:28:04** Because like if I'm exploring a topic and I mean I'm reading a bunch of things around a topic

**00:28:09** I'm gonna constantly want to throw in little notes into my new note system and

**00:28:15** It's like well you totally have to have a Mac to do that. So the research pad just

**00:28:21** languished forever untouched

**00:28:24** but just as of I don't know like a week ago, maybe two weeks ago obsidian is

**00:28:31** Making their iPad version like I think they've really

**00:28:36** ramped up the order that they're intending to do these things because I suspect the number one piece of feedback they got from absolutely

**00:28:43** everyone was I love this but I wish it was on iOS and

**00:28:47** If you're part of the like VIP supporters

**00:28:50** You can get access to test flight and so I put it on my iPad and oh they have it like they actually have a better

**00:28:57** App now they have a beta for people to test it is very beta

**00:29:02** I installed it and synchronized my database and lost 50% of the data, but you know what's great

**00:29:09** This is oh my god

**00:29:11** No, no, but this but this is the whole this is the beauty like this is what I love about this system

**00:29:15** My whole database is just a bunch of dot MD files in folders and before I synced it

**00:29:21** I was like well, this feels like a dangerous operation. Let me just create an archive, you know zip it all together

**00:29:26** Like have a have a extra backup great. So it just delete them

**00:29:31** I think the problem was a bunch of stuff didn't sync over, you know, maybe it would have synced over eventually

**00:29:37** On the first run and I also as part of the beta testing process

**00:29:43** It clearly didn't like I use emojis in some of my file names so I can just visually distinguish some of the more important files

**00:29:50** Yeah, and it threw up an error like the emoji files don't exist sync completed

**00:29:57** No problem though thumbs up, you know, I was like, no it didn't

**00:30:01** But anyway, they've already released it a couple of versions and now it seems to be working totally fine

**00:30:05** And this is single-handedly revived the existence of the research pad in my life

**00:30:12** It makes sense playing around with it. Well because if the research iPad was great when you were doing your research

**00:30:19** There but then when one of the key research tools

**00:30:24** Became a application that had no iPad version

**00:30:28** Well, goodbye research iPad, right? Yeah

**00:30:31** Yeah, if you can't get to the data in the way that you want it

**00:30:34** Well, what are you gonna do? So I'm also surprised but now I also wouldn't be surprised

**00:30:38** It won the app is in a good state to see the research iPad come back with a plum

**00:30:43** Yeah, yeah, and again just like with reading with couchpad. It's just a nice, you know, it's it's a nice form factor for

**00:30:52** You know, I'm going through a bunch of stuff. I don't know exactly what I'm looking for

**00:30:55** I'm just making some notes like I really do

**00:30:57** I really do love the iPad for that and I love using it with the pencil and it's also really nice to

**00:31:04** I've always been a big fan of this have

**00:31:07** physically separate devices that you can set up to have limits on what they are used for like I

**00:31:14** have always loved that I think it's very conducive to working and

**00:31:18** so yes, I'm very happy to have that device come back more into my life because I've never

**00:31:26** I've never loved doing all the research stuff on the Mac

**00:31:30** It just it feels like there's there's too many different sorts of things that are occurring here and I want to be in a different like

**00:31:36** Mental space when I'm doing that sort of work, which is why it's great to be, you know sitting at a desk but

**00:31:42** Working on something like you're working on a piece of paper

**00:31:44** So if this question had been asked three weeks ago, I would say that I have one we just used for

**00:31:50** Internetting and reading but now I think I have two which is the casual couch pad and the serious work

**00:31:57** Research pad thanks to the obsidian beta for now, which is like for me

**00:32:02** I don't really feel like the what I'm doing now is my definitive always

**00:32:07** One of the reasons that I loved using the iPad for my work is I could just take it wherever I needed to be and I

**00:32:14** Travel a lot. Yeah iPad also really wins with mobility, which has not been an issue lately

**00:32:20** So I don't really know what the future is gonna be for me, but I've been enjoying using the Mac

**00:32:26** There's things that I love about the Mac the things that I don't love about the Mac

**00:32:29** but I do love that it's powerful and everything's right there and everything is available, but I

**00:32:35** Don't like the messiness of the Mac. I don't really like windowing, you know

**00:32:42** I can never get things I want and everything's overlapping and it looks terrible

**00:32:46** I'm like what I like about iOS is there's only so many ways that I can arrange things

**00:32:51** Yeah, but that's also the power of don't like any of the windows snapping tools like I don't like them on the Mac

**00:32:57** I don't know why I just don't like it

**00:32:59** Because they just feels alien to me, which is very strange

**00:33:03** Like even though I don't like windows overlapping when they don't overlap it doesn't like a Mac anymore

**00:33:07** And I don't know where I am. It's very strange

**00:33:10** The messiness of the Mac is also the power of the Mac and it is still the one thing that I wish they could get

**00:33:16** Like I still I always feel on my iPad that I want to be able to easily switch between

**00:33:21** Three things not just two things and it always kills me

**00:33:25** I'm like, oh god

**00:33:25** It's such a pain in the ass to get this other window up on the screen at the same time

**00:33:29** Yeah, it does feel to me like there is a medium between iPad OS and Mac OS

**00:33:34** For window arrangement and it's not what either one of them is doing something in the middle, but I just haven't found it yet

**00:33:41** Yeah, yeah, I'd love the iPad to move a little bit more in the Mac direction, but I'm also very aware that that is a

**00:33:50** supremely dangerous request that risks all of the things that make the iPad great

**00:33:55** We did have a bunch of questions about which notes app you're using now and clearly you've stuck with obsidian

**00:34:02** Yeah, yeah, I'm sticking with obsidian more. I use it more

**00:34:05** I like it, you know

**00:34:06** I've ended up now with hundreds and hundreds of notes in there, you know connected to each other in this

**00:34:11** Nice way that obsidian does still don't understand it

**00:34:14** You know, I was thinking about this a couple of days ago and I still don't I still don't understand how it works fully

**00:34:19** I don't know think think of it like freeform

**00:34:22** Journaling, you know, you there's not a set structure and that's part of what the advantage is, you know

**00:34:28** I know I very often come across lots of stuff that I just think

**00:34:32** this is a fun piece of information or this could make a good video at some point and

**00:34:39** It's nice to be able to throw it in obsidian in a way where there's a tiny bit of structure

**00:34:47** You know the things everything that goes in there now is connected to at least something else

**00:34:52** That's what I was gonna ask like this every note always have a connection to something else. Okay, I understand

**00:34:59** Yeah at this point. There's almost nothing that doesn't have a connection, you know when you start and there's fewer notes that's different again

**00:35:05** I think most people who use it dramatically

**00:35:08** Overrate the value of the connections and I think people like to show the pictures of the connections because they look pretty

**00:35:14** I don't really I don't think that that sort of stuff is directly useful

**00:35:18** but it is nice to in a note be able to just connect it to somewhere else so that in the future you can

**00:35:25** You know through serendipity happen to find like oh, right. I had something that was related to this

**00:35:31** So I guess the thing that obsidian does for me. That's perfect is

**00:35:36** It's not completely

**00:35:38** structureless like throwing something into

**00:35:41** the notes app where I would just have a ton of random things and

**00:35:46** it doesn't have the burden of

**00:35:49** Loading information into Ulysses where I'm going to be writing the actual scripts

**00:35:55** Because I want to keep Ulysses relatively clean and with the smallest number of active projects and it is possible

**00:36:01** So it just hits a nice middle ground where I don't feel like

**00:36:06** There has to be enough to be a sort of proto script or oh this one fact is too small to bother with

**00:36:12** It just it handles this in-between state of information really really well, and I think this is also the case where

**00:36:20** Being an electron app is the advantage that they could get it on the iPad real fast once they decided to actually do that

**00:36:27** It does feel a bit like a weird alien on the iPad like oh you don't belong here. It looks like a weird alien

**00:36:35** Everywhere like it doesn't look like any user interface. I have ever seen on any no. No, that's outrageous Mike

**00:36:41** No, I don't look like a weird alien on the Mac. It's a friendly

**00:36:45** Faceless rock from space to help you with all of your notes. I don't understand what your problem is

**00:36:50** I'm not saying it is bad you why what I'm saying is this it's the user interface is not for you

**00:36:55** It no it just doesn't look like anything else

**00:36:57** I've well you know what actually it looks closest to like the Adobe Pro apps

**00:37:01** I guess I can kind of see that I can kind of see that and so you know and one of the things about Adobe's apps

**00:37:06** Is they also don't look like they belong everywhere because they are designed to belong everywhere

**00:37:11** So they don't look like they belong anywhere. Yeah, yeah, that's totally fair, but

**00:37:15** Yeah, so to answer the other question about my notes. It's obsidian really really like it

**00:37:19** It's still hard to say what the actionable part of obsidian is but it's serving me very well

**00:37:25** And I'm still playing around with a lot and figuring it out

**00:37:27** And I'm very happy that it's on the iPad one day in the future when we record an episode in person again

**00:37:33** Mm-hmm. I really want you to just give me a very basic demo of how this thing looks and what I can't I can't get

**00:37:40** I can't give you I can't show you all my secrets. No. This is why I'm saying a basic demo

**00:37:44** I don't want to see everything but surely you can show me like a tree of some description, right? I

**00:37:50** Just feel like someone needs to explain this to me and every explanation I've come across

**00:37:55** Doesn't help me. Maybe it's just not for me. Maybe my brain just can't I can send you the picture

**00:38:01** No, the picture

**00:38:03** Everybody loves to see if their notes

**00:38:06** I can look at pictures on their website and I don't understand it

**00:38:11** Yeah, but you haven't seen it in the 80s neon theme right so

**00:38:20** Here we go, this is the this is the state of my knowledge

**00:38:25** Let me sell it to you over Skype. I

**00:38:28** Don't have I don't have my message on this computer because Mike this is the writing computer

**00:38:32** the only thing that is used for is writing and as a server and

**00:38:37** Podcasting and live streaming

**00:38:40** The only thing that's oh I also

**00:38:43** It's also my fastest computer

**00:38:45** So I use it to do all of the processing and all of the exporting of all of my videos as well

**00:38:50** So it does right just that's the right

**00:38:53** types of writing you know you write on it the the files right to the disc it's all just writing really yeah, oh my god

**00:39:00** I hate it

**00:39:06** Yeah, so those are all of my notes and how they're connected to each other

**00:39:09** And I don't understand what's complicated about this at all

**00:39:12** I like that there's a couple of just like singular dots on the outside. They are the lost notes

**00:39:16** Yes, those are the ones that aren't connected to anything

**00:39:18** So here's my question for you then so the notes that aren't connected to anything or the notes that are just connected to one other note

**00:39:24** How do you ever find them?

**00:39:27** Like how do you know they're there okay, let me pitch it to you this way

**00:39:33** Everyone likes to share this picture, but no one who's really getting anything done. I think is using this picture

**00:39:38** It's it's just fun to look at

**00:39:41** Obsidian is very much like how on your computer

**00:39:45** You can just use spotlight to try to find whatever it is you're looking for

**00:39:50** that's very much what the actual interface is and

**00:39:53** So say I come I'm reading and I come across an interesting piece of information about like the Royal Albert Hall

**00:40:01** in obsidian then I'll just just like spotlight they have a spotlight like interface that I can open up and start typing

**00:40:10** Well Albert Hall and if I have a note already with that name

**00:40:15** It'll just pull up and I can oh I can add this fun fact to the file that existed and if it doesn't I can just create

**00:40:20** The file instantly at that moment and add the fact

**00:40:23** Okay, that's how 99% of the time I'm

**00:40:28** Finding stuff is I'm not like looking around for it on this job mass

**00:40:32** I'm actually just using a spotlight type theory of a searching and if it exists then great if it doesn't

**00:40:38** Because I guess the thing that you have to rely on and I'm not saying this is a bad thing

**00:40:42** But the thing that you have to rely on is that you consistently create notes in a certain way, right?

**00:40:48** Yeah, you you have to name things what they are. Yeah, I was the way I would say it

**00:40:55** This is why you know, I don't know what other people are specifically using it for but for me when I'm trying to

**00:41:04** You know in some ways my job is to try to

**00:41:08** collect all of the things that I find are interesting about the world and

**00:41:13** That's what I'm building up here is like a personal database of everything that I've ever come across

**00:41:19** That I find interesting enough to make a note of that I might think is useful in the future

**00:41:25** but once you've created that Royal Albert Hall note if

**00:41:28** You had then and find out something else about the Royal Albert Hall

**00:41:31** Will you add it to the existing note that already exists or do you create another new note? Yeah

**00:41:36** Yeah, I would add it to the existing okay notes

**00:41:38** Yeah

**00:41:38** Cuz this was one of the things that confused me last time that that's this is now helped because my understanding was just like every

**00:41:44** Piece of text you ever write gets its own note

**00:41:46** Like that was what I took away from that discussion and that didn't make any sense to me

**00:41:50** Separated sentence. Yeah, they're not they're not so I couldn't get my head around it's like this is madness

**00:41:56** But now okay, so what I'm kind of seeing is it's not too dissimilar

**00:42:01** I guess from the way that I would make a note

**00:42:04** But I think I would have a lot still a lot less singular notes, but you know

**00:42:08** yeah, and and the way that the

**00:42:11** The link stuff is useful is that there are situations when you're working on something else

**00:42:18** You can kind of see if you've connected to this thing from

**00:42:23** Somewhere else in the database like it'll draw that to your attention, you know

**00:42:27** Oh, you know you're working on this video which you know is related to this thing in London and

**00:42:34** In the Royal Albert Hall note you made a connection to this other thing here

**00:42:39** And so it's just like reminding you that these two ideas are related or you know

**00:42:42** This this might be a nice time to make an off-handed reference to this other fact that's connected

**00:42:47** Does this happen automatically?

**00:42:49** So say you were writing a note about some street in London and then you just wrote the words Royal Albert Hall in there

**00:42:55** Does obsidian automatically link or alert you? Yeah, so even if I don't

**00:43:02** Manually link those two together

**00:43:04** Later on if I'm working on the Royal Albert Hall note, I can see that in other places

**00:43:09** I've mentioned this and it's like, okay, there are connections here

**00:43:12** That's one of the things that's nice about the software is trying to draw your attention to the connections even if you haven't always

**00:43:21** Explicitly in the way the program wants you to made a connection between two

**00:43:27** No, things could get out of hand though, right? Like if you had a note called

**00:43:30** The would it link to every other time the word that has been used in obsidian that would be stupid. No, no

**00:43:37** No, I know it's super I'm making a stupid example, but I'm just trying to understand it

**00:43:40** But would it do that do the backlinks for that? I don't think it would work that way. Okay

**00:43:46** The okay, you have 50 notes that start with the word the so it's only checking for if a note starts with the phrase

**00:43:55** That's the ones that it's just pulling up because those are the most likely ones. Okay, so I've just okay, so the

**00:44:02** shift to create

**00:44:04** Yes, so okay. So I have what they call unlinked mentions. Yep. There are in my database

**00:44:13** 12,155 unlinked mentions of the word the in the database and so then what do you do to link those placed on but like

**00:44:21** Do you have to do something or do you create a link from those?

**00:44:28** So the other thing I like about this is that it's basically marked down with one additional feature

**00:44:33** Which is if you put two square brackets around a word that creates a link that is you explicitly saying I want to

**00:44:40** Link to the note that has this is the title

**00:44:44** So now if you put two square brackets around the word the there will be 12,000 linked mentions

**00:44:50** No, no

**00:44:51** I would have to go to another note where the word the exists and put square brackets around that word the and

**00:44:58** Then only that instance will be linked to my note, which is called the so the links are very deliberate

**00:45:06** They don't happen automatically right you have to say I want to link this thing

**00:45:11** Yeah, the app still does create a dotted line link to everything

**00:45:17** But you then have to go in and be like yeah, I want these to be

**00:45:21** Hierarchically linked together. Yeah, the application itself will highlight to you

**00:45:26** Like if you've missed something like for example if you go to the Royal Albert Hall one if you've missed one

**00:45:30** You now could link that together if you wanted to the app is smart enough to tell you that

**00:45:34** Yes

**00:45:35** There is a place where you can go where the app will suggest if it thinks there's something that isn't connected that you might want to

**00:45:42** That's what it will do. This is making a lot more sense to me now

**00:45:44** Okay, are we finally beginning to get there a little bit?

**00:45:48** Okay, more I learn about it the more I realize I do not have a use for this but that and that's totally fine

**00:45:53** I just wish really struggling to understand what it did

**00:45:56** But I'm feeling like I'm getting it a bit more now and honestly the example of that did help me because okay

**00:46:03** That was what I wanted to check

**00:46:05** It's like that the application is cross referencing every single note with every single note because I think that's what you

**00:46:11** In my mind that's what you would want it to do because you're relying on this system to pick up pieces of information

**00:46:17** You've otherwise dropped. Yeah, and that has totally happened to me a few times. The database has gotten bigger where I've realized

**00:46:24** Oh, I phrase something in a slightly different way

**00:46:26** And I have two things that can be merged or I didn't realize that I've already written something about this

**00:46:31** But that feels like the superpower for someone like you and this this is why I really like it

**00:46:36** Yeah

**00:46:36** If you've been going on a train here and a train over there and then at some point they intersect

**00:46:42** I mean we're off to the races right like now you've stumbled across something which could be super interesting in a way that you wouldn't

**00:46:49** Initially think about so like yeah as a person who is like collecting pieces of information

**00:46:55** Eventually you get enough of them to link together. You've got a cool story to tell yeah

**00:46:59** That's the idea of it like even if it wasn't serendipitously

**00:47:03** Connecting things in this way. It would still be useful just as a database, but I view that as a like

**00:47:09** The more that goes in here

**00:47:10** There's a higher chance of this lottery ticket paying off someday with a interesting connection that I didn't think

**00:47:16** But it's still valuable to use even without that and also just for me

**00:47:20** the other thing I like to be able to do is

**00:47:23** Connect the related videos to each other

**00:47:25** So as any intense viewer of the channel know I love making little connections between videos

**00:47:30** And this this is one way where when I'm thinking about stuff

**00:47:33** It's helpful to me to be able to mark explicit connections like oh this video is related to that video at this point

**00:47:42** It's not really actionable, but I do find it helpful in some way just just to be constantly

**00:47:47** Contextualizing how all of the videos are related to each other. That was helpful. Okay, great

**00:49:55** Oh, thanks to fit bod for their support of this show and relay FM

**00:50:00** Jordy asks I'm wondering why you're so secretive about the exact number of theme system journals that you order or sell each time

**00:50:07** You've mentioned a number in the past and I appreciate that but now it's cloaked in mystery again

**00:50:12** What is cloaked in mystery? Why is that my that's right?

**00:50:15** Honestly the phrase cloaked in mystery makes me want to keep it a secret more

**00:50:21** So this is interesting how many journals are under this cloak

**00:50:24** No idea could be one could be a million depends how big the cloak is depends on how big the cloak is

**00:50:29** This is this is a good question because like thinking back across it when I saw this question

**00:50:33** I was like oh yeah

**00:50:34** This is weird because there have been times where we've been very explicit about the number and times where we haven't I'll be honest

**00:50:40** There is no real rhyme or reason why yeah, yeah

**00:50:43** I didn't want to talk about how many we ordered the first time the very very first time which was 200

**00:50:50** Because if we didn't sell out I didn't want to look like an idiot right it would just be embarrassing

**00:50:56** Then there was a little bit of that for the second time where I think we ordered like

**00:51:01** 2000 of them or something and it was still that was still a hangover there and then the first time we ever shared the numbers

**00:51:06** We made a bet on it was when we ordered three thousand which was that's right. That's right

**00:51:11** So that was the point when we actually shared a concrete number

**00:51:14** So it's it's always been a bit up or down and I've never really felt one way or another about it

**00:51:19** So like I'm happy to share some numbers like now

**00:51:23** So should we talk about how many we sold a version two?

**00:51:26** Yeah, so version two is what we've sold this year. So all of these sales have been basically this year

**00:51:32** I guess starting in late November so version two we've now sold as of recording now

**00:51:38** 7300 journals

**00:51:39** That's a version two which is now eclipsed version one

**00:51:43** So we sold more version two journals in the last three months

**00:51:48** Then we sold of all of the version one journals

**00:51:51** Which was 18 months right and that was just under seven thousand was how many we sold at the first one

**00:51:58** It was like 6900 and something. So those are the numbers

**00:52:01** people really like the second version

**00:52:04** As they should it's fantastic. Yeah, no, it's it's going really well and

**00:52:10** yeah, I think this is one of these things that we just sort of like slipped into not talking about the numbers and

**00:52:16** the question is a good time to

**00:52:19** decloak the mystery of how many there actually are and

**00:52:23** they're just

**00:52:25** big numbers that are also a little intimidating when placing orders and

**00:52:31** Hoping to God, they're not getting wet on a dock somewhere as they're delayed in customs or whatever and you try to visualize like

**00:52:38** How big is a box of?

**00:52:40** Several thousand journals. It's probably pretty big and we've ordered 10,000 right?

**00:52:46** That's that's also the terrifying part. There's there's 10,000 on the way

**00:52:53** Which we're hoping will basically last us the year. That's roughly what we're thinking

**00:53:00** Will be the case. Yeah. Well, you know, we'll have to see exactly how that goes

**00:53:03** But that's the next big order that's coming in to try to have it so that people can always

**00:53:09** Buy a journal and have it shipped to them just like the way inventory management is supposed to work

**00:53:14** I think we've solved it. I think we solved the stock problem now. You're confident in that. Yeah, okay

**00:53:19** I believe in you Mike. I am genuinely cuz now like I know how long it takes to make more

**00:53:25** Mm-hmm and

**00:53:26** For me, I think the only time that we're ever gonna be a risky point again will be December January

**00:53:33** Yes, right because that's gonna be the the onboarding point for more people

**00:53:39** and

**00:53:40** So, you know like I'm gonna spend a lot of time now over the next nine months trying to forecast how on how many shall I actually?

**00:53:49** order at that point I

**00:53:51** Have no idea right now

**00:53:52** But it will be a lot because again like we are now in a point where we can make these bigger bets

**00:53:59** Because the product is fixed. Mm-hmm, or it wasn't before so one of the reasons that we had a lot of struggle with version one and

**00:54:07** Couldn't make an order of the sizes that we've been making is because

**00:54:12** We didn't want to keep stock for a long time because we wanted to change it

**00:54:17** Mm-hmm, so we didn't want to have so much stock that it would take us two years to sell it

**00:54:21** When in six months time we wanted a new version, you know

**00:54:25** So now that we don't have that like it doesn't matter. Yeah, if we still have

**00:54:31** 6,000 of these in January of next year, it doesn't matter because right they'll just get sold then too, you know, right

**00:54:38** Yeah, we're not competing with the new versions of our own thing anymore, which does dramatically simplify the problem

**00:54:44** So that's been a big help and now I don't feel the threat of embarrassment anymore

**00:54:50** All right, because I feel pretty confident in what we've got. So those are the numbers that we have

**00:54:55** Oh, actually a bit of follow-up and we was talking about the UK that stuff. Oh, right

**00:55:02** Yeah, well, we still don't have a vet number. That's not the follow-up. Oh, okay, but I ordered a journal when it arrived

**00:55:07** No problem. Oh great. Fantastic. I can't say that that's gonna happen to you if you order one

**00:55:13** It did arrive so great

**00:55:15** So yours wasn't stuck on that ship and the Suez Canal it made it through just fine

**00:55:20** Oh that I had some people reach out to me to ask if we would be affected

**00:55:25** And as far as I'm aware, no, I mean obviously the Jones are made in Europe now and the paper comes from Europe

**00:55:30** But gosh knows right they might be like

**00:55:36** But as far as I'm aware we are unaffected by the Suez Canal

**00:55:39** Yeah, the company needed one new debossing stamp and it was it was in the Suez Canal

**00:55:45** I will tell you I I

**00:55:47** Really felt it when I saw that because like I now know

**00:55:51** What that feels like?

**00:55:53** And I actually have a friend who has products on that boat

**00:56:02** On that exact ship the evergreen that's awful and know someone who has container ships of products on that

**00:56:08** I mean if you see a picture of it, it's enormous. I mean, it's the size of a city

**00:56:13** Yeah, those those those container ships the size of them

**00:56:17** It just blows your mind

**00:56:20** Even in just a photograph and you start you start looking at like, okay

**00:56:23** How many how many containers can I count on the deck of that ship and then you remember?

**00:56:28** Oh, right. There's entire companies that convert those containers into micro apartments for people like they're very big

**00:56:35** I am hoping that it gets resolved soon before we have to ship anything by air again

**00:56:40** Oh because I guarantee you that all shipping rates are up for everything. Yes

**00:56:45** I was like why but Mike if we're using airplanes the airplanes don't get stuck in the Suez Canal. Well, they might I don't know

**00:56:51** what's on the boats but

**00:56:53** But now all shipping all freight shipping is gonna be more expensive

**00:56:57** I don't know that that ship stuck in the Suez Canal

**00:57:00** I haven't been able like I've been dying to really dig into all of the details of it since I was only just able to

**00:57:06** See the headlines and I was in my real crunch gotta finish a video period

**00:57:09** But it's just I don't know. There's there's something like

**00:57:13** delightfully chaotic about the whole

**00:57:15** Situation like it's it's bad that a ship is stuck in the Suez Canal

**00:57:19** But it's also kind of funny because it looks ridiculous

**00:57:22** Oh, yeah, I mean you've seen the memes with like the one little digger trying to get the

**00:57:26** I

**00:57:29** Little digger trying to get the like trying to wear away some of the site like the wall like the bank

**00:57:35** digger in this

**00:57:37** Astronomically large container ship because if it's somehow gonna help I've got I've got a lot of fun internet catching up to do

**00:57:45** This has been one of those rare things which is unites people into making fun or something

**00:57:50** It's just so incomprehensible. No, I disagree. It's the exact opposite

**00:57:55** It's it's funny because it's really understandable. The problem is very basic coming at us from different places

**00:58:01** I agree what you're saying. You know what the problem is that there's a ship. It's too big

**00:58:06** It's stuck right like am I just a weirdo here? There's something kind of delightful about it. It's like oh

**00:58:12** No, it's very relatable. Somebody just made a little screw-up

**00:58:15** But what I mean is like the sizes and scale of things are just oh yeah

**00:58:19** for us to comprehend but the idea that somebody may like just

**00:58:23** Did a whoopsie and now

**00:58:26** Like the entire globe's shipping again other reason it's relatable is oh great

**00:58:32** We're stuck in line behind the person at the grocery store who you know wants to take a long time or is trouble for some reason

**00:58:39** Right. It's like it's the ship version of that like oh great

**00:58:43** Except the problem is the entire world supply chain is trying to pass through this one narrow canal. I

**00:58:50** Don't want to place a bet on how long it's gonna take to get that ship fixed

**00:58:53** I feel like I have I have no ability to bet is it before the podcast goes out or is it a month from now?

**00:58:59** I mean I saw something that suggested they were gonna have it out this weekend

**00:59:03** But I don't believe it for a second you don't believe it for a second no

**00:59:07** I just feel like this is not something anybody can estimate. It will happen when it happens

**00:59:14** It's like this will just happen when it happens and that's that right enjoy going around the Cape of Good Hope everyone

**00:59:22** You know have fun with that

**00:59:24** Alex says what is something you wished you would have known earlier when designing your work, so I feel like this is this is a you

**00:59:31** Question, but I have I have one little one my little one is you need a

**00:59:36** charging station

**00:59:38** So even if you don't think you have a lot of things that need charging you have

**00:59:43** More than you think you do and it's a real pain in the butt to just try to have some random wires in random

**00:59:50** locations to charge your things

**00:59:52** So it took a while, but I think halfway through this whole situation at some point

**00:59:57** I have a little it's just right behind me, but I have a little like multi-level open tiny storage space thing that I got a

**01:00:05** 10 USB hub for and just like bought a bunch of wires and went around my office and thought what's everything that needs charging

**01:00:13** Great you're all gonna live on one of the shelves of this thing and you're gonna be plugged in all the time and

**01:00:19** this is where all of the things charge and I'm

**01:00:22** made a

**01:00:24** ridiculously big improvement to the the tidiness and the readiness of my whole office and

**01:00:30** I just kept thinking I don't need a charging station, but I really did and I think everyone should just pick a shelf

**01:00:37** Put a bunch of USB cables on that shelf and that's where all the things charge. What about you?

**01:00:43** I wished I would have known and there would be a global pandemic for to shut my studio down for six months

**01:00:49** Okay, next question

**01:00:52** I don't think that's the spirit of the question. It's also not very relatable. No because I mean, let's hope

**01:00:58** This isn't something you need to think about my office people got in touch again, by the way

**01:01:03** That was funny. Yeah, I got I got another email

**01:01:07** Like you you got in touch with us looking for some office space. We're ready to accept customers

**01:01:13** Let us know what you need and then just

**01:01:17** Dragged it into the trash and didn't reply. I'm into year two of my lease now Wow

**01:01:22** That's much longer than I would have guessed

**01:01:26** What percentage of that time have you actually been able to be in the office less than half less than half?

**01:01:32** The real advice that I'll give and this is good for any environment is know that in six months

**01:01:37** You will want to redo it

**01:01:38** So yes start paying attention

**01:01:41** Immediately from when you're working of the things that you would wish would be better and just keep a note of them all so then

**01:01:46** When you get to the point after six months where you hate your office, you already have a list of things to improve it

**01:01:51** Yeah, that's totally perfect. And I think that that's bang on for me. I think whatever was seven months maybe eight months into this

**01:01:58** I've rearranged the desks and and also changed all of the storage. You're totally right Mike. That's a great one when you think you're done

**01:02:05** Start making notes on all of the things that annoy you and in six months change it, you know, I barely started

**01:02:11** I've genuinely barely started to get this studio to a point where I'm happy with I could never actually got to do it

**01:02:18** Well, I hope you're taking notes. I will be when I begin

**01:02:21** I'm so sorry Mike. It's just you know

**01:02:27** We're gonna look it's brighter days coming up coming up fast. So you're gonna get all the mega office you want

**01:03:05** What I love about it is I can go in really easily search for that domain

**01:03:10** And then when I find the one that's I want I find the one that's available

**01:03:13** I register it in just a few seconds and then I can just set up a forward

**01:04:23** Theodore asks great name Theodore actually. Yeah, you like Theodore. Yeah, Theodore is a good name

**01:04:29** Anyway, Theodore asks, how would you describe yourselves when you were in school?

**01:04:33** How did you manage your tasks then and how do your systems today?

**01:04:37** Differ from the ones that you had at the time. What was school-age Mike like?

**01:04:42** I feel like I don't have any idea what you were what you were like as a

**01:04:45** young lad

**01:04:47** working your way through your

**01:04:49** GCSEs I

**01:04:51** Wonder if it would be surprising actually if I describe I kind of had a couple of different stages of

**01:04:58** school Mike

**01:05:00** I guess the first stage was kind of just like

**01:05:05** Really followed all the rules and tried to get all my work done to the best of my ability. Mm-hmm

**01:05:10** Then I did the exact opposite

**01:05:13** The stage one is foreshadowing what stage two must be. Yeah, like stage one version of me was just like

**01:05:21** teachers pet

**01:05:22** Kind of and then stage two was just acting out. Mm-hmm

**01:05:28** like I

**01:05:29** Like I look back on myself then and I'm just like why were you the way that you were?

**01:05:34** Like one of my things was like I wrote all of my English coursework in a pen that had purple ink

**01:05:42** Just to be annoying just to be not which is unacceptable

**01:05:44** So when my work was done, I had to photocopy it or to hand it in

**01:05:49** So it would be in black and I knew that I was gonna have to do this

**01:05:53** But just like kept doing it. I just kept turning the work in it wasn't me. It was photocopying it my teacher would photocopy it

**01:06:00** you know and this is like when I would be

**01:06:03** Put into a situation where I was having to stay after school to do my English coursework because I just wouldn't do it

**01:06:09** Without being put in a room to do it

**01:06:12** Right and it was one of those situations where I was probably I knew this like I know looking back

**01:06:18** I understand it

**01:06:19** I probably knew it at the time where I was good at school, right?

**01:06:22** Like I was smart and I had good grades

**01:06:25** They could have been better if I would have actually applied myself properly

**01:06:29** But I went to a school that kind of needed

**01:06:33** Good grades. So the teachers would have to put up with my shit, right? Okay

**01:06:39** I see I see which like when I look back on it now and like it annoys me that I was that way

**01:06:45** But it's just how I was right? So like it was like, oh you're gonna be in coursework class

**01:06:51** No, you put me into tension

**01:06:53** But we're not gonna call it that coursework class Mike

**01:06:56** It's not detention and you're gonna take the work that I put in pink ink

**01:07:02** Because you need that and you're just gonna photocopy it. So that was up until the ages of like 16

**01:07:09** 16 to 18 when I was in a levels

**01:07:11** I just changed again and just really wanted to do the best I could do

**01:07:15** Mm-hmm. So like it really my problem was in the ages of 15 to 16

**01:07:20** I made a lot of friends quickly because like the way that I don't really know how this sort of stuff works in America

**01:07:26** But when you go into GCSEs you choose your subjects and so the classes get mixed up

**01:07:32** And so I was exposed to a lot of people and then started to make more friends and then the making of more friends

**01:07:39** Kind of made me start to act out a bit. Oh, okay. Your friends were a bad influence on you. That's what you're saying

**01:07:44** Yeah, okay, but like what is that? Like is there what is GCSE? How would Americans understand what GCSE?

**01:07:50** Yeah, don't don't try it

**01:07:51** It doesn't matter look a bit like Mike Mike was able to do

**01:07:54** Something a little bit more intense than electives where he was able to have control over his schedule

**01:07:59** For what classes he was taking and he you've just did it

**01:08:02** He took classes that ended up with him with a bunch of troublemakers who also picked those electives. Correct. Because humans dramatically

**01:08:10** underestimate how powerful selection effects are and this is one of those cases which kids pick what classes it's not a random selection

**01:08:18** It tells you something about the kids

**01:08:21** That's what that is. But then when I did my A levels, which is 16 to 18

**01:08:26** Mm-hmm. I was much more well, I think part of the reason for me then was I actually got to choose the things I wanted to do

**01:08:33** So I was just more engaged because I got to choose the subjects

**01:08:36** I cared about the most because the places where I tended to act out the most was the stuff that I didn't care about

**01:08:41** Yeah, I've always thought the whole a-level system is the best part of the UK educational system that it that it's 16 you get to both

**01:08:49** Choose and have complete control over the schedule and also

**01:08:54** Dramatically reduce the number of classes that are being taken like I think those two are great

**01:08:59** Combination and then another normal thing people to do is the second year to change it again

**01:09:03** You like drop one. Mm-hmm

**01:09:05** like I did four and then dropped one for my second year that reduces a lot of

**01:09:10** student unhappiness like you can pick the things that you like and you can also drop all of the annoying

**01:09:17** Surrounding parts that you know are what make it feel like you're going to school and and instead you get to experience a kind of

**01:09:23** Mini college like I think that the a-level system has a lot to recommend it, you know broadly speaking in the way that it works

**01:09:29** I did make one fatal flaw of my a-level. So yeah, they tricked me, right? Oh, yeah

**01:09:33** They like how they trick you you should do politics. There's no coursework. It's just exams

**01:09:38** Oh, that sound that sounds great, right and there's like, oh wait so much worse

**01:09:43** There was so many exams for politics that you basically just ended up doing the coursework in a timed environment

**01:09:51** It was terrible

**01:09:52** Plus I didn't really enjoy politics that much did get a couple of cool school trips though

**01:09:57** Mm-hmm, so wasn't all bad right so no coursework ten times as many tests, but they just didn't mention that second part

**01:10:06** It's only exams but not that like three times more exams than any other course that you do

**01:10:12** The exams are just essays so

**01:10:17** I'm now writing my course I can't do a timed environment, but maybe I'd actually prepared for that in GCSE

**01:10:23** By not actually spending the time to do the coursework and doing it all against the timer anyway

**01:10:28** Because I was gonna run out of time before I had needed I had it in so anyway

**01:10:33** So I had some some trouble years, but overall I did try to do my best. Hmm

**01:10:38** That's very noble of you attempting to do your best

**01:10:42** Unfortunately was a terrible slacker who never attempted to do it

**01:10:47** Oh, I was still slacking I only do my best up to the level at which I was willing to commit but within those

**01:10:55** Right, yeah, I was I

**01:10:58** Was shall we say not strongly motivated just to do anything in school and and yeah, it was as a

**01:11:07** Extremely strategic slacker and it's one of those things in life where it just

**01:11:12** It feels like everything comes around it all comes full circle

**01:11:16** And it's why when I was a teacher as ten times worse of a strategic

**01:11:20** Slacker than I ever was when I was a student, but it's like oh, right

**01:11:24** But yeah the kid who slacked off as a student is also a slacker teacher

**01:11:28** Like what a shocking surprise like he's on only ones to know exactly what really matters, you know

**01:11:34** And I was like in high school. I was always this pain-in-the-ass kid doing these

**01:11:38** calculations for exactly how much is this assignment worth and

**01:11:43** Try to constantly predict out what my grade could be like, you know

**01:11:49** B B is an excellent target to aim for and it's like higher than a B is more work than it's worth

**01:11:56** lower than a B is no good so like

**01:12:00** Don't don't spend one iota more energy than you absolutely need to get that B

**01:12:06** Like B plus is great

**01:12:08** But it's a you know

**01:12:09** It's a sign that you may be pushing too hard and so like that was that was very much

**01:12:14** My take on it in school and I feel lucky that it didn't bite me in the ass in some ways

**01:12:20** like, you know being a strategic slacker is

**01:12:24** It's a risky move like, you know, you better not get anything wrong because if you do

**01:12:31** problems can compound really quickly and I just sort of I

**01:12:36** Lucked out with that stuff, but I did not enjoy being a student at all

**01:12:40** I thought basically everything that the teachers were asking me to do was pointless busy work and

**01:12:47** adult me felt vindicated that child me was correct in this matter that like yes

**01:12:53** 90% of it was total pointless busy work. All of this is to say it is not surprising that I had

**01:13:00** Absolutely terrible work habits when I left the education system and you know

**01:13:07** Stumbled around as a young adult for a while trying to figure out. Oh

**01:13:12** How do I actually get things done that I care about when there isn't like this whole thing?

**01:13:17** It's like this whole system and structure around me. So that's what I was like

**01:13:20** I think it's fair to say if you were listening to this show and you're in school

**01:13:26** You were doing a better job than both of us were

**01:13:30** Because you are the type of person that cares about having your life in some kind of order

**01:13:36** Right. I mean, I mean yes, but I also know that younger me would listen to this podcast

**01:13:43** Because he would know that the older me

**01:13:47** Was the way that he is like I remember being a kid and like, you know because back then there were no podcasts

**01:13:55** but you know, you just hear people talking, you know, there's interview shows or whatever and I just remember like

**01:14:01** always feeling like I was listening really hard for

**01:14:05** Yeah, but how it how is this successful adult really and I always felt like my ears perked up a lot

**01:14:12** When I heard people say like just casual remarks about being a slacker in certain situations

**01:14:18** So I don't recommend this as a general path

**01:14:22** But you know, you can't change the nature of the way that you are to some extent

**01:14:27** You just got to like you got to work with what you've got and it's also again why like I said, I like the a-level system

**01:14:35** because it sooner gives students more control so that they can select things that they're

**01:14:41** Actually interested in and then be like, oh

**01:14:44** now I have a reason to

**01:14:47** Try to be effective in what it is that I'm doing as opposed to feeling like I'm in a prison system

**01:14:53** And I'm just trying to shirk the pointless work that they're foisting upon me

**01:14:58** Devon asks, how do you guys get back on track when your day's plans go horribly wrong? I

**01:15:06** Like this horribly wrong. I like the assumption that if something goes horribly wrong

**01:15:12** I have the ability to get my day back

**01:15:14** That's why most here is that there is the assumption that that is what happens to me

**01:15:23** So what you're saying is when the day's gone horribly wrong the answer is just bail just bail on the day

**01:15:29** Well, if my day goes horribly wrong

**01:15:31** The first thing that I will do in the attempt of trying to bring any order in it is taking a real serious look at

**01:15:37** My to-do list and realizing how much of it can be delegated to like can be moved to different days

**01:15:42** Mm-hmm. Like that is the first thing that I would do is like taking a very real look at it and being like no

**01:15:47** No, not what would you prefer was done today? Like what can you actually?

**01:15:53** Realistically do today everything else is moving

**01:15:56** Right, right not your fantasy day like let's get let's get real about what could happen in the remaining three hours of

**01:16:05** Productivity that you have left or whatever. Yeah, I think I think that that's a good idea. I mean obviously

**01:16:10** Horribly wrong is a lot of things, you know, I do think

**01:16:15** It is a real skill to be able to know when a day is lost and just accept that

**01:16:22** If that is better than feeling bad for the rest of the day, but it can it can be hard

**01:16:29** To know when to make that judgment call

**01:16:31** I think that I've done over the past few months which has been very helpful is

**01:16:35** You know, my problem is always getting started in the morning

**01:16:39** So, you know while I am very protective of my mornings if a day goes wrong

**01:16:44** it's because I'm having a hard time like

**01:16:48** just getting going with what needs to be done and I have

**01:16:53** calendared out what my

**01:16:56** theoretical

**01:16:57** morning should be and you can very easily get into the situation of like, oh I've dilly-dallyed for an hour and now I've already like

**01:17:06** Pushed all of these things back and you just like get this cascade problem. So I actually have a little thing in OmniFocus

**01:17:14** Which is the dumbest thing but it's the first item that pops up after I've brushed my teeth and done all the normal boot-up stuff is

**01:17:22** Says like if it's a late start start at the beginning

**01:17:27** And go until exercise

**01:17:30** So I have a kind of blocked off

**01:17:33** What should be the beginning of the morning?

**01:17:35** Which is like two work sessions and an exercise session and that's you know

**01:17:40** Maybe a third of what the theoretical morning should be but I've actually genuinely found this dumb reminder to myself that

**01:17:48** Hey, man. Yeah, you've got a late start today, you know, you slept in or you just couldn't get going or whatever

**01:17:55** cool, but right now you can just start at the beginning and

**01:18:01** go for like three of these double units and

**01:18:05** still have a

**01:18:07** Victorious day even if this is all that you accomplish and as is often the case when you set a kind of lower bar for yourself

**01:18:14** It can be one easier to start and you can end up doing much more than you originally planned to anyway

**01:18:20** So it is the dumbest

**01:18:23** Psychological trick but it's basically this way of telling myself

**01:18:27** You can start at the beginning any time

**01:18:30** You're not actually late for this imaginary writing appointment that you've put on the calendar

**01:18:35** You can just start right now. So that's one of the things that I do. What's a double unit you said double unit

**01:18:42** Oh, sorry all of my time is broken down into units, which are 40 minutes

**01:18:46** That's like the writing blocks is how I think of that is like, okay two double units of

**01:18:52** writing in the morning is like a session of 120 minutes a quick break and then another session of 120 minutes and then

**01:18:59** Exercise like that would be the ideal start to a morning this idea of blocking out your ideal day kind of it

**01:19:05** This feels like there's some parallels to me and my morning alarms

**01:19:09** I'm never actually gonna wake up at 8. Sorry, but I'd like to believe I will

**01:19:14** I'll disagree because I do hit the mornings more often than not and it sounds like I always wake up planning to

**01:19:21** Fail with the first alarm

**01:19:25** To be fair I've talked about this before like planning out a theoretically perfect two weeks again, it's not like I'm

**01:19:32** Creating a schedule that I'm really holding myself to I always think this is much more useful as a limiting exercise

**01:19:39** In terms of thinking even if you had the perfect two weeks

**01:19:44** How much can you really get done if you actually put it all on the calendar?

**01:19:49** And I think that helps constrain being

**01:19:53** over ambitious in

**01:19:55** Goals and trying to be much more realistic and imagine it helps you be realistic about anything

**01:20:02** Additional you could put into a week too, right? Like if someone wants to have a meeting with you

**01:20:06** Yes, you're like well

**01:20:08** I know I can't do it on these two days because even if I was just doing the bare minimum of these two days

**01:20:15** I wouldn't have the time for it. Yeah. Yeah, it's less about interruptions

**01:20:18** I mean especially in the past year because I haven't haven't had any which is delightful for the most part and it is more just about

**01:20:24** knowing like oh I only have so many hours of writing in a day and only so many hours of writing in a week and

**01:20:32** by

**01:20:33** Putting that down on the calendar. It can help constrain

**01:20:37** Yeah, yeah, there's many interesting projects you would like to work on

**01:20:40** But you can't spread these hours over too many things or you can't always chase down the most exciting thing at this particular moment

**01:20:48** Otherwise, you'll never get finished

**01:20:50** Again, like that is always something that I am struggling against

**01:20:53** But this is one of the tools that is helpful, you know, like I have it in fantastic. I'll open a lot is the

**01:21:00** theoretically perfect schedule

**01:21:03** but I'm not

**01:21:05** Really trying to match that down to the minute. It's it's again just more of like a guidance is it a separate calendar?

**01:21:12** Yeah, it's it's the way in fantastic how you can bring up those calendar sets, which is one of the reasons why I love it

**01:21:17** That's cool. So you could turn it off if you're like, I need to be realistic about why I'm actually supposed to be doing today

**01:21:22** Yes

**01:21:22** Yeah

**01:21:23** I have it open to just sort of look at sometimes and to think about you know, what's going to happen this week

**01:21:29** But yeah, it's not an actionable calendar

**01:21:31** You know like when we're planning when the next cortex recording is going to be or if I have to set up a meeting or whatever

**01:21:36** Like that calendar goes right away. It's like goodbye and then I have a separate actionable calendar

**01:21:42** No, I'm sorry. We can't record this week. I have seven theoretical writing blocks

**01:21:48** Yeah, exactly I think that I do have some element at this type of thing when it comes to my task list

**01:21:56** Where like I have things in my task list where it's like in an ideal world

**01:22:01** They would be done today, but they don't have to be so this is not exactly the same

**01:22:06** But there is this element of like I kind of know when looking at my list

**01:22:10** Like what are the things that actually need to be done today and one of the things that I could

**01:22:15** move if I needed to

**01:22:18** Mm-hmm. I couldn't really work of calendars that way like for me

**01:22:21** Calendar is a very much a source of truth

**01:22:24** Yes, a lot of my work really is based on time

**01:22:30** Right because I'm collaborating with people in real time

**01:22:33** Which means we both have to be where we're supposed to be at the time. We said we're going to be there. So

**01:22:39** I can't really have this like

**01:22:42** Maybe I'll show up

**01:22:45** Maybe I won't right? Okay. My life doesn't really work that way

**01:22:48** Um, we've really it's kind of funny because now this question has gone horribly wrong because we're not actually talking about the question

**01:22:54** Anymore, so how do you get your day back on track when it goes horribly wrong?

**01:22:59** I really think that one of these things is you just gotta you gotta forgive yourself

**01:23:03** Mm-hmm. All right, like I had one of these days

**01:23:06** Recently when I lost an entire day trying to get our notebooks from customs

**01:23:10** I just lost the entire day because I was asked to produce paperwork that I couldn't even conceive of and so

**01:23:17** We had to spend the entire day

**01:23:20** researching what on earth I was being asked to produce

**01:23:24** and

**01:23:25** The real great thing that can happen on a day like this is that you fix the problem, right?

**01:23:30** Because if you fix the thing that was major day go horribly wrong

**01:23:34** Then you can give yourself a pat on the back and you don't worry about all the things you didn't do

**01:23:38** Because it's like man, I got through that one, but this isn't always the case and sometimes things can go on for longer

**01:23:45** Sometimes you just have to be like well, there was nothing I could have done about this

**01:23:49** Mm-hmm

**01:23:50** If it's gone that bad

**01:23:52** Like I don't even think you can get that one

**01:23:55** Problem fixed that you want for the day or the one most important thing you want to do for the day

**01:24:00** You kind of just have to let it go not an easy one. No, it's it's it's not easy at all

**01:24:05** And yeah, I I completely agree with you. That's what I mean by it's difficult to recognize

**01:24:09** The situation sometimes and just say okay this one got lost but it's way better to do that then

**01:24:16** Beat yourself up over it for the rest of the day
