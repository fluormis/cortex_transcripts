# Cortex - 146: Unusually Spiky
**00:00:00** Are you back home now?

**00:00:01** I am.

**00:00:02** I'm back home in my office at a comfortable 16 degrees.

**00:00:07** Yeah.

**00:00:08** We could have an entire episode addressing the thermostat

**00:00:11** follow up, but I don't want to do that.

**00:00:13** And I want to tell you why.

**00:00:15** I want to tell you why I don't want to do that.

**00:00:17** I can't recall getting so much follow up

**00:00:21** about a specific thing in a long time.

**00:00:24** Like, you know, we get lots of follow up

**00:00:25** for like the entire conversation.

**00:00:27** But everyone just sending him follow up

**00:00:29** for one specific thing.

**00:00:30** Now, I want to give you just like a brief overview

**00:00:33** of the feedback that we've got.

**00:00:35** It has ranged from using Faraday cages to how

**00:00:39** to rewire a thermostat to if it's

**00:00:41** legal to rewire a thermostat to if it's dangerous to rewire

**00:00:45** a thermostat to a variety of things

**00:00:47** that people have written into which feel incredibly

**00:00:50** prone to causing fires like using a heat lamp against

**00:00:53** a curtain to how easy this would be for you to do to replace it

**00:00:57** to how hard it would be for you to do to replace it

**00:01:00** to how simple it would be to trick the Wi-Fi

**00:01:03** to how it would be impossible to trick the Wi-Fi

**00:01:05** to whether you were breaking some kind of international law

**00:01:09** or whether it should be your right to do it.

**00:01:11** That is the full summarization of the follow up we have

**00:01:14** received.

**00:01:14** And I will not address any of it because I don't want to.

**00:01:18** Yeah, I don't know why.

**00:01:19** The topic of what temperature is comfortable

**00:01:23** really brings absolutely everybody out in full force.

**00:01:27** My favorite thing is the people that,

**00:01:29** and this is happening a lot in the Discord,

**00:01:31** people will be talking about it.

**00:01:32** And you could tell the moment in which people hear what

**00:01:36** temperature you want.

**00:01:37** It's like people are talking about it and like, oh,

**00:01:39** you know what?

**00:01:40** I agree with Gray.

**00:01:41** You should be able to do this.

**00:01:42** Like, wait, 16 degrees?

**00:01:44** This is the thing that I've seen many, many times.

**00:01:46** People were continually surprised.

**00:01:49** Well, I mean, just look, we don't

**00:01:52** need to rehash this entire thing.

**00:01:54** But in my defense, two things.

**00:01:57** One, I will remind people that this is a working trip for me.

**00:02:01** And when I am working, I'm moving a lot.

**00:02:04** The amount of pacing that I do is huge

**00:02:07** because I'm just thinking about stuff.

**00:02:09** People are totally right.

**00:02:10** Like, that is a very cold temperature

**00:02:12** to just sit still at.

**00:02:15** But that is not what I'm doing.

**00:02:16** It was funny, my wife was just commenting

**00:02:18** on how often she got the little workout updates for me,

**00:02:22** where it's like, oh, your husband just

**00:02:24** finished an indoor walk of seven miles.

**00:02:27** And she knows I'm just pacing back and forth

**00:02:30** in this like 10 foot space.

**00:02:31** OK, that's a good justification for 16 degrees.

**00:02:34** So that is part of the reason is I'm just very active.

**00:02:38** And then the other reason is even if you set the thermostat

**00:02:41** at 16, and even if the thermostat says

**00:02:44** it's working to get the room at that, as we have visited many

**00:02:46** times, hotels can never reach that temperature.

**00:02:50** They're always striving to get there,

**00:02:52** but never actually get there.

**00:02:53** It's like xenothermostat, that's what it's like.

**00:02:55** But yeah, lots of feedback.

**00:02:57** That's the end of it.

**00:02:59** I mean, Mike, of course, no, that's not the end of it.

**00:03:01** It's only the end of it until I go on the next gradation.

**00:03:05** And you can be sure, one way or another,

**00:03:09** I'll be planning ahead for that.

**00:03:11** So when we spoke last, you were on a gradation.

**00:03:15** How was the result of the gradation?

**00:03:16** I know you only just got home again,

**00:03:19** so it was quite a long one.

**00:03:20** Was it valuable?

**00:03:22** Yeah, I think this might have been the longest one I've ever

**00:03:25** been on.

**00:03:26** If it wasn't, it was close.

**00:03:27** Well, from my memory, you could tell me if I'm wrong.

**00:03:30** I think it depends on what you're classing at here,

**00:03:32** because I remember when you were lost in the wilderness

**00:03:34** for a really long time, you just kept adding time

**00:03:37** onto a counter of going to visit various places in the West

**00:03:41** and stuff.

**00:03:42** Yeah, that's different.

**00:03:43** That's different.

**00:03:44** I've done exploratory trips.

**00:03:45** I don't think that would necessarily

**00:03:45** count as a gradation as such.

**00:03:47** You were just around.

**00:03:49** Yeah, I'm trying to remember.

**00:03:50** The longest trip I ever took where I was just away

**00:03:54** from being home on my own was a couple months,

**00:03:57** maybe pushing towards three months.

**00:03:59** But that's different, because, yeah, like you said,

**00:04:01** I'm chaining a bunch of stuff together.

**00:04:04** Why I'm fairly certain this is the longest one of these.

**00:04:08** So again, what am I specifically talking about here?

**00:04:10** So when I say this term, like, gradation,

**00:04:12** I mean it is this dedicated work trip.

**00:04:15** There's nothing else happening.

**00:04:17** I'm not seeing anybody.

**00:04:19** I'm not doing anything in the local town.

**00:04:21** I'm just finding a hotel room and locking myself

**00:04:24** in there to work.

**00:04:26** And part of the reason these trips kind of have a built-in end

**00:04:31** to them is you can only sustain that for so long.

**00:04:35** There are always super productive periods of time,

**00:04:37** but it always feels to me like 10 days is normally

**00:04:43** the maximum amount that I can do for this kind of stuff

**00:04:46** before I start to be like, OK, I'm at the end of this.

**00:04:49** Like, I can't push this anymore.

**00:04:50** But this trip was just going really well,

**00:04:52** so I kept extending it.

**00:04:53** So like I said, I think it was about two,

**00:04:55** two and a half weeks in the end, which is really long for me.

**00:04:58** And yeah, I don't know.

**00:04:59** On this one, I just kept having this feeling like,

**00:05:02** I think at all scales, in-depth work just really benefits

**00:05:07** from how long can you just concentrate on this task.

**00:05:13** And I think maybe part of the reason this one also

**00:05:15** lasted longer than it normally did

**00:05:17** is because I was switching between two things.

**00:05:21** I was working on video stuff for the channel.

**00:05:23** But I was also doing a lot of work for Cortex brand,

**00:05:26** like a bunch of really complicated stuff

**00:05:28** with the Stockatron spreadsheet that we

**00:05:30** have to manage some of our behind-the-scenes logistics.

**00:05:33** And I think maybe it was the bouncing between those two

**00:05:38** kind of allowed me to stay longer than I otherwise

**00:05:42** would have.

**00:05:43** I wasn't burning out on just the one thing.

**00:05:46** I kind of could extend it by having the two.

**00:05:48** Yeah, I don't know.

**00:05:49** I've always just been like a huge fan

**00:05:51** of try to have big blocks of uninterrupted time.

**00:05:55** And I think that really matters.

**00:05:56** Like on the scale of a day, try to have blocks of time.

**00:06:01** And on the scale of a week, try to have blocks of time.

**00:06:03** And this is just me now doing the most extreme version

**00:06:08** possible, which is like, no, just clear the calendar

**00:06:10** for two weeks and try to work on something.

**00:06:12** And yeah, it was really great.

**00:06:14** There's a video project that it won't be anything

**00:06:17** that people guess, because I haven't spoken about it

**00:06:19** publicly.

**00:06:19** But there's a video project that has been on my list for like,

**00:06:24** god, I want to check with the original notice.

**00:06:26** But it must be like eight years now as a thing

**00:06:29** that I've wanted to do.

**00:06:31** But there's something kind of complicated

**00:06:33** about how to execute it.

**00:06:37** And this gradation was the time where it's like, OK,

**00:06:42** I can just sit down and kind of work out

**00:06:44** all of the details of how is this

**00:06:46** going to work in a video in practice

**00:06:48** in a very complicated way.

**00:06:50** I have by far the craziest obsidian canvas sheet

**00:06:54** that I've ever made to connect all the different parts

**00:06:56** of this thing before.

**00:06:58** And I think this video would have stayed on my,

**00:07:04** this is an interesting idea list for like years and years

**00:07:08** if I hadn't done this trip where I could just

**00:07:11** focus on this one thing, keep it all in my head,

**00:07:14** and as a result of just not having any other distractions

**00:07:18** or any other interruptions and being able to mull this over,

**00:07:21** I came up with a bunch of interesting solutions

**00:07:24** for different parts of it that had always been kind of

**00:07:26** stumbling blocks in the past.

**00:07:27** Is this an animated video?

**00:07:29** Yeah, it's going to be an animated video.

**00:07:31** I wasn't sure.

**00:07:32** The complexities, are they like physical or just

**00:07:35** narration, storytelling stuff?

**00:07:36** It's kind of like the storytelling problem, right?

**00:07:39** Sometimes you just have a bunch of stuff and you go like,

**00:07:41** God, how do you even try to talk about this?

**00:07:43** People will see when it's out, but it will be very obvious

**00:07:46** to everyone like, oh, this was a complicated thing to make,

**00:07:50** even though the kind of story of it is very simple.

**00:07:53** And as always, in retrospect, there's a bunch of stuff

**00:07:55** that like once you see how it's done, it's sort of obvious.

**00:07:57** You're like, oh, that's like an obvious idea.

**00:08:00** But trying to work out how to do it like when you haven't

**00:08:04** got the answer already, it's like it's not obvious.

**00:08:06** So yeah, it was great.

**00:08:08** I like walked away from this trip with like,

**00:08:11** script for this video done.

**00:08:13** I have just like a ton of audio to record.

**00:08:15** And that's what I'm going to do over the next few days

**00:08:18** and then pass it off to animation.

**00:08:19** And so like, I genuinely don't feel like I'm jinxing it.

**00:08:23** This is like very on target as a September video for like, great,

**00:08:27** the writing is done.

**00:08:28** I know people sort of think that I'm

**00:08:31** crazy for doing these kinds of trips,

**00:08:33** but they are very clearly net positive.

**00:08:36** And I have a very high success rate of them going really well

**00:08:40** for like, there was something that I

**00:08:42** was having a hard time finishing or figuring out

**00:08:44** or just like a big complicated project.

**00:08:47** And I think it kind of frees up RAM.

**00:08:51** So you can hold more in your head at once and then connections

**00:08:54** that you might not have made otherwise.

**00:08:57** I am like a real weirdo on these trips

**00:09:00** because like I realized when I saw my wife after it was over,

**00:09:05** having to do the thing of like, oh, right,

**00:09:08** aside from like some interactions with the hotel

**00:09:11** staff and the delivery drivers bringing me my dinner,

**00:09:15** like I haven't spoken to anyone on this trip.

**00:09:19** It's just it's very like in my own head.

**00:09:22** And then I have to come out of it at the end of it.

**00:09:25** No, no, no.

**00:09:26** Like I'm trying to find a way to like,

**00:09:28** because you made me think of like silent retreats or whatever.

**00:09:31** I've been intrigued by those kinds of things.

**00:09:33** Yeah.

**00:09:33** I know this is a thing I actually recorded connected

**00:09:37** yesterday and I don't remember how it came up.

**00:09:39** Federico said like, oh, I should try a silent retreat.

**00:09:42** And I was like, I don't think I could

**00:09:43** last on a silent retreat.

**00:09:44** Why don't you think you could last?

**00:09:45** Because I can't stop talking.

**00:09:47** Like that's kind of my problem.

**00:09:49** You know, and so like I feel like I

**00:09:50** would need a noisy retreat is when I say just like just let

**00:09:53** me be really noisy for a week.

**00:09:55** I don't think they have noisy meditation retreats.

**00:09:57** I feel like that's the opposite of what's going on.

**00:09:59** What is that where you scream like that scream therapy?

**00:10:03** Like primal therapy?

**00:10:04** Is that what it's called?

**00:10:05** Is it called primal scream?

**00:10:07** That's what you want for your meditation retreat.

**00:10:09** I always remember.

**00:10:11** Have you ever seen the movie Pirates of Silicon Valley?

**00:10:14** A long time ago.

**00:10:15** Yeah.

**00:10:16** It's like I think made for TV movie about Steve Jobs

**00:10:18** and Bill Gates, which is actually like really good.

**00:10:21** There is a moment where the Steve Jobs character

**00:10:24** is doing primal scream therapy.

**00:10:26** And I always imagined that.

**00:10:28** But anyway, what I was kind of angling towards

**00:10:31** is like people do these things.

**00:10:34** I'm not really sure why someone would do a silent retreat.

**00:10:38** Maybe it's just like a way to just like not

**00:10:41** have to interact with people, maybe

**00:10:42** find a new way to communicate with people.

**00:10:44** I'm not really sure.

**00:10:45** But it's just the way that you describe the graduations

**00:10:47** is like maybe you are getting out

**00:10:49** of those what some people get out of the silent retreat

**00:10:52** because you're not communicating with people.

**00:10:55** It's like it like removes that as a thing you need to do.

**00:10:58** And you're just doing everything it is that you want to do.

**00:11:00** It's just like an interesting, I think,

**00:11:02** byproduct of it more than anything else

**00:11:04** that you just not having to talk to anyone at all.

**00:11:06** The silent retreats, the impression that I've gotten

**00:11:09** and the reason I was interested in them a little bit

**00:11:11** was I've only ever heard them in the context of meditation.

**00:11:14** So the impression that I get is that the silent retreats

**00:11:17** are a way for people who are having a hard time

**00:11:20** with meditation to like boot into how to do this faster.

**00:11:26** And that by not being able to,

**00:11:28** that's like the being silent is forcing you

**00:11:33** to be entirely within your own head.

**00:11:35** And so that like is a fast track into meditation stuff.

**00:11:39** I eventually decided that meditation is just not for me.

**00:11:41** And so I kind of lost interest

**00:11:42** in ever doing something like that.

**00:11:44** But yeah, I think there's a sort of parallel

**00:11:47** in what I'm doing with trying to just remove

**00:11:51** all the outside distractions of life.

**00:11:55** From my perspective though,

**00:11:56** it's really this feeling of like,

**00:11:59** it makes it much easier to hold the entire project

**00:12:03** in my head at once.

**00:12:05** You know, it's like whenever you're working

**00:12:06** on something difficult, there's like this period of like,

**00:12:10** okay, you get up in the morning

**00:12:11** and you're gonna work on the thing.

**00:12:13** And there's always a little bit of like,

**00:12:15** right, let me load it back up into my head.

**00:12:18** And I think just this kind of really intense working time

**00:12:23** really removes that Buddha process

**00:12:25** because it's like, no, no, this is all I was thinking

**00:12:27** about all day and then I went to bed

**00:12:29** and then I got up in the morning

**00:12:30** and it feels like a real continuation of what happened before.

**00:12:33** I think people just don't realize how extreme I'm being

**00:12:35** on these things.

**00:12:35** Like I'm not watching TV, I'm not watching movies.

**00:12:38** I always bring some books with the idea

**00:12:42** that I'm going to read them, but I basically never do.

**00:12:45** With a little asterisk that I finished a business book

**00:12:47** on this trip, but like fiction, I think like,

**00:12:49** oh, I'll have a novel with me to read.

**00:12:51** It's like, I never do, I never do that at all.

**00:12:53** It's just entirely working on the thing and pacing

**00:12:57** and sometimes walking around outside and coming back.

**00:13:00** I think that's why it's like,

**00:13:02** you can hold a complicated project in your head

**00:13:04** and never have to put it down and then never have to like

**00:13:08** get it all back in your head while you're working on it.

**00:15:31** I will say related to that business book,

**00:15:34** there was one thing I was very happy

**00:15:36** was sort of different on this trip

**00:15:38** is of course being in this hotel

**00:15:42** for like two and a half weeks,

**00:15:45** quite obviously only ever leaving the room

**00:15:48** to go get coffee and pick up the meals

**00:15:50** that are being delivered to me in the lobby.

**00:15:52** I stand out very fast to the staff.

**00:15:56** They just noticed me and I think quite rightly,

**00:16:01** after a certain period of time,

**00:16:03** you could tell the staff is like,

**00:16:05** what is this guy doing?

**00:16:07** Like what is this guy's just like living in our hotel?

**00:16:10** And it's extra weird because I was staying

**00:16:13** in a really touristy location.

**00:16:15** So everyone else in that hotel was clearly there

**00:16:19** for touristy stuff.

**00:16:20** And then there's me, right?

**00:16:21** The one person who's not.

**00:16:23** The air conditioning guy.

**00:16:24** Right, the air conditioning guy.

**00:16:25** The guy who was there on day one.

**00:16:27** Mr. Freeze over here.

**00:16:29** Yes, we only ever see him go to the gym

**00:16:34** and go to the coffee machine.

**00:16:36** Those are the two things he does.

**00:16:37** And then he picks up the deliveries.

**00:16:40** That's it, housekeeping.

**00:16:42** No, he doesn't want it.

**00:16:44** Please don't come into the room.

**00:16:46** And so one of the members of staff,

**00:16:49** I imagine someone who drew the short straw

**00:16:52** clearly tried to work up a conversation with me

**00:16:55** to be like, what are you doing in this hotel?

**00:16:58** We just want to make sure everything's OK.

**00:17:01** The housekeeping staff hasn't been in.

**00:17:03** What are you doing in there?

**00:17:05** It felt to me like it was the friendly version

**00:17:07** of the time in Las Vegas where they brought security

**00:17:10** to my hotel room for the same reason.

**00:17:12** They're like, we need to know what's happening inside this room.

**00:17:14** I was about to say, oh, I forgot that was you.

**00:17:18** Because that was a thing of they needed

**00:17:20** to make sure there wasn't something real bad going on.

**00:17:23** Yeah, of course.

**00:17:24** In Vegas, they will.

**00:17:25** If housekeeping can't get in over a certain period of time,

**00:17:28** they're just going to come in.

**00:17:29** They're just coming in.

**00:17:30** It was the manager and a very big man

**00:17:33** behind him in Las Vegas wanted to check out the room.

**00:17:37** I was like, oh, I'm just on gray master time.

**00:17:39** So the housekeeping schedule and my schedule

**00:17:41** hasn't overlapped.

**00:17:42** So yeah, anyway, the guy who drew the short straw

**00:17:46** clearly wanted to strike up a little conversation with me

**00:17:48** while I was getting coffee to be like, so what are you doing?

**00:17:50** And I was very happy because I had a completely legitimate answer.

**00:17:57** I don't want to say what I'm really doing.

**00:17:59** Oh, I'm writing all this time because that is like,

**00:18:03** what do you write?

**00:18:04** And I don't want to have to say any of these things.

**00:18:06** So I was able to say the truth, which is, oh, I'm

**00:18:10** the logistics manager for a company.

**00:18:12** We finally got into it.

**00:18:15** I was so happy.

**00:18:16** I was like, what I do is I work on logistics spreadsheets,

**00:18:20** but they're really complicated.

**00:18:22** There are hundreds of thousands of rows of calculations.

**00:18:25** And so I find it easier just to lock myself in a room

**00:18:29** and work on these big spreadsheets

**00:18:32** without interruptions.

**00:18:33** So that's what I'm here for.

**00:18:34** I'm just like working.

**00:18:35** And I was so happy because I could see in his head, he went, ah.

**00:18:39** Boring.

**00:18:41** Boring nerd, right?

**00:18:43** He hit the two check boxes, and then they're like,

**00:18:46** this guy is no problem.

**00:18:48** We don't have to worry about it.

**00:18:49** Yeah, story checks out.

**00:18:52** Yeah.

**00:18:52** That's great.

**00:18:53** I also can imagine, right, I fit the look of a person who's like,

**00:18:57** I'm working on these spreadsheets.

**00:18:58** Would you like to know more about my spreadsheets?

**00:19:00** No, I would not like to know more about your spreadsheets.

**00:19:02** Maybe less time in the gym, though, I feel like,

**00:19:05** to fully complete.

**00:19:06** I think it can still check out because they realize,

**00:19:09** they don't know I'm pacing for miles back and forth.

**00:19:11** That's true.

**00:19:11** So from their perspective, this is the only physical activity

**00:19:16** that I'm doing.

**00:19:17** And also, if they're spying on me with the security

**00:19:20** camera that's in the gym, I'm not down there

**00:19:22** lifting massive weights.

**00:19:24** Like, I'm at the very small end of those barbells

**00:19:28** for the weights that I'm doing.

**00:19:29** So it still checks out for the nerd story.

**00:19:31** I was very happy to have the first real instance

**00:19:35** of being able to report that I'm a logistics manager.

**00:19:39** Nothing interesting to see here.

**00:19:41** Move right along.

**00:19:43** This is kind of incredible because this has actually

**00:19:46** just been a weird thing where a joke that we had years ago

**00:19:51** has come true.

**00:19:52** We had a conversation years ago about explaining

**00:19:57** what you do in a situation where you just

**00:20:00** don't want to deal with the follow up questions.

**00:20:03** Because I have this, I'm a podcaster.

**00:20:06** What podcast?

**00:20:07** Oh, what do you do?

**00:20:09** Like, you record?

**00:20:10** It's like, yeah, I have a podcast production company.

**00:20:12** So what is your show?

**00:20:14** And it's like, no, I have a bunch.

**00:20:15** And I'm like, what are they about?

**00:20:17** And I'm like, tech and creativity.

**00:20:19** And people go, oh.

**00:20:21** And then the conversation ends.

**00:20:22** So sometimes it's just easier to say a different thing.

**00:20:25** So for me now, I say, oh, I run a product design company.

**00:20:28** And we make notebooks and stuff.

**00:20:30** And that's the thing.

**00:20:31** I feel like I can have more interesting conversations

**00:20:34** with people about because everyone can understand that

**00:20:36** rather than like, so I record podcasts with people

**00:20:39** in America mostly about technology.

**00:20:42** And it's like, I don't want to have this conversation.

**00:20:44** It's what people's eyes say to me.

**00:20:46** And so we had a conversation about this years ago

**00:20:49** of how to try and explain what you do.

**00:20:51** And back then, I said that I was an advertising logistics

**00:20:55** manager because I managed the logistics of ads.

**00:20:58** And you were like, oh, that sounds good.

**00:21:00** That's like an idea.

**00:21:02** And so now it's taken all this time.

**00:21:03** And now you are actually legitimately a logistics manager

**00:21:08** for a company that produces productivity tools.

**00:21:10** Yeah, I used to have an answer that I stumbled around

**00:21:13** with advertising.

**00:21:15** But it never worked.

**00:21:16** I never liked it.

**00:21:18** It's also the thing of like, I just

**00:21:19** don't want to straight up lie about what I do.

**00:21:22** No, because it's silly.

**00:21:23** It's silly to do.

**00:21:24** It's also a thing of like, why keep track of this in your head?

**00:21:28** Also, boy, are you in for 10 times more trouble

**00:21:31** if someone follows this up at the hotel

**00:21:33** and now it's like the weird guy lied about what

**00:21:35** he does for a living.

**00:21:36** So I just never wanted to do that.

**00:21:38** And I just never had a satisfying answer.

**00:21:40** But that's why this logistics what?

**00:21:42** I was like, oh my god, it's completely legitimate.

**00:21:44** I really am working on a spreadsheet

**00:21:46** for like hours at a time in this hotel room.

**00:21:49** This is like a perfectly legitimate, maximum boring

**00:21:53** answer that I could give to people now

**00:21:55** when they ask about my work.

**00:21:56** So I was very happy about that.

**00:22:00** Because that's what we're going to do in the show anyway,

**00:22:02** right?

**00:22:02** Like, badoop, badoop, right?

**00:22:03** It probably won't be the ad sound.

**00:22:05** It will be like the badaloop, that one.

**00:22:08** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**00:22:08** We'll do it.

**00:22:08** Yeah, that's a little bit.

**00:22:10** Ting, ting.

**00:22:11** I don't know.

**00:22:11** I don't know how it goes.

**00:22:12** Do you like it?

**00:22:14** What was that one?

**00:22:15** Wait, how does our not ad break sound go?

**00:22:19** I can't think of it.

**00:22:20** It is blue loop?

**00:22:21** Yeah, no, no, no.

**00:22:22** It's badaloop, badaloop.

**00:22:24** You're doing the badaloop.

**00:22:25** That's the ad sound.

**00:22:27** Right.

**00:22:28** But the one where it's just moving to the next topic

**00:22:31** is it's almost like the highest note is reversed.

**00:22:34** Oh, OK.

**00:22:37** Yes, I've edited this show many times.

**00:22:40** And I still can't pull it into my head what that sounds like.

**00:22:43** That sound, sometimes you don't hear it.

**00:22:45** The most uses of that sound, the change topic sound,

**00:22:47** go in more text.

**00:22:48** Yeah.

**00:22:49** Which you don't hear that, because I

**00:22:50** add it in when you're done.

**00:22:51** Yeah, but I still hear the sound.

**00:22:53** I listen to the show when it goes live.

**00:22:54** Like, I hear the sound.

**00:22:55** I didn't know you did that.

**00:22:56** I hear the sound.

**00:22:56** OK.

**00:22:57** I just can't think of what it is.

**00:22:57** But whatever.

**00:22:58** This is going to be a topic change now.

**00:23:01** It's September.

**00:23:01** September.

**00:23:02** September is Childhood Cancer Awareness Month.

**00:23:04** And for the fifth year in a row, we

**00:23:07** are once again as a community coming together at Relay-FM

**00:23:10** to support the lifesaving work of St. Jude Children's Research

**00:23:13** Hospital.

**00:23:14** St. Jude have a simple mission.

**00:23:17** Their mission is to keep working until no child dies

**00:23:20** from cancer.

**00:23:21** With your support, we'll be one step closer to that day.

**00:23:25** One cure closer, one child closer.

**00:23:28** So we, over the last five years, have raised $2.2 million

**00:23:33** for the kids of St. Jude.

**00:23:36** Wow.

**00:23:36** Which is an incredible thing to achieve,

**00:23:40** and I think is an even more incredible thing

**00:23:42** to achieve considering the size of our community.

**00:23:45** It is an absolutely obscene amount of money.

**00:23:49** And we've already started very strong.

**00:23:52** We're actually recording this episode

**00:23:54** the last day of August, and we've passed $100,000.

**00:23:57** Yeah, I was just loading it up, and I just

**00:23:59** flipped over to $103,000 raised.

**00:24:03** And you started how many days ago?

**00:24:07** On Monday.

**00:24:07** So like three or four days ago.

**00:24:10** Every year, like you said, it's incredible just

**00:24:13** how generous all the listeners are with this as a donation.

**00:24:18** Every year, I'm shocked by the results.

**00:24:20** And it's incredible.

**00:24:22** The generosity is so incredible of people.

**00:24:25** And I think it works.

**00:24:27** This is a charity that does incredible stuff,

**00:24:30** and we have such a personal connection to it.

**00:24:32** We've mentioned this before, but my co-founder Stephen,

**00:24:35** his son, Josiah, Josiah's life was saved by St. Jude.

**00:24:39** He was born with a brain tumor.

**00:24:41** And without the work of St. Jude,

**00:24:44** we don't know what would have happened.

**00:24:46** St. Jude is an incredible place, and they

**00:24:49** looked after Josiah the same way that they

**00:24:51** look after hundreds, thousands of children.

**00:24:55** And they beat these cancers.

**00:24:58** They beat these life-threatening diseases.

**00:25:00** When St. Jude was established, it was opened in 1962.

**00:25:05** At that time, childhood cancer was

**00:25:07** considered to be basically an incurable thing, cancer

**00:25:11** in general, but especially childhood cancer.

**00:25:13** And the treatments that have been developed at St. Jude

**00:25:16** have helped to push the cancer survival rate from 20%

**00:25:21** in children to more than 80% in the years

**00:25:24** that it's been opening in 60 years

**00:25:25** that St. Jude's been around.

**00:25:27** But look, as with all of these things, I mean, let's be real.

**00:25:30** What about the other 20?

**00:25:32** 80% is not enough.

**00:25:33** It needs to be 100%.

**00:25:35** Pediatric cancer is still the leading cause

**00:25:38** of death by disease among US children aged 14 years and younger,

**00:25:43** and it's worse in other countries all around the world,

**00:25:45** too.

**00:25:46** And that is something about St. Jude.

**00:25:48** St. Jude is a hospital in Memphis, Tennessee.

**00:25:50** It just so happens to be where Stephen and his family

**00:25:53** are from, just complete luck, really.

**00:25:55** But while they are an institution in Memphis, Tennessee,

**00:25:58** which is both a research hospital,

**00:26:00** so they treat children there, but they also

**00:26:02** research these diseases, they share that work with the world.

**00:26:06** They care for patients from all over the world.

**00:26:10** That's the thing that they do.

**00:26:11** And also, none of these families ever

**00:26:14** receive a bill from St. Jude.

**00:26:16** They cover housing, travel, food, and treatment.

**00:26:20** So families can just focus on making sure

**00:26:23** that their child can be as happy as they can be

**00:26:25** and that their child can live.

**00:26:27** That is what they are focused on.

**00:26:29** And all the time, they are learning more

**00:26:31** about childhood cancer.

**00:26:32** They are learning more about other life-threatening diseases.

**00:26:35** And they share this information with the world.

**00:26:37** This cutting-edge research that they have,

**00:26:40** they share the results of it.

**00:26:41** And every year, I get to speak to different doctors

**00:26:45** and researchers in the all-around St. Jude

**00:26:48** institution, and I'm always blown away

**00:26:50** by the depths that they are going to try and understand

**00:26:55** stuff.

**00:26:55** Last year, I spoke to a neuroscientist,

**00:26:59** I think would be the phrase, who works at St. Jude.

**00:27:02** And they were looking into what can they

**00:27:05** understand about the brain?

**00:27:07** And is there some kind of link between something

**00:27:09** going on in the brain and cancer cells being developed?

**00:27:12** They come at this from every single possible angle.

**00:27:15** And that's how they have these breakthroughs there.

**00:27:18** But all of that work, both treating the children that

**00:27:22** are there and working on the research

**00:27:26** to push this stuff forward, it takes time, effort, and most

**00:27:29** importantly, money.

**00:27:31** And St. Jude, they are donor-led.

**00:27:33** They're donor-focused.

**00:27:34** That's how this stuff is all paid for.

**00:27:37** It is by the generosity of people like our listeners,

**00:27:41** who have donated now millions of dollars

**00:27:44** to help the kids of St. Jude.

**00:27:45** Yeah, this is the kind of thing that it's worth funding.

**00:27:50** The thing to me that is always very impressive

**00:27:52** is just how they share their results.

**00:27:56** That, to me, is one of the biggest things here.

**00:27:59** This is not medical research that

**00:28:00** is going to be locked away.

**00:28:03** It's not proprietary.

**00:28:04** What they can figure out to make things better for kids,

**00:28:07** they are sharing.

**00:28:08** And I think that's just fantastic as an organization.

**00:28:11** I'd give a little bit of information about that.

**00:28:13** In 2018, St. Jude became the first and only

**00:28:16** World Health Organization Collaborating Center

**00:28:19** for Childhood Cancer.

**00:28:20** The goal of this initiative is to raise

**00:28:22** the survival rate of the six common childhood cancers

**00:28:25** to 60% by 2030.

**00:28:27** They have 280 partners as part of their St. Jude Global

**00:28:31** initiative as well.

**00:28:32** It represents more than 70 countries and growing.

**00:28:35** So they can share their research out everywhere.

**00:28:39** They want to put this out around the world.

**00:28:41** And also, if you think about it,

**00:28:42** for a research institution, the more information

**00:28:46** they can find out, the better.

**00:28:48** But for us at Relay FM, it just so

**00:28:51** happens to be in the company's backyard.

**00:28:54** And so it is like the absolute, for every single reason,

**00:28:57** perfect charity for us to turn our attention to every year.

**00:29:01** We are so incredibly grateful for the generosity

**00:29:03** that the community has shown over the last five years.

**00:29:06** We are asking, once again, for you

**00:29:08** to support the lifesaving mission of St. Jude.

**00:29:11** We are aiming this year to push our overall amount raised

**00:29:16** to over $2.5 million.

**00:29:18** That's where our goal is right now.

**00:29:19** If we hit the goal that we've set,

**00:29:21** which is just under $300,000, we will

**00:29:23** have passed $2.5 million together.

**00:29:26** But obviously, we want it to go even further.

**00:29:29** Please go to stjude.org slash Relay.

**00:29:31** If you make a donation of your own,

**00:29:33** if you donate $60 or more, we send out some digital stuff

**00:29:36** to you, wallpapers and screensavers.

**00:29:38** If you donate $100 or more, we send out stickers.

**00:29:41** But you can also set up the fundraise.

**00:29:43** This is one of the ways that you can do something also

**00:29:47** to get even more money.

**00:29:48** Like if you can't afford it, or you can only

**00:29:50** afford a small amount, you could set up a fundraising

**00:29:52** campaign of your own.

**00:29:53** You could talk to your friends, your family, your own community,

**00:29:56** and raise more money for the kids of St. Jude that way.

**00:29:59** Fundraisers who raise at least $1

**00:30:01** will receive a challenge coin.

**00:30:03** Fundraisers who raise $250 or more

**00:30:06** will receive this desk mat with just the most

**00:30:08** incredible design.

**00:30:09** It's so good.

**00:30:11** You can go to stjude.org slash Relay.

**00:30:13** You can see these designs there.

**00:30:15** And you can also find out more.

**00:31:01** So you mentioned as part of your high on grammar

**00:31:04** and spreadsheets discussion earlier

**00:31:07** that you took a business book on your gradation.

**00:31:11** I took the book I mentioned before, Mike.

**00:31:12** I took Understanding Variation, The Key

**00:31:15** to Managing Chaos by Donald J. Wheeler.

**00:31:18** The classic.

**00:31:22** OK.

**00:31:22** So for context, this was the book

**00:31:25** that you were referencing a little while ago.

**00:31:28** We spoke about it on the show where me and you

**00:31:30** were having a conversation.

**00:31:32** And I just didn't understand any of the words you were saying.

**00:31:36** But it was all about logistics management.

**00:31:38** OK, yeah.

**00:31:39** So I picked up this book because my goal was,

**00:31:42** I wanted to read what mathematical tools do people

**00:31:46** in business use?

**00:31:48** Because as head of logistics, this is now my responsibility.

**00:31:51** And instead of just playing around with spreadsheets

**00:31:55** with some of my old physics stuff,

**00:31:57** it's like, let me see how business people do this.

**00:31:59** I can't remember how, but I somehow

**00:32:00** stumbled upon this book as a place to start.

**00:32:03** We sort of mentioned it a while ago.

**00:32:05** And I started reading it.

**00:32:07** I implemented some of the things.

**00:32:08** And then I was like, you know what?

**00:32:09** I want to make sure I finish this.

**00:32:10** So I did bring it on the trip.

**00:32:11** And I did.

**00:32:12** My only recreational reading on the entire 2 and 1-1-1-2 weeks

**00:32:16** was this book, I guess.

**00:32:18** And I was like, oh, we should make a cortex book

**00:32:21** club out of this, right?

**00:32:22** This totally makes it.

**00:32:23** And then I thought, I can't do that to Mike.

**00:32:25** I'm not going to make Mike read this book.

**00:32:27** That's a terrible idea.

**00:32:28** Let me tell you, I want to just let you know right now.

**00:32:30** That wasn't going to happen.

**00:32:32** No.

**00:32:32** Because I just know I wouldn't have been able to do it.

**00:32:34** OK, all right.

**00:32:35** So that just was never really on the table.

**00:32:36** No, because I mean, I could have tried.

**00:32:38** None of the information is going to stick in my head.

**00:32:41** It would have been, I feel like it would have just

**00:32:43** been a wasted book club.

**00:32:44** Yeah, but I sent you the one joke that was in the book.

**00:32:46** And you enjoyed that part.

**00:32:47** I did enjoy that.

**00:32:49** But I feel like maybe that was the only part I

**00:32:51** would have enjoyed.

**00:32:52** Can you explain roughly what that was?

**00:32:56** Because it is kind of a very strange thing

**00:32:58** to put in a book like this, I think.

**00:32:59** I'll tell the joke in a second.

**00:33:01** Here was my pitch, right?

**00:33:02** I was thinking, I like this book.

**00:33:04** We have a show.

**00:33:05** We talk about business stuff.

**00:33:07** This is now part of it.

**00:33:08** I was like, we should do it as a Cortex book club.

**00:33:10** I can't subject Mike, my friend, to that.

**00:33:13** That would just be cruel.

**00:33:15** That would be no good.

**00:33:16** So what I wanted to do is I just wanted

**00:33:18** to give a super quick kind of mini one-sided Cortex book

**00:33:24** club just on this book that I read.

**00:33:26** So it just didn't hang as a thing that we mentioned

**00:33:28** and never came back.

**00:33:30** So I just wanted to run through.

**00:33:33** I think this actually is useful for people

**00:33:35** with small businesses.

**00:33:36** And I just wanted to do like, here's

**00:33:39** some key parts for this.

**00:33:41** But the thing that I sent to Mike,

**00:33:42** there's this kind of effect.

**00:33:45** You're reading a book.

**00:33:46** It's very dry.

**00:33:47** I don't know how to even explain this.

**00:33:49** This really looks like the kind of book

**00:33:51** that was written on a typewriter.

**00:33:52** I don't know if that's true, but somehow it just

**00:33:54** gives me that feeling.

**00:33:55** It's very mathy kind of book.

**00:33:58** But then sometimes there's just a little bit of a joke in a way.

**00:34:03** And so this book is running you through a bunch of examples

**00:34:07** of here's how to analyze this data from this business.

**00:34:10** And then all of a sudden, a third of the way in,

**00:34:15** he just makes this comment.

**00:34:16** He's like, oh, here, take a look at this figure for pounds

**00:34:19** scrapped in July for this company.

**00:34:22** And then he says, do these comparisons

**00:34:24** answer all of your questions about the scrap levels

**00:34:26** in this process?

**00:34:28** Are you ready to go on to some other line in the monthly report?

**00:34:32** Surely this must be enough.

**00:34:34** And then you like, a few pages later in the book,

**00:34:37** he picks it up with like, did you

**00:34:40** feel satisfied with the treatment of the scrapped pounds

**00:34:43** data given on page 73?

**00:34:45** If you did, you should skip this section.

**00:34:47** In fact, you might as well skip the rest of the book.

**00:34:51** You have a terminal case of numerical illiteracy.

**00:34:55** What is wrong with this guy?

**00:34:59** I thought it was like, I took it as a very funny joke

**00:35:02** in a way because it's like, no one on Earth

**00:35:06** who is reading this book is going

**00:35:08** to be the person with the case of terminal illiteracy.

**00:35:12** He waits until you're well into this very boring book

**00:35:16** to drop a little thing and then be like, oh, hey, this chart.

**00:35:20** Are you happy with this chart?

**00:35:21** We'll just come back to that later.

**00:35:23** And then he's like, hey, remember that chart?

**00:35:25** You weren't happy at all, right?

**00:35:26** Of course you weren't.

**00:35:27** Now let's go into why you shouldn't be happy with this.

**00:35:30** But it's just like such a weird tone shift

**00:35:32** in the middle of what is otherwise

**00:35:34** like incredibly dry writing.

**00:35:36** No, but you see, that is funny, right?

**00:35:38** But if I put it through the lens of a Cortex Book Club book,

**00:35:42** that's the part where I would have broken the camel's back

**00:35:45** for me.

**00:35:45** Yeah, no, no.

**00:35:46** That would have been furious if you

**00:35:48** would be forced to read this.

**00:35:50** Oh, so you just made me read this whole thing

**00:35:53** and it was pointless.

**00:35:55** Right?

**00:35:56** Can you imagine?

**00:35:58** Just this chapter or whatever.

**00:35:59** Oh, you're reading this information?

**00:36:01** OK.

**00:36:01** This guy literally wastes the reader's time.

**00:36:05** Like 100% he is doing that just to prove a point to,

**00:36:09** like, I don't know, Jim or something.

**00:36:11** I imagine this is solely focused on an individual in his life

**00:36:16** that did this.

**00:36:18** It is a little bit like the thinking fast and slow thing

**00:36:21** where he's like, hey, why don't you solve this problem?

**00:36:23** And then like, oh, actually, right?

**00:36:25** That was impossible to solve.

**00:36:27** Ha ha, you fell into my logic puzzle.

**00:36:30** Did you think that person was a banker?

**00:36:32** You're wrong for dumb reasons.

**00:36:33** I'm just like, yeah, great, thank you.

**00:36:36** What I particularly love, what really charmed me

**00:36:38** about this little interlude from the guy,

**00:36:40** so he does this thing about like,

**00:36:42** you know, you turn a little, a little, a little, see, whatever.

**00:36:43** But then he says, like, for all of you

**00:36:45** who felt a bit cheated by that previous graph,

**00:36:48** like, let's go on to analyze the data in a more satisfying way.

**00:36:52** When I was reading the book, I genuinely

**00:36:54** did have the experience of like, I do feel cheated

**00:36:57** on that report of monthly scrapped pounds in July.

**00:37:00** Like, that is not an adequate data table at all.

**00:37:03** I would like to continue the story, please.

**00:37:05** So yeah, this is like a very weird book to have read.

**00:37:09** But I genuinely really liked it, and I found it super useful.

**00:37:13** Basically, here's my little summary of what this is.

**00:37:16** And like, if anybody listening runs a small business,

**00:37:21** and you either deal with inventory,

**00:37:24** or you have some kind of quality control issue,

**00:37:27** where it's like, OK, you need to make sure

**00:37:29** that there's not a certain number of errors,

**00:37:30** you know, higher than every 100 or whatever.

**00:37:33** I think this book is totally worth reading and looking

**00:37:37** through if you're not really using anything

**00:37:40** to track this kind of stuff.

**00:37:41** What do you mean if you're not using something to track it?

**00:37:44** Is you saying the idea of like, this

**00:37:46** will help you establish something

**00:37:48** so you could track it?

**00:37:49** Yeah, so you have a problem.

**00:37:51** The problem that we had is we were just

**00:37:54** kind of guessing about how much stock to buy every time

**00:37:58** we had to make an order.

**00:37:59** We were doing the thing of like, oh, this number of theme system

**00:38:03** journals is low.

**00:38:04** And then we like lick our thumb and hold it up to the wind

**00:38:06** and go like, I don't know, how many more should we buy?

**00:38:09** What does it feel like?

**00:38:10** Well, Mike would say he used his gut,

**00:38:12** but that isn't a good way to make decisions.

**00:38:13** But that was what I was doing.

**00:38:15** You know, like I felt like there was some knowledge going there,

**00:38:17** but it wasn't actual math of any kind.

**00:38:19** Yeah, exactly.

**00:38:20** And tons of businesses, just like ours,

**00:38:24** can get by on like gut decisions for a really long time.

**00:38:29** So I think this is like a good book.

**00:38:32** If you're in that position, like you've been doing a thing.

**00:38:34** You've been kind of just like eyeballing it this whole time.

**00:38:38** But maybe you want to try to be a bit more rigorous about like

**00:38:42** knowing exactly what you need to buy.

**00:38:45** Or again, a lot of his examples are in the,

**00:38:48** they're not as relevant for us, but it's

**00:38:50** in the case of like errors per widget kind of problems

**00:38:54** that you're dealing with.

**00:38:55** And so like, how do you track this?

**00:38:57** And the basic concept is what he calls a process control chart,

**00:39:02** which that's where this title comes from,

**00:39:04** like the key to managing chaos, right?

**00:39:06** The idea is you want to try to get all of your systems under control.

**00:39:11** And by this, he's talking about statistical control.

**00:39:13** And really what you're just doing is say, take whatever data you have.

**00:39:18** In our case, it's like notebooks sold per day.

**00:39:21** You track them by time and you just make a little graph over time

**00:39:27** that shows you what is the average results.

**00:39:31** And he walks through some steps of how to create a little line on that graph.

**00:39:36** Which basically is a line where you can say, hey,

**00:39:40** if your daily numbers ever cross this line,

**00:39:44** something very different has happened and you need to investigate

**00:39:48** what that different thing is.

**00:39:50** Ah, OK.

**00:39:51** This is like unlocking a thing that I've just been hearing from you a lot recently,

**00:39:56** which is these kinds of ideas of like, oh, we need to make this change or do this

**00:40:02** or analyze this or test this because the graph changed.

**00:40:07** Like you keep referencing like the language is different,

**00:40:10** but like there has been a statistical outlier here.

**00:40:14** Why? And we need to look into that.

**00:40:16** So one of the points he makes in the book, which I think is really good,

**00:40:20** is everyone just kind of underestimates how random things can be in life.

**00:40:28** And so this is one of the things that we deal with in our business,

**00:40:31** is our data in physics, you would say the data is very noisy.

**00:40:35** But what I mean by that is the daily sales can vary a lot for just like totally

**00:40:40** inscrutable reasons, right?

**00:40:41** We have days where it's like, oh, we sold four times as many as the day before.

**00:40:45** Why? No idea. Right.

**00:40:46** Well, we sold none today. Yeah.

**00:40:49** OK, it's very strange.

**00:40:52** Well, like we reference Saturdays before.

**00:40:54** But now Saturdays in the last couple of weeks have been fine.

**00:40:57** And Sundays have been a problem.

**00:40:59** I swear to like this is one of these things.

**00:41:00** I swear to God, it's like the universe heard us talk and heard us that we figured

**00:41:07** out that Saturday was a bad sales day.

**00:41:09** And like ever since that episode, Saturday sales have gone up.

**00:41:13** I mean, the thing here that I've considered is maybe it's not the universe.

**00:41:17** Maybe it's just literally our listeners.

**00:41:19** Yeah, it could be that.

**00:41:20** Like it is not the universe.

**00:41:22** Like there are people that heard us say it.

**00:41:23** And maybe they're like, oh, I want to buy a thesis in general.

**00:41:26** Oh, I'll get it on Saturday instead.

**00:41:29** Right. Yeah. Just like mess up the chart.

**00:41:31** Yeah. So in computer science, you'd call that an adversarial situation.

**00:41:35** Right. You're trying to figure out a pattern and there is an adversary working

**00:41:38** against you're trying to figure out the pattern.

**00:41:39** Most businesses don't have to deal with that.

**00:41:44** I was just filling in some of the sales data yesterday.

**00:41:47** And it's like, oh, on that note, I think that you've filled in the chart.

**00:41:52** I was very surprised the other day.

**00:41:54** I opened our spreadsheet and was like, hang on a minute.

**00:41:57** The numbers are already in here.

**00:41:58** I was very confused about this because I put the numbers in and you put the numbers in.

**00:42:04** This was very strange to me.

**00:42:06** Mike gave me the back end login.

**00:42:08** Yeah. Some of the data has been locked away from me.

**00:42:11** And so, of course, no, no, I'm going to obsessively check that information.

**00:42:16** The difference was like you could have always looked at the cotton bureau and got the information,

**00:42:20** but you just never asked for the login information.

**00:42:23** But we have recently set up a team one password.

**00:42:25** So now you do have it, whether you asked for it or not.

**00:42:29** I was never keeping it from you.

**00:42:30** However, there is a thing which does make me nervous, which is like you could just delete the products now.

**00:42:36** I'm not saying you would.

**00:42:37** Yeah, obviously. I get it, though.

**00:42:39** Like whenever you start sharing information with other people for like the dashboard that controls everything,

**00:42:44** it's very nervous, right, no matter how much you trust.

**00:42:46** Because it's like I mean, I've used this stuff for ages and I've never explained anything to you.

**00:42:51** And I've seen the system grow and I know how to use it.

**00:42:54** And now, like you're using it and it's like, oh, God, I know you can.

**00:42:57** But also, it's terrifying.

**00:43:02** Well, Mike, you never have to worry because I am only obsessively interested in one thing,

**00:43:08** which is completing the spreadsheet.

**00:43:10** That's true.

**00:43:11** But this is good, though, because now I don't need to fill in the data in the spreadsheet.

**00:43:14** Yes, I guarantee you, I will always fill that in sooner than you will fill that in,

**00:43:18** because I'm just like desperate to get the logistics, statistical updates.

**00:43:21** Yeah, I did wonder sometimes.

**00:43:23** I'm surprised you haven't asked sooner because sometimes I'd open a spreadsheet and be like,

**00:43:26** oh, I haven't been here in a week.

**00:43:27** And there was also a part of me that's like, how does Grey feel about that?

**00:43:31** Like, does he want, would he have liked it to have been quicker?

**00:43:34** Because I feel like every time I open the spreadsheet, there's always a note that Grey has made a change.

**00:43:41** Always.

**00:43:41** Every single time I open the spreadsheet, it's like there have been changes to the spreadsheet.

**00:43:46** And I learned a long time ago that there was no point in me checking those

**00:43:49** because I didn't understand what was happening.

**00:43:52** Like, it was all like formula and stuff.

**00:43:54** But like, that was always funny to me.

**00:43:57** And I would think, I go, am I, you know, I try and do every few days or whatever,

**00:44:00** but sometimes a week might go by.

**00:44:02** And I was always just thinking in the back of my mind, like, is he opening it every day?

**00:44:05** And it's like, there's no new day or in here, but now you can do it yourself.

**00:44:10** I will not tell you how often I checked that spreadsheet to see if you had updated things.

**00:44:14** I will just say it was one of my like prouder social restraint moments of Grey.

**00:44:22** Don't harass Mike about this.

**00:44:24** The frequency that he updates the data for our decision making process is fine.

**00:44:30** Like, your obsessive weirdness about wanting up to the minute data

**00:44:35** does not change any decision Mike has to make.

**00:44:39** So don't ask him.

**00:44:40** So that's what I told myself that numerous times of like, don't bother Mike about this.

**00:44:44** This is not relevant.

**00:44:45** Well, you have a 100% success rate.

**00:44:48** You've never asked me.

**00:44:49** So that is good.

**00:44:51** I'm very pleased with myself for that.

**00:44:52** I'm not going to lie.

**00:44:53** It was quite hard sometimes.

**00:44:55** You deserve the commendation for it because I understand it.

**00:44:57** Because I mean, I guess this is maybe somewhat frustrating for you.

**00:45:01** I check the date or a couple of times a day.

**00:45:04** Right.

**00:45:05** Like, I look to see what the sales are mostly on the psychic notepad, like once or twice a day.

**00:45:10** Like, it's a tab that I have open in Safari.

**00:45:12** But I don't then take that information and put it in there because it's also like...

**00:45:16** Boy, I'm glad you didn't tell me that.

**00:45:18** I'm glad I didn't know that.

**00:45:19** But it's also because it's not helpful, right?

**00:45:21** Because like, to me, it's like, well,

**00:45:23** it's only helpful for me to put the information in when the day is completed.

**00:45:26** And so like, I would just do it every two or three days, maybe mostly.

**00:45:31** But that is funny of like, yeah, I mean, I do check the information frequently,

**00:45:35** but there was just nothing I could do with the spreadsheet.

**00:45:37** So I'll just leave that there a little while to go.

**00:47:40** A thanks to Memberful for the support of this show and Relay FM.

**00:47:44** I do have this weird thing of like I never quite know what I should tell you and what

**00:47:48** I shouldn't tell you and I really want to try to not overwhelm you with like everything

**00:47:53** that's happening because it just doesn't matter.

**00:47:55** We have a similar thing here, right?

**00:47:57** Like you don't try and give me too much information about the sales tracking and the

**00:48:03** inventory tracking and I don't give you too much information about the product design

**00:48:08** process.

**00:48:09** I'm talking to manufacturers and our partners a lot but I'm not giving you all of the information.

**00:48:15** You find out when there is a critical thing that needs to be discussed.

**00:48:18** Part of what this book is kind of getting at in a way I can translate as how do you

**00:48:25** know when something is critical?

**00:48:28** So like how do you know when there is something that you need to discuss with your business

**00:48:32** partner about this, right?

**00:48:34** If you're running a business and you have this kind of division, one of you is like

**00:48:37** the back end math person and the other person is like the front end person and dealing

**00:48:41** with other things.

**00:48:42** Like how do you know when you need to discuss things with the other person?

**00:48:46** And this is what I was saying before about the data can be really variable on any particular

**00:48:52** day.

**00:48:53** I think we have an unusually spiky business.

**00:48:56** I think that's a byproduct of both doing this show and it kind of being a business that's

**00:49:01** on the internet so I think there's more things that can just randomly affect sales.

**00:49:06** So the real question is how do you answer a question like say one of our products has

**00:49:11** zero sales on a day and then it has zero sales again.

**00:49:15** Two days in a row, is that something to worry about or is that within the realm of chance?

**00:49:22** Or on the flip side of it, right?

**00:49:23** If you have like, oh, sales have doubled one day and then there's still doubled again the

**00:49:28** next day, has something changed or is this just two spikes in a row that are next to

**00:49:34** each other?

**00:49:35** Like it's not easy to know the answer to that, especially when like as we have discovered

**00:49:39** tracking down spikes is just totally pointless.

**00:49:42** Like unless it's very obvious, you're never going to know why there were more sales on

**00:49:45** one day than another.

**00:49:47** The big idea in this book is making these process control charts that are trying to

**00:49:53** tell you when do you need to worry or on the flip side, if you've done something in your

**00:50:00** business, how do you know that it actually had an effect?

**00:50:05** So for example, if you start running an advertising campaign, it's like, oh, if you run Facebook

**00:50:10** ads, Facebook's probably going to always lean on the side of like, hey, these ads were great.

**00:50:14** You should spend more.

**00:50:15** How do you know independently how effective was that actually so that you're just not

**00:50:21** relying on that other entity?

**00:50:23** Or if you're doing advertising, but it's more along the lines of something like brand recognition,

**00:50:28** how do you know if it's actually effective?

**00:50:31** And so tunnel J Wheeler with these process control charts has a kind of cute way of answering

**00:50:38** two of these questions.

**00:50:40** And so one of the things is it's like, okay, so you put your data on a chart, you know,

**00:50:45** you take sales every day, you measure it and you calculate the average value and you draw

**00:50:52** that line on the chart.

**00:50:54** So it's like, oh, average daily sales is 10 units.

**00:50:59** And a really quick way to know if something has changed is if you have six days in a row

**00:51:08** that are above or below that average line.

**00:51:13** There's a bunch of math behind this that doesn't matter, but it works out to if you have six

**00:51:17** days in a row that are above or below the line, the chances of that happening just randomly

**00:51:23** are less than 1% or maybe they're about 1%.

**00:51:27** Six is like the magic number here.

**00:51:29** Yeah.

**00:51:30** So this is where, again, if you're, if I'm trying to think of something like, when should

**00:51:34** I bring up something to Mike, right?

**00:51:37** If I see we have six days in a row where sales are below average, I can be 99% certain that

**00:51:46** this isn't just an unlucky run.

**00:51:49** Something has happened.

**00:51:51** And so that's an indication of like, is there something broken on the website so that sales

**00:51:55** aren't going through?

**00:51:56** Is there something weird that's occurred that has happened?

**00:52:00** It's an indication to start looking into things.

**00:52:04** And conversely, if you have six days in a row where sales go up, it means something

**00:52:11** has probably changed.

**00:52:13** So we have an example for this, which is that we've just integrated Cotton Bureau into both

**00:52:17** of our YouTube channels.

**00:52:19** So if someone goes to watch one of our YouTube videos, either on my channel or on the Cortex

**00:52:24** channel below that, sometimes YouTube will show you people, Hey, there's notebooks for

**00:52:30** sale or there's a pen for sale.

**00:52:32** You might want to check it out.

**00:52:33** And so we just did this like four days ago, but I could see already like, Oh, average

**00:52:39** sales are up for all of those four days.

**00:52:42** It's not six days, but at this point, I'm very certain like we're going to have two

**00:52:47** more days of above average sales.

**00:52:49** And then that's an indication of like something happened that was a material change with a

**00:52:55** 99% certainty that this is not just random.

**00:53:00** You integrating this thing has had a material effect on the sales.

**00:53:04** And this is how you actually know that in some sense is a very simple tool, like just

**00:53:10** graph your data and put a little average line on it.

**00:53:14** And you're looking for runs of six above and below.

**00:53:17** But even for someone like me who has a really math background, the way that I had originally

**00:53:22** set up our spreadsheets to try to attract stuff, didn't have that as a like visually

**00:53:28** obvious part of what was going on.

**00:53:30** I was analyzing a bunch of statistics about the data to try to manage our inventory, but

**00:53:35** I didn't just have a line of like sales and the average line that goes along here.

**00:53:41** And there's a second part, which is sometimes something happens that's so extreme, you

**00:53:47** can know right away on that day for sure something has happened.

**00:53:55** And in the book, he tells you how to calculate this, but there's a line that you can draw

**00:53:58** for people who know about standard deviation.

**00:54:01** It's three times the standard deviation.

**00:54:03** You can draw a line that's significantly above your average.

**00:54:07** And if on any particular day, the sales like cross that line or like errors per hundred

**00:54:14** units cross that line, you know something happened that day.

**00:54:20** You don't need to wait to try to figure out what else it is.

**00:54:23** This again is like a really interesting thing from our perspective, because when I first

**00:54:28** started doing this kind of stuff and I didn't have this tool available from my perspective,

**00:54:34** I know you think about this slightly differently, but from my perspective, I caused a mistake

**00:54:40** in our business because we had had an article written about the sidekick in Inc magazine.

**00:54:49** And that article caused a huge spike in sales and on a process control chart, this thing

**00:54:58** showed up as like six times higher than the standard deviation line.

**00:55:03** Like it's just enormous.

**00:55:04** Like, you know, immediately like something happens that is way out of the ordinary.

**00:55:10** But because of the way that I was analyzing the data, that spike was just getting turned

**00:55:15** into like, what are our average daily sales numbers?

**00:55:19** And so I was doing this thing of like very badly overestimating our average daily sales

**00:55:24** numbers because I was less aware of this spike than I should have been because of the way

**00:55:29** that I was looking at the data.

**00:55:31** And so we placed an order that was too high in terms of inventory.

**00:55:37** Now it didn't matter.

**00:55:39** Sidekick sales were strong and like it wasn't really a problem, but it was one of these

**00:55:43** cases of, oh, from my perspective as like head of logistics, I caused us to be temporarily

**00:55:51** overstocked because of the way that I was looking at the data.

**00:55:56** And I wasn't using this like very straightforward tool of a process control chart because it

**00:56:01** was just not something I had come across in the way that like I was trying to think

**00:56:05** about how to analyze this particular kind of data.

**00:56:08** I feel like this little book has been worth its weight in gold for just putting some charts

**00:56:14** on my spreadsheet to be able to look at the data.

**00:56:18** And I think it's basically two thumbs up recommend book for anyone who has a small business.

**00:56:24** Well, again, because like you can hear someone talk about a thing.

**00:56:27** It's different to see someone work through an example.

**00:56:30** And also whenever you read a book, it's different to go through the details of how you're analyzing

**00:56:36** something.

**00:56:37** There are like actual examples in the book too, right?

**00:56:38** Which is like, yeah, you need that.

**00:56:40** Oh, and the other thing that I really just liked as a point, which is also just kind

**00:56:43** of lines up to my overall philosophy of things of like trend lines matter more than goals.

**00:56:49** He also just makes the good point that a lot of businesses will like set goals that are

**00:56:55** basically based on nothing.

**00:56:58** And it causes a bunch of problems because your data is noisy or like the world is uncertain

**00:57:04** enough that it's just not possible to ever hit that goal.

**00:57:08** And so you just get end up in a weird position as a business where it's like, this is a goal

**00:57:12** that we want to try to achieve, right?

**00:57:13** We only want one error in a thousand.

**00:57:15** And it's like, there's no technology on earth that can do that, but you don't know that

**00:57:18** at the start.

**00:57:19** So I really like this as a model for what you're trying to do is increase the frequency

**00:57:26** of like six day runs where you're very certain that something has happened.

**00:57:30** So I think all of this translates to our conversations.

**00:57:34** Like when I am talking to you about something, it is almost always because either on these

**00:57:43** process control charts or in some of the other methods that I'm doing, a thing has crossed

**00:57:49** what we call statistical significance to be able to say, even with noisy data where

**00:57:54** random things happen all of the time, we can be very certain that this event is not random

**00:58:02** that we can point to something that has caused this to happen, or we need to figure out what

**00:58:08** is the thing that has caused this to happen.

**00:58:10** So that's like when I bring stuff up to you.

**00:58:12** So anyway, that's my mini book review of understanding variation, the key to managing chaos by Donald

**00:58:17** Jay Wheeler.

**00:58:18** I'm very happy you read it.

**00:58:20** I'm very happy I didn't have to read it and that we just got to talk about it.

**00:58:24** It was genuinely a delight to read.

**01:00:23** I want to talk about sub-stack.

**01:00:24** Oh, okay.

**01:00:25** Do you want to talk about this?

**01:00:27** I do.

**01:00:28** Recently you moved your mailing list to a sub-stack mailing list.

**01:00:33** Right.

**01:00:34** I am really intrigued about what your business decision is for doing this.

**01:00:43** And also I think maybe I would like to still understand like in 2023 how important is an

**01:00:51** email newsletter for you as a YouTuber.

**01:00:55** Because like sub-stack, right, most people know sub-stack or I know sub-stack because

**01:01:00** it is a platform for writers, right?

**01:01:03** It is a platform for journalists, storytellers to be able to create a monetized newsletter

**01:01:11** system that they can send out.

**01:01:14** And then there's also just like a whole ecosystem based around sub-stack.

**01:01:19** I guess kind of like a patron, like a company Patreon is what I'm talking about.

**01:01:24** Not like an individual in the sense of like Patreon is a thing that you have and you are

**01:01:29** like a Patreon creator, right?

**01:01:31** And you have your Patreon.

**01:01:32** But also Patreon is a platform that offers different tools and also like a front end

**01:01:40** to a user.

**01:01:41** So differently would be say what you were using before, MailChimp, right?

**01:01:48** MailChimp is just a mechanism.

**01:01:50** There's no like I'm going to the MailChimp website and browsing different things to subscribe

**01:01:55** to.

**01:01:56** So like sub-stack has its own kind of like way of doing things.

**01:02:00** And I'm kind of intrigued to understand why you've moved to this and why you even still

**01:02:07** continue to be so focused on having a newsletter as a YouTuber primarily where you realistically

**01:02:15** just want people to subscribe to the YouTube channel.

**01:02:17** Yeah, this is a little tricky to talk about because sub-stack is quite hard to categorize.

**01:02:25** I feel like sub-stack as a company and as a business and as a product, they're successfully

**01:02:34** walking a bunch of tight ropes where they sort of exist in between a whole bunch of

**01:02:40** areas.

**01:02:41** And I first became aware of them existing because of I was inspired by you to use RSS

**01:02:49** more a couple of years ago.

**01:02:51** Maybe it was for last year's theme.

**01:02:52** I can't quite remember anymore.

**01:02:54** And I was like, I want to try to make my internet more RSS based.

**01:02:59** And if you do that, it's like, okay, right.

**01:03:01** This is where I'm asking.

**01:03:02** Hey, can you please recommend me blogs, right?

**01:03:05** Generic blogs I'm looking for.

**01:03:08** And if you're doing that kind of thing, you're going to stumble across sub-stack basically

**01:03:11** immediately.

**01:03:12** I want to say sub-stack is like single-handedly responsible for a kind of blogging renaissance

**01:03:18** in the past few years is the way it seems to me.

**01:03:21** This is the issue here where it's like, I agree, but also don't.

**01:03:27** So yeah, sub-stack has a business need for them to be sub-stacks, not blogs.

**01:03:38** So yeah, sub-stack, the company doesn't want them to be thought of as blogs.

**01:03:43** I assume they want them to be sub-stacks.

**01:03:45** Like that's the name.

**01:03:46** So yeah, I'm being cement.

**01:03:49** I'm being like, no, no, no.

**01:03:51** But the very reason like the semantics come up is what I was saying at the top.

**01:03:55** It's like sub-stack just exists in an interesting place that makes it a little tricky to talk

**01:03:59** about. And when I say it's like single-handedly responsible for a kind of blogging renaissance,

**01:04:05** what I mean is there's motivation again for people to write on the internet, particularly

**01:04:12** to write long form things.

**01:04:13** And that's great that that exists.

**01:04:16** For a long time, it was a kind of desert of writing on the internet.

**01:04:22** It just if you wanted to make a living at it, it was extremely difficult to do.

**01:04:27** Whereas I have a business making YouTube videos because YouTube made it really easy to make

**01:04:32** a living as a successful video creator.

**01:04:35** It's like they've got this whole platform.

**01:04:36** They can do a whole thing.

**01:04:38** If you wanted to just be a writer, it was really hard.

**01:04:42** And I think a lot of people who were talented writers for a number of years were putting

**01:04:48** their effort into other things like video because that was where you could actually

**01:04:53** make a living at things, even if you didn't primarily want to do video.

**01:04:56** So for anyone who's not familiar, I would just say like sub-stack, someone can have a

**01:05:01** website that basically looks like a blog.

**01:05:05** They can have a bunch of articles and sub-stack provides a really easy way for that

**01:05:11** author to set up a paywall behind which they can put some or all of their content.

**01:05:17** That's what sub-stack does.

**01:05:19** And they just make it dead easy to set up and they're very hands off.

**01:05:25** So it's not fair to say that sub-stack is like a platform, right?

**01:05:32** You don't go to sub-stack.com and see like, what are the hot articles now?

**01:05:37** Sub-stack allows the individual authors to really have websites that just are their own

**01:05:44** thing, that it is not immediately obvious that it's a sub-stack thing.

**01:05:48** Like if you know what the look is, you can recognize them.

**01:05:50** I mean, I don't know, like you use it, right?

**01:05:53** And so that's one thing, but like I, yeah, tell me.

**01:05:56** I don't, okay.

**01:05:57** So like, just like lay my cards on the table, right?

**01:06:01** Me here.

**01:06:02** So we work with, I actually think they're sponsoring this episode.

**01:06:05** We work with member for, which is a part of Patreon, but it's essentially like the

**01:06:10** plumbing for a membership system rather than there being a front end.

**01:06:14** And I prefer to, and Relay FM chooses to use them because then we own our front

**01:06:20** end, right?

**01:06:21** And like it's plumbing essentially.

**01:06:23** It's all of the things that we need to run more text comes that way rather than us

**01:06:27** doing literally Patreon, right?

**01:06:30** Which is the other side of the company and having it all be in Patreon system and

**01:06:34** kind of like a platform.

**01:06:36** Yeah.

**01:06:36** But that's like, that totally makes sense, right?

**01:06:38** Like I think any kind of company should, again, they're, they're sponsored this

**01:06:41** episode. So listeners, of course, you're required to take what I say with a grade

**01:06:44** of salt down, but I think any company should run their own system as much as

**01:06:50** they can with something like memberful, as opposed to running a sub-stack.

**01:06:54** Like a sub-stack is much more for an individual.

**01:06:57** Like that's what about gray industries is a company.

**01:07:00** Yeah.

**01:07:00** Gray industries is a company, but it's functionally just like a micro company,

**01:07:05** right?

**01:07:05** It's, it's not, Relay is a thing, right?

**01:07:08** Like there's lots of people doing their own stuff.

**01:07:11** It's, it's very different from basically.

**01:07:13** We needed like mechanisms to like build into our publishing system, right?

**01:07:19** To, to make it work, which memberful providers, but any, but my point more is

**01:07:23** just like, I would never go into a situation like this with a company like

**01:07:30** sub-stack and assume what you have said, which is like, they are hands off.

**01:07:34** It doesn't matter to them.

**01:07:35** Like it's only until it does sub-stack have an app, which I think they would

**01:07:40** prefer people to use than the RSS reader.

**01:07:43** Oh yeah.

**01:07:43** Yeah.

**01:07:44** Yeah.

**01:07:44** This conversation is not meant to be like a, the values of sub-stack as a company.

**01:07:48** I'm more interested in what you're doing, but it's just, it is an intriguing thing

**01:07:51** to me of like, you've moved away from MailChimp, which was just like pure

**01:07:57** backend to a company.

**01:07:59** Yeah.

**01:07:59** MailChimp is pure plumbing stuff.

**01:08:01** Yeah.

**01:08:01** A company that is offering like a whole experience, which is a really nice

**01:08:06** experience, especially as like a user, right?

**01:08:09** Like I prefer the way that everything looks for you from the emails and stuff.

**01:08:14** Now that they're sub-stack emails, rather than the MailChimp emails you're using

**01:08:17** before, but like I wouldn't necessarily assume that they're always going to want

**01:08:21** to be hands off.

**01:08:22** Yeah.

**01:08:22** Of course.

**01:08:23** Like companies can change over time.

**01:08:25** I think that they've structurally built themselves into a little bit of a corner

**01:08:29** the way they run things on the backend, but that sort of doesn't really matter

**01:08:32** for this, for this conversation.

**01:08:33** So like, again, let's like, let's back up for a minute.

**01:08:36** Right.

**01:08:37** So how did, how did this,

**01:08:37** Yeah, we got, we got a wire.

**01:08:39** This isn't even the point of this conversation.

**01:08:41** Yeah.

**01:08:41** Well, I also think this is funny because people might pick up that when I first

**01:08:46** started doing this, you were, I think it's fair to say you were kind of trying

**01:08:50** to talk me out of this, you're a bit like, I don't know if this is a good idea.

**01:08:53** Well, my initial thing was I was worried you were going to break something.

**01:08:56** That was my concern.

**01:08:58** That was more what I was focused on.

**01:09:00** I think sub stack is a really interesting idea for you specifically.

**01:09:05** But with caveats, my main caveat initially was like, I was worried that if you just

**01:09:11** did the importer that something horrific was going to happen, it just, it set off

**01:09:16** an alarm bell to me when you were just like, there's some hands off.

**01:09:18** So I was like, that's not a selling point.

**01:09:20** Like, because it's only until they aren't.

**01:09:23** Yes, of course, of course.

**01:09:24** Yeah.

**01:09:24** And Mike is entirely right.

**01:09:25** Like I'm, we'll get to it, but I'm, I'm using this in a way that they clearly

**01:09:29** don't intended to be used, which is always a risk.

**01:09:31** Yes.

**01:09:31** Yeah.

**01:09:32** You're also doing some strange stuff.

**01:09:33** Yeah.

**01:09:33** I could get a call from Mr.

**01:09:35** Substack any day, say, get off our platform.

**01:09:37** Right.

**01:09:38** Like that's very possible.

**01:09:39** Stop linking to Patreon.

**01:09:40** One of our key competitors.

**01:09:43** We want you to do it here, not there.

**01:09:44** So this is like, how did I come around to this?

**01:09:47** So there's two directions that this came from one, I became aware of like,

**01:09:51** oh, there's this interesting thing that a lot of long form writers are using.

**01:09:55** Yeah.

**01:09:55** And I was looking to try to read more blogs.

**01:09:58** And so I came across these things.

**01:10:00** And as always as a user at first, I'm like, Oh, some of these

**01:10:03** people are paywalling stuff.

**01:10:04** Like that's annoying.

**01:10:06** And then eventually some of them get me.

**01:10:07** It's like, Oh no, this writer is very good.

**01:10:09** Like I want to actually pay for their stuff and get the behind the scenes things.

**01:10:12** And so it's like, okay, now I'm in the system, right?

**01:10:14** Like I've crossed that threshold of paying for one of them.

**01:10:17** And now I'm seeing how this works.

**01:10:18** And then the gears start turning up like, Oh, this business model is the reason

**01:10:22** that there's more people writing because it's possible for people to make a living

**01:10:25** at this like, huh, that's interesting.

**01:10:27** So it was a sub-stack user.

**01:10:29** And then on the other side of it was basically every year at gray industries,

**01:10:35** at the end of the year, we just do a kind of review of the previous year and

**01:10:39** like, you know, what, what are things that we need to look at?

**01:10:41** What are things that we need to think about?

**01:10:43** And one of the things that had been at the very top of the list for several

**01:10:48** years in a row was, Oh my God, MailChimp is mind-blowingly expensive for nothing.

**01:10:56** MailChimp was costing us so much money with a huge email list.

**01:11:01** And this is a part of the problem of I'm like a weird customer because I just

**01:11:06** don't think very many content creators are using MailChimp in the way that I'm

**01:11:11** doing it as a kind of like YouTube fallback, right?

**01:11:14** I want a kind of messaging system that I can be fairly sure gets to people as

**01:11:20** opposed to YouTube notifications.

**01:11:22** Oh, and I guess also for this conversation, we need to disclaim again

**01:11:26** that MailChimp has been a sponsor.

**01:11:27** I don't know if much of a disclaimer needs to be like, company was too expensive

**01:11:31** and I left like, Oh, you might be in the pocket, a big MailChimp.

**01:11:36** Yeah, no, I know.

**01:11:38** Like here, like people MailChimp was costing me like more than a thousand

**01:11:43** dollars a month, it would be like at the end of the year, it'd be like, Oh, we

**01:11:47** spent like $14,000 this year on MailChimp to do what?

**01:11:52** Send 18 emails.

**01:11:55** It was like, Jesus Christ, right?

**01:11:57** This is brutal.

**01:11:59** When you say it like that, it's like how many emails are sent?

**01:12:02** Like, cause you know, I know like you have a very, very large email newsletter

**01:12:06** base to try and understand is probably one of the issues, but like the fact

**01:12:09** that there's so few emails, that's the issue, right?

**01:12:12** So here's what was really the brutal fact for me is that the median month, I was

**01:12:18** spending more than a thousand dollars just to let people know that an episode

**01:12:21** of Cortex went up.

**01:12:26** Sorry.

**01:12:28** I didn't even think about that.

**01:12:30** Right.

**01:12:31** Oh no.

**01:12:32** Yeah.

**01:12:33** I support the move to sub-stack.

**01:12:35** Right.

**01:12:36** So, but here's the thing.

**01:12:38** I, I paid that as like YouTube insurance in a way, right?

**01:12:42** Cause I'm very sensitive to this thing of on the internet, if your business exists

**01:12:48** on somebody else's platform, you can get shut down at any moment.

**01:12:51** Yeah.

**01:12:51** And so I'm like, look, this is a ridiculous business expense.

**01:12:55** Thank you to all of my patrons for like allowing that to happen.

**01:12:59** But I just viewed it as a kind of like necessary insurance.

**01:13:02** Yeah.

**01:13:03** Yeah.

**01:13:04** Boy, I'll tell you like that day that I woke up and I couldn't access my YouTube

**01:13:07** account for weird reasons that took a while to sort out boy, was I thrilled to

**01:13:13** have an email list that day.

**01:13:15** It's like, okay, great.

**01:13:15** Like I'm not totally screwed.

**01:13:17** I have a way out of this, but nonetheless, it just constantly came up as like.

**01:13:23** This is a ridiculous business expense.

**01:13:25** What can we do about it?

**01:13:26** And the answer for years was like, there just really isn't anything

**01:13:30** that we can do about it.

**01:13:31** Sending out lots of emails is very expensive for other companies to do it.

**01:13:35** That kind of cost would make sense for almost any other business that was

**01:13:40** running an email list of that size, but it just doesn't make sense for us

**01:13:43** because we weren't like using it to promote, like we've got new products every

**01:13:47** month, like there was, there was none of that.

**01:13:49** So it was just a pure loss.

**01:13:51** And so these two things existed.

**01:13:54** And one day I realized, Oh, sub stack.

**01:13:58** I think of it as like a blog front end, but their business proposition is really

**01:14:05** that they're an email list and they kind of treat the website part of it as like

**01:14:11** incidental, like it's almost irrelevant, which I still think is very weird

**01:14:15** business messaging, but that's their perspective on it is like, Oh, we at

**01:14:19** sub stack, we're actually a paid newsletter service.

**01:14:23** That's what we do.

**01:14:25** And we just like happened to make websites because people would want like a website,

**01:14:29** but we're actually all about an email service.

**01:14:32** And so I started looking into that and I was like, Hey, I wonder how much sub

**01:14:35** stack charges for sending out an email.

**01:14:38** The answer was nothing.

**01:14:39** They charge nothing, right?

**01:14:40** It's free to send out these emails.

**01:14:42** And I was like, well, that is quite intriguing.

**01:14:46** So this is where Mike quite rightly got afraid because sub stack is not

**01:14:52** expecting a customer like me to show up and be like, Hey, I have a giant email

**01:14:58** list that I'd love to import.

**01:14:59** So I can just like use your offer of sending out free emails because from

**01:15:04** sub-sacs perspective, anyone who would have an email list of my size on their

**01:15:09** website, again, is a different kind of customer, someone who would have built

**01:15:13** up that audience as a writer and had a bunch of people paying for their writing.

**01:15:17** And also like an email newsletter of your size, they would have some kind

**01:15:21** of chart, which maybe a book helped them decide if like, this is going to make us

**01:15:26** this amount of money, but that is not your reason for doing this.

**01:15:30** Like you were an abnormal customer for sub stack because you are not a writer who

**01:15:36** is writing paywall content.

**01:15:38** Like that's who they are creating their platform for.

**01:15:41** Like sub-stack is for writers.

**01:15:44** Like that's what it's for.

**01:15:45** And you're not one of those.

**01:15:46** Yeah.

**01:15:47** So we'll put an asterisk on that for a moment.

**01:15:49** So this is how it started.

**01:15:50** I was like, Oh, well, what could possibly go wrong?

**01:15:52** And then Mike was very concerned and quite right about like many things can go wrong.

**01:15:57** I just want to state for the record as well that you said you just wanted to

**01:16:00** use like the importer tool.

**01:16:02** I was like, that is a terrible idea.

**01:16:04** Like with the size of your newsletter list is not built for that.

**01:16:08** I'm sure like, I think it worked though.

**01:16:11** So maybe it was, but like, I would just say like, please just send an

**01:16:15** email to someone, anyone first.

**01:16:18** So of course I didn't send an email to anyone first, which I just charged right

**01:16:22** ahead and hashtag Mike was right because I was like, I'll just use the regular

**01:16:25** importer and it was like, no, you will not use the regular importer.

**01:16:29** They at least built it to like catch people like me and dumped me over into a

**01:16:35** special system to manually import it.

**01:16:37** So I was like, Oh, okay.

**01:16:38** Right.

**01:16:38** They gave me over to a human, but I was like, I'll just, I'll just see if it works.

**01:16:42** I'll just press this button and see if I can import like a hundred thousand emails.

**01:16:45** What could possibly go wrong?

**01:16:46** Yeah.

**01:16:46** Yeah.

**01:16:47** Yeah.

**01:16:48** But okay.

**01:16:48** So here's what my thinking about sub stack is for me, it exists as like a very

**01:16:57** interesting middle place between YouTube and Patreon.

**01:17:03** So when I think about YouTube, it's like YouTube is a huge platform, right?

**01:17:08** YouTube's main advantage is just reach, right?

**01:17:11** Like incredible reach.

**01:17:13** Like you can get nowhere else.

**01:17:15** It's totally allowed me to make a living as a creator, but Patreon is really what

**01:17:21** allows me to survive as a creator, but Patreon doesn't have reach, right?

**01:17:28** Patreon is, is for people who already know that you exist.

**01:17:33** So there's just like, there's no way for people to discover you at all.

**01:17:38** Substack is very similar to Patreon, but it has just a tiny bit of reach, which I

**01:17:45** think makes it quite interesting.

**01:17:48** So this is also the thing that you're talking about where it's like, okay, they

**01:17:51** have a whole system where if people find your stuff on sub stack, they can reshare

**01:17:56** it with their own audiences.

**01:17:58** People can like things and people can see what other people have liked.

**01:18:01** They do have on the main website, there are leaderboards.

**01:18:04** So you can see who are popular creators on sub stack.

**01:18:07** And they have the app at like, which they push people towards.

**01:18:10** They want people to download the app and then obviously it's an app that they

**01:18:13** control so they can like surface any content, make recommendations, you know,

**01:18:17** recommended articles, recommended sub stackers, all that kind of stuff.

**01:18:22** Yeah.

**01:18:22** So there's reach there.

**01:18:23** It's not huge, but it's more than something like Patreon, which

**01:18:28** basically has no reach at all.

**01:18:31** And what I also think is a really key feature here is that, again, as a

**01:18:37** user, you cannot be aware that multiple people are using sub stack, but when

**01:18:43** you decide to like sign up to become a paying member of someone sub stack.

**01:18:49** At that moment, they can give you discounted offers on other people on

**01:18:54** the platform you might be interested in.

**01:18:56** It's like, ah, that's very interesting, right?

**01:18:58** Like, oh, we, you know, if you're signing up for this person, we think

**01:19:01** you'd also like this person, you might already read this person and we can

**01:19:04** give you like a 50% discount if you want to sign up as a member for them.

**01:19:08** So this to me is where like, ah, it's quite interesting to have this thing that's in

**01:19:14** between, it doesn't have as much reach as YouTube right now.

**01:19:20** It doesn't have the kind of earning for Patreon, but it exists in the middle of

**01:19:27** these two, and so I was being very slow and very deliberate about trying to figure

**01:19:33** out how can I actually make this work for me?

**01:19:36** And I know again, this seems like it's nothing, but it ended up being just like

**01:19:41** a hugely complicated project that I had like calls with my assistant and we're

**01:19:47** working out details for, is there a way we can actually use the sub stack membership

**01:19:54** program that is consistent with the way things both work on YouTube and Patreon?

**01:20:00** So we can like have another system here because what I always wanted out of a

**01:20:06** giant email list like MailChimp was a kind of YouTube insurance, but years ago,

**01:20:12** I think you called it by like nuclear bunker or something.

**01:20:15** Like this is if there's a total disaster, right?

**01:20:17** This is where you retreat to, but it's not like a great option.

**01:20:21** And I think sub stack is the first thing I've ever seen come along in my career as

**01:20:28** a professional creator that seems like, oh, I think this actually kind of can be

**01:20:36** an actual additional platform that I could exist on.

**01:20:41** That's like a real backup, right?

**01:20:43** Not just a total emergency backup.

**01:20:45** So we spent a lot of time working it all out and figured out what I think is a pretty

**01:20:50** reasonable system of like, we simplified our rewards across all of the different

**01:20:56** places people can sign up to try to make things consistent with each other so that

**01:21:01** sub stack could fit in the middle here.

**01:21:04** And if people were sub stack users, they could sign up as members there instead of

**01:21:09** on YouTube or instead of on Patreon.

**01:21:12** And so far, like it seems to be working, but boy, it was this like slow and

**01:21:17** delicate and trying to see if things would work and like moving it just like one

**01:21:22** piece at a time and just like testing, testing, making sure nothing went wrong,

**01:21:27** testing, testing again, making sure nothing went wrong.

**01:21:30** I've only just started.

**01:21:31** I am very willing to bet that on the platform, I am a huge outlier in terms of

**01:21:37** there is nobody with as big of an email list who makes them the least amount of

**01:21:43** money versus anyone.

**01:21:44** Like I just have to be the biggest outlier there.

**01:21:47** This is one of the reasons why it's like, I hope Mr.

**01:21:49** Substack doesn't come along and say that he has a problem with me.

**01:21:52** You never want to be this person.

**01:21:54** Yeah, this is totally a problem, right?

**01:21:56** There's like an additional problem here, right?

**01:21:58** Which is also my members only content is video, right?

**01:22:04** The most expensive thing to host.

**01:22:07** So I don't even know what kind of calculations they've done behind the scenes

**01:22:10** of like, how many videos can they host versus like, how many members does someone

**01:22:14** need to have before they're like losing money on that person?

**01:22:17** Like what's happening here is a kind of business to business relationship.

**01:22:21** It's like, and you never want to be like the weird outlier who is

**01:22:26** potentially just causing problems, right?

**01:22:28** If you're a weird outlier and you're a huge source of money, that's different.

**01:22:32** Right?

**01:22:32** That's great.

**01:22:33** But if you're the weird outlier, you're like, Oh, I've got a hundred thousand

**01:22:36** people on my email list at like 0.0001% of them are paying members.

**01:22:43** It's like, that is not the kind of outlier that you want to be.

**01:22:46** But all of this is from my perspective, a risk worth taking because of just

**01:22:54** this feeling about sub stack as a platform of like, it is the first as a

**01:23:01** business viable alternative platform that I have seen really since YouTube

**01:23:07** that has some kind of reach to it.

**01:23:09** So I think that's high level.

**01:23:11** All of my thoughts about why did I try to make this move?

**01:23:16** Why have I put in a lot of work behind the scenes to try and make this happen?

**01:23:21** And why am I willing to risk being a weird outlier on this platform?

**01:23:28** Have subscribers noticed?

**01:23:31** So part of the reason I'm so cautious is when your business is basically in the

**01:23:35** entertainment world, right?

**01:23:36** You have to think about your audience.

**01:23:38** And I've said before, I often think of the audience as being like a bunch of

**01:23:42** concentric circles and a bunch of overlapping circles.

**01:23:45** There's different groups and you need to kind of be aware of that.

**01:23:48** And you have to really care about your most core audience, the people who most

**01:23:54** like what you do, the people who are most engaged with what you make.

**01:23:59** And I've always assumed like anyone who signed up to the email list is much

**01:24:05** more likely to be a kind of core audience member, someone who's really

**01:24:09** interested and who really cares.

**01:24:12** And so because of that, that sort of person is also much more likely to

**01:24:17** notice when things are different.

**01:24:19** So this is part of the reason why I was being so cautious.

**01:24:22** But I finally had to throw caution to the wins when I put up the Ken

**01:24:27** Chess with hexagons video.

**01:24:29** It's like, all right, this is going to be the first one that just properly goes

**01:24:34** out to the entire former MailChimp list that is now a sub stack list.

**01:24:39** And boy, was that a nervous day?

**01:24:42** I'm like, I'm going to see how this goes, right?

**01:24:44** There's probably going to be a lot of feedback.

**01:24:46** Like this is going to be a day of dealing with things.

**01:24:49** Well, I mean, it's email.

**01:24:50** So like the real worry that you have, I know it's sub stack, but so

**01:24:54** they should have worked this out.

**01:24:55** But what if all your emails just go to spam?

**01:24:57** Yep.

**01:24:57** That's, that's the other thing, right?

**01:24:59** This is the terrifying.

**01:25:00** Oh, on a hundred thousand people's email system.

**01:25:03** I'm now coming from a different address for like, absolutely breathtaking

**01:25:09** and totally shocking to me.

**01:25:12** One, all the emails went through as best I could tell.

**01:25:15** Two, I didn't get a single piece of feedback from anyone about this.

**01:25:21** And I was like, I can't believe this.

**01:25:23** How have I made what seems to be like such a monumental change?

**01:25:27** How have I spent so much time on this?

**01:25:29** I've been like, you know, working with two other people to like, make this happen,

**01:25:32** get everything all set.

**01:25:33** It's like, oh God, you know, people, you change anything.

**01:25:36** Like people always have comments on it.

**01:25:38** And I did this nothing.

**01:25:40** I couldn't believe it.

**01:25:41** It was, it was the most surprising part of the whole process.

**01:25:44** It's like, I was trying to think about it.

**01:25:45** I was like, did people not notice?

**01:25:48** Like, I just don't even know, but it's like, nothing seemed different about the email.

**01:25:52** It's like they went out.

**01:25:53** I could see the open rates.

**01:25:54** You know, it wasn't like no one was seeing it.

**01:25:56** It's like, no, people were opening up the emails.

**01:25:58** They were clicking links.

**01:25:59** Some people signed up as sub stack members.

**01:26:01** And it was like not a peep about what seemed to me like one of the most dramatic

**01:26:06** backend business changes I've made in years.

**01:26:10** So sometimes you can really get things wrong.

**01:26:12** But right at the same time, right?

**01:26:15** Well, I think it's one of those things you hear nothing and it's fine, even though it is strange.

**01:26:19** Well, I mean, we'll see long-term if this works out, but I'm just really intrigued in a way that I never have been before.

**01:26:28** And I think one of the things that's just a good sign about like, when is something

**01:26:33** interesting is I don't think I will do it, but I have caught myself wondering sometimes like, Oh, does it make sense

**01:26:45** again to maybe just write something?

**01:26:47** Like, is there something that you can just write that you don't have to turn into like an extremely well-scripted polished,

**01:26:54** ultimately going to be animated thing?

**01:26:57** Like, does there exist a future articles?

**01:27:02** And years ago on the show, I know we had some conversation about why I stopped writing articles and it was exactly what I said before of it just didn't

**01:27:13** make any sense as a thing to do.

**01:27:15** There was no way to monetize it.

**01:27:17** It does take effort to do.

**01:27:19** And it was like that effort was just 100% better spent on making videos.

**01:27:24** So I don't think I will do this, but it's just interesting to note where does your brain go?

**01:27:31** And it's nice to feel like, Oh, this is a possibility again.

**01:27:35** This could actually make sense as a thing to do now that there's real incentives to do that.

**01:27:42** But in the meantime, I'm just going to keep using sub-stack for as long as they will let me and putting up members' videos and just seeing

**01:27:51** how that goes as a kind of YouTube fallback slash email distribution place.
