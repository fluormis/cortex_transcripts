# Cortex - 109: State of the Apps 2021
**00:00:00** It is that time again, tradition rolls around. Believe it or not, we have hit that point in 2020

**00:00:06** when we do our back-to-back episodes of tradition, beginning with State of the Apps. Can you believe

**00:00:13** it? We're here already. I cannot. State of the Apps is the official beginning of the end of the

**00:00:19** year. Yeah. And I was completely shocked when we were talking about scheduling for the remainder of

**00:00:25** the year and you were like, oh, we've got to do State of the Apps soon. Like, no, we don't.

**00:00:28** It's the first half of 2020. It can't be time for State of the Apps. Nope. November. December.

**00:00:35** They're here. You know, it was kind of funny to prepare for this. I listened to last year's

**00:00:41** episode and there are just whole categories of applications we're not going to talk about.

**00:00:47** Yeah. Wiped out. Like the amount of time that we spent talking about like travel. Travel apps? Yes.

**00:00:55** Gone. I did the same thing. I listened to the last year's State of the Apps and it was funny to me how

**00:01:06** even in an episode that in theory is like really self-contained of like, oh, what applications do

**00:01:13** you use on your phone and computer to get work done? There were so many times I was like, oh,

**00:01:19** young, naive gray who doesn't know what's coming down the pipe. Right. Like that happened numerous

**00:01:26** times. Yeah. Like the travel apps category. And even today when I was going through some of the

**00:01:34** apps on my phone to make sure I have stuff for the lightning round and like, oh, what are some apps

**00:01:38** that might not immediately pop to mind? Like let me dig through all the folders and see what's there.

**00:01:42** I almost thought, oh, I should create a category of like apps that I deleted because I'll never

**00:01:48** need them again. And it's like Run P the app, which tells you when to go to the bathroom in a movie

**00:01:54** theater is like, oh, that's never getting installed on my phone again. Like goodbye Run P.

**00:02:02** Like we were comparing our air miles. Yes. Yes. We compared our air miles using flighty. Yes. Well,

**00:02:10** uh, well actually, I mean, I guess in theory we could compare air miles again for this year.

**00:02:15** It's just the numbers would be really small. Well, actually, you know what though, great.

**00:02:21** Mine are not as small as I would have thought. Okay. Which is kind of weird. So last year,

**00:02:28** so this is using an application called flighty, which otherwise we were not going to talk about

**00:02:32** today, but as an app that we both really liked, but it's for tracking flights, which is not a thing

**00:02:37** that neither me or gray are doing. That doesn't mean nobody's doing them. Of course, some people

**00:02:41** are still flying. Uh, so if you are looking for a flight tracker, you can go for it. So in 2019,

**00:02:47** I wrapped up 47,679 miles flown around the world in 2020. I did 16,985. Oh, well, okay. So what were

**00:02:59** your flights that you got in? Well, so I went to LA, which definitely helped, right? Of course.

**00:03:06** And then I had multiple trips to Romania. So we had to go back and forth from Romania a few times.

**00:03:14** And that ended up racking up some flights there. So it wasn't a lot, but I was surprised to see

**00:03:21** that it was like, I don't know, a third, just over a third. Right. Okay. Let me, uh, oh, all right. I

**00:03:28** forgot about one. Okay. So in 2019, my vastly less impressive number was 23,000 miles or my,

**00:03:36** my 0.9 times around the world that I was determined to keep under one, but I am quite

**00:03:41** shocked that my 2020 numbers were 0.4 times around the world at 11,000 miles. I forgot. I did one

**00:03:51** business trip to Germany in January. And then the one real trip that I did was I went out to Colorado,

**00:04:00** good old Denver, Colorado to the weed research lab. The weed place. Yes. And so I went there,

**00:04:06** I flew back, like that's added basically what all of the miles are. And then I arrived home on

**00:04:13** late February and went immediately into lockdown. Didn't expect we would actually talk about

**00:04:21** flighty. If you are traveling, flighty is a great app to track your flights, but don't fly. Hey,

**00:04:26** gray, I want to, I want to do a bet with you now. Cause now when it comes to November 2021,

**00:04:33** we're both going to listen back to this episode, right? Right. So 2021 flighty stats

**00:04:42** higher or lower than 2020. What do you think? I'm going to bet higher. Oh, bold. I'm going to

**00:04:50** bet higher. That's, that's my bet. Okay. I'm going to go, okay. I'm going to go with higher too,

**00:04:56** for one reason, which is if we are able to start taking long haul flights again,

**00:05:04** i.e. that we feel comfortable to do it, we have a pretty big first massive vacation planned

**00:05:12** that if we do it, we'll be going to Hawaii again. Oh yeah. Okay. Right. So that's going to, right.

**00:05:19** Yeah. We've decided like we were going to wait cause we went to Hawaii for our honeymoon and we

**00:05:24** were going to wait for our fifth anniversary to go back, but then, you know, having not been able to

**00:05:29** go anywhere for a long period of time and we'll continue to not be able to go anywhere for a long

**00:05:33** period of time, we decided that our first big vacation is going to be going to Hawaii again.

**00:05:39** Oh, I didn't know that. I think that's a good decision. Yeah. I think that's a really good

**00:05:43** decision that like we want to repeat our best vacation. I approve of this 100%. For me,

**00:05:50** Hawaii is a horrible nightmare lands that I never want to go to, but for every other person on earth,

**00:05:57** Hawaii never fails to disappoint. So like you, I think that's a, that's a really good call to not

**00:06:03** wait. Technically, Hawaii doesn't disappoint you either. Cause you know what you're going to get

**00:06:09** and you don't like it. It still feels disappointing. But yes. Yeah. If the world had been the way it

**00:06:16** was, I think it would be right to like save that special location, but that's a good, that's a good

**00:06:21** call to do. I'm really happy to hear that. I think that's a good decision. So that will be like,

**00:06:25** if that'll be our first major vacation, like genuinely we're hoping that we'll be able to

**00:06:30** take some kind of trips in Europe before a bigger jump as that, but we'll see. So I think if we,

**00:06:36** if we look at this as like our optimistic view going into 2021, then I would say that mine would

**00:06:42** be higher too, because we're looking to make a very long haul flight. Yeah. I feel like my

**00:06:50** calculation here is not exactly optimism, but it's regression toward the mean. And so I figured

**00:06:58** this year has got to be the lowest number of air miles I have flown. I mean, maybe since I moved

**00:07:06** to London, that might not be literally true, but it's very close. It's going to be one of the

**00:07:10** longest periods without you going home. Right. Oh yeah. For sure. Yeah. So that's, that's the

**00:07:15** only thing I'm trying to think of is maybe my first year of teaching. I might've gone home once

**00:07:26** and that would make it the least year. Just when you're trying to do like calculations,

**00:07:31** you've always got to figure out what's the base rate. And it's like the base rate of flying this

**00:07:35** year is, is the lowest it's been in a long time. So just like knowing nothing else, the smart bet is

**00:07:42** the motion of this number will go back to what the average is. And I do also think like if I'm

**00:07:48** going to fly at all, the probability of a long haul flight being in there would be extremely high.

**00:07:56** And so one trip to the West coast blows a trip to Colorado out of the water. So I think I'm betting

**00:08:02** on being higher. Right. I get it. Cause if you're going to take the risk, you're more likely to take

**00:08:07** the risk to see your mom and dad than you are to like go have a meeting in New York or whatever.

**00:08:13** Yes, exactly. Exactly. Right. Or just like business trips in Europe, I'm not going to do,

**00:08:18** but if I'm going to get on a plane, the question of is that plane going to America is almost

**00:08:24** certainly like 100% is the probability of like, if I'm getting on a plane, where is my destination?

**00:08:30** That's my thoughts about it. I'm really glad that you asked this because this does make me feel

**00:08:34** slightly more optimistic. And I hadn't quite thought about it in this way, but yeah, I feel,

**00:08:39** I feel very solid that the safe bet for both of us is more. The only way is up, baby. Yeah.

**00:08:45** The only way is up. This concludes the travel section of the state of the apps.

**00:08:51** The unexpected travel section. Oh, dear. All right. Before we get into the rest of the state of the

**00:08:56** apps, including explaining what state of the apps is in case you have no idea what we've been

**00:09:00** talking about up until this point, I want to give everybody a reminder about cortexmerch.com

**00:09:06** cortexmerch.com. The subtlety and subtle sweater are available still until December 1st.

**00:09:13** Thank you so much. If you've bought one, if you want to get one of the very tasteful,

**00:09:18** classy, embroidered t-shirts that we make, we're all sweaters. You can get them now in a selection

**00:09:25** of new colors. We have the original blue, a new black option, and a red or burgundy option for

**00:09:33** the t-shirt and sweater. These are available until December 1st, and then they'll be gone again for

**00:09:39** a while. So if you want to grab one, grab one. I put my order in for mine. I'm excited to get

**00:09:44** my colors in so it no longer looks like I wear the same sweater every day. Yes. And this reminder

**00:09:49** to the listeners, Mike is also gently reminding me, because I always forget until the last second

**00:09:54** of like, Oh God, I've got to put in order. Yep. I did mention to Gray earlier that I would not

**00:10:00** be doing what I did for him last year, which was to put them back on sale three weeks later,

**00:10:05** purely so he could buy them again. That is not going to happen for Gray nor anybody else. So if

**00:10:12** you want a subtlety, you can go and get them. But it is worth noting that cortexmerch.com,

**00:10:16** we do have a selection of products that are always in stock. These are our original lines.

**00:10:21** So it's the original logo to the original hoodie, which is a fantastic hoodie. So yeah,

**00:10:26** you can go and get those at any time. We have a small number of pins available as well. So

**00:10:30** that stuff's available at cortexmerch.com at any time. But if you want to get the subtlety or subtle

**00:10:35** sweater, you only have until the first of December to do it. Yeah. And the sweater is great. When I

**00:10:40** crank my, my office down to freezing levels of air conditioning, I'm often using one of the subtle

**00:10:45** sweaters to keep me, keep me alive in my frigid working temperatures. I love it. This is very

**00:10:51** interesting to me. Why do you bring the temperature down and then just put more clothes on?

**00:10:58** Mike, look, aren't you the one who was saying like, Oh, you need the bedroom cold. Cause that's

**00:11:03** what the duvet is for. It's the, it's the same philosophy, right? The, that's what the, that's

**00:11:09** what the subtle sweater is for. Okay. Working in freezing cold conditions. Look, if it means that

**00:11:15** more people will buy sweaters, then I won't endorse this thinking, but I'm still not completely on

**00:11:20** board with it. Yeah. So anyway, in my closet, I've got eight of the blue subtle sweaters,

**00:11:26** I think. And now I'm going to pick up some of the, some of the black and burgundy. So there's also

**00:11:30** a little bit of variety in my life. So this is our fourth year for state of the apps. This all

**00:11:37** started many years ago when you wrote a blog post and then we ended up turning into a regular feature

**00:11:45** on the podcast where we take a look at the applications that we use mostly to get our

**00:11:50** work done. We talk about what we like about them, what we don't like about them and how

**00:11:55** sometimes, and this year will definitely be one of those times, how trends in our working lives

**00:11:59** affect the tools that we use. Last year, we started a tradition of sharing our home screens

**00:12:06** at this time. Now that would have been when we would have shared our home screen, but we

**00:12:11** spoke about it recently with widgets and showed off our iPhone home screens in the concept of

**00:12:15** widgets. But I thought what we could do this time is show off our iPad home screens, which I think

**00:12:19** is more useful for this anyway, because there's typically more apps on show and we can't pollute

**00:12:25** them with widgets as we maybe would want. So shall we, who wants to go first? I think I should go

**00:12:33** first because here's the thing with iPad stuff is as you correctly last year pointed out,

**00:12:41** there's really only two ways to run an iPad. There's the boring way and there's the exciting way.

**00:12:48** You go the exciting way and I go the boring way. So I'm sending you a screenshot that I took this

**00:12:57** morning on my research iPad, which is the more interesting of the two iPads that's still super

**00:13:03** boring. What has happened to you this year? What do you mean? The background. Oh, no, I feel like

**00:13:11** this is still the same. Do you mean the same as what? I guess I don't know if I've shared the

**00:13:15** research iPad screens. I don't know. I often like to try to have something that's more interesting

**00:13:22** on the research iPad. It was like a winterscape last year. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know. Okay. I know

**00:13:29** exactly the wallpaper. I know what the situation was. Yes, that was also, I think that's because I

**00:13:33** was in a location as well where I was like, Oh, I want to feel all winter. Let me have a winter

**00:13:37** winter background. Were you on location for that episode? I think I must have been or I may have

**00:13:43** recently been, which is why I had the iPad wallpaper that way. I don't know. I don't know

**00:13:46** exactly. Yes. The wallpaper that Mike is seems to be completely shocked by is just one of the

**00:13:51** standard Apple wallpapers that they have for iPads, which just is some, some blue paint swirls with a

**00:13:58** little bit of, with a dash of orange. Is it space orange? Who knows? Uh, on the screen. And I don't

**00:14:06** know for the research iPad, which is the one that I do like actual real work on, I do like to have it

**00:14:12** be visually, obviously different from the other. And I don't know, research is, I mean, I say

**00:14:20** research iPad, but it is still creative work in some sense. So I feel like it's a thematically

**00:14:26** appropriate wallpaper. Yeah. Your, your reaction was way overblown. It was surprising. I expected

**00:14:33** to see either, I don't know, a really dark screen or a winter landscape again. So I'm going to share

**00:14:40** my iPad with you now. And then I think we should talk about our categories of apps and then maybe

**00:14:46** we can come back to seeing if there's anything on these that we still want to ask questions about.

**00:14:53** Okay. Show me what you got, Mike. All right. This should be very familiar. I don't think my iPad

**00:14:59** changes very much. Okay. I've got the mic iPads. You have your, uh, your wallpaper wallpaper,

**00:15:05** again, the one I really like there, the photo of a wallpaper with the leaves looks nice, looks

**00:15:11** less nice on the iPad, but that's mostly again, the iPad's fault for iPads. Don't let you

**00:15:17** make things look nice. Nope. It's not the wallpaper's fault. It's the way to make an iPad

**00:15:22** look nice is to do what you did, but I don't is well known. I like app icons on my home screens,

**00:15:28** you know? Yes. And, and without a doubt, the thing that I'm doing is completely

**00:15:32** kneecapping the functionality of the iPad for aesthetics. So yeah, yeah. Yours is vastly more

**00:15:38** functional. Boy, this is like, okay. So you have a ton of icons as normal. There is one that catches

**00:15:43** my eye immediately, which is you have YouTube studio on your home screen. Oh my God. Are we

**00:15:48** doing this again? Did this happen again? Last time you say you listened to the last episode. I did.

**00:15:54** Did you talk about YouTube studio? You said to me last year, YouTube studio. Why do you have that?

**00:16:00** And I said to you, as I said last time, great. I operate our fantastic YouTube channel from

**00:16:07** YouTube studio, which is the cortex YouTube channel where you may think as you're listening

**00:16:11** to the show, why would I want to subscribe to the cortex YouTube channel? Well, whilst we do upload

**00:16:16** the audio of the shows to the YouTube page, we also upload the wonderful cortex animated series

**00:16:22** by H and bootette, which you should definitely go and consume because those videos are absolutely

**00:16:27** fantastic. So you should go and watch those. So yes, you can try and maybe palm this off as good

**00:16:33** promotion for our YouTube channel. No, it was not intentional at all. But you did this exact same

**00:16:37** thing last time. I feel like my brain must be completely resistant to the YouTube studio there,

**00:16:44** because I guess whenever I see it, I think about, oh, Mike doesn't do those fun vlogs anymore. So

**00:16:50** why is there YouTube studio? That's just what pops into my head every single time. I just like how

**00:16:55** predictable you are. I guess it was like, again, it was not, you said, oh, that really sticks out to

**00:17:01** me. Why do you have YouTube studio there? Well, I mean, I mean, that shouldn't be surprising.

**00:17:05** Humans are deterministic systems and if presented with the same input, they're going to give you the

**00:17:09** same output. So that's not remotely surprising. So we'll do this again next year.

**00:17:14** This episode of Cortex is brought to you by FreshBooks. Look, as a self-employed individual,

**00:17:25** as a freelancer, time is the most important because your time is your money. Ultimately,

**00:17:31** that's how you go about making your living is using your time to do the work that you want to do.

**00:18:42** slash cortex and enter cortex in the how did you hear about us section. Our thanks to FreshBooks

**00:18:48** for their support of this show and Relay FM. All right, should we start jumping into some of

**00:18:52** our categories? Sure. So we typically break this down into two large sections being productivity

**00:18:59** applications and writing and research applications. And we also do a lightning round and we may touch

**00:19:04** on some other things there. And we mostly focus on these areas because these are the typical areas

**00:19:10** where we have some level of overlap in our work. So productivity obviously is a thing that we

**00:19:17** think can look at a lot. And one of the big changes in my productivity system this year

**00:19:23** is my move to OmniFocus. Yeah. So this, I'm curious for a little bit of a retrospective here,

**00:19:30** because I mean, again, like spoiler alert, I'm still using OmniFocus. Wow. No one is surprised

**00:19:36** by this piece of information. So like, I'm just curious what your experience has been with this

**00:19:42** and what you think of it as the relative noob to this app of the two of us. Yeah. I mean, I had

**00:19:50** used OmniFocus in the past, but I came back to it about six months ago. This is something that

**00:19:55** Mortexans already know if you subscribe to Mortex, I spoke about it when I switched back in June.

**00:20:02** And at the time, the reason that I made the switch was because I wanted to try something new out and

**00:20:09** OmniFocus had been recently updated and I liked the visuals of it. And our friend Federico have

**00:20:16** been working with his partner Sylvia on a selection of custom icons for OmniFocus,

**00:20:23** cool, respective icons. So you could like change the iconography inside of the application and all

**00:20:28** of that just seemed really nice to me. So I thought, all right, I'll give it, I'll give OmniFocus a go

**00:20:32** again. And I was also looking to rebuild kind of my organization system for tasks. And I figured if

**00:20:40** I was going to do it, I might as well do it in a new application, you know, like wrap all of these

**00:20:44** things up in one. Yeah. And ultimately, the system that I ended up with was having still two kind of

**00:20:51** buckets, but standardizing them more across my time tracking and my task management. So to kind

**00:21:00** of give that a little bit more context, I have like these large tasks that I do, and then sometimes

**00:21:05** we'll add tags to those tasks, right? Like that's typically what I'll do. So I'll have a project,

**00:21:11** and then I'll add a tag and the tags in my time tracking system are just the names of the shows

**00:21:16** that I do. Everything else is a project, right? So sponsors as a project, membership as a project,

**00:21:22** podcast recording as a project. And if a show is directly related to that project, I'll tag it with

**00:21:27** that. And that was what I thought I wanted to go with. This ended up being annoying to do in

**00:21:34** OmniFocus because it was too many taps to get anything done. So what I ended up doing was,

**00:21:40** because this was where OmniFocus actually came to help me a little bit here, where I realized

**00:21:46** I don't need projects and tags, I need perspectives and tags. So this is the great thing that OmniFocus

**00:21:52** does is basically allows you to create saved searches or filters with lots of parameters,

**00:21:58** and then you can name them and save them. And they look like basically big buckets that you can put

**00:22:04** tasks into. And then with the added benefit of allowing some tasks to appear in multiple

**00:22:09** perspectives, which I really like. So what I have now is everything has tags, everything's tags. So

**00:22:15** I'll have all of my kind of big projects are tags, all of my regular projects are tags, all of my

**00:22:21** shows are tags, right? And then I will just add multiple tags per item depending on what it is

**00:22:27** that I'm doing. And then if I want to drill down into just specific areas, I've created a selection

**00:22:33** of perspectives that filter out those tags and show me tasks. So for example, I have a

**00:22:40** Cortex perspective. And I have a Cortex plus Cortex brand perspective, because sometimes I want

**00:22:47** to see the tasks that are for the show and for our company, right? And so I can see them all in

**00:22:54** one place, which would have been tricky to do in other applications, I think. So OmniFocus has been

**00:23:00** really good for that. So I like the organization of it. I've always really loved the forecast view,

**00:23:07** I know that this isn't a thing that you use. But I've always really loved OmniFocus's forecast view.

**00:23:12** And I'm happy to have that back because it kind of works the way that I would like it to work.

**00:23:17** I vastly prefer the OmniFocus iOS apps to the macOS app visually and functionally.

**00:23:23** Yeah, I can understand that.

**00:23:25** Not a big fan of the OmniFocus Mac app. It honestly feels like a different application.

**00:23:29** The iOS and iPad app feel the same. But the Mac app feels like another company made it.

**00:23:36** It's really weird to me. So I don't use the Mac app very much. Mainly the Mac app is just

**00:23:43** I check things off or I add something if I've forgotten to add something before, you know,

**00:23:47** like something just pops into my head and I have to add it now. But most of this stuff is done on iOS.

**00:23:53** But I actually do not use the OmniFocus task entry UI on any of my platforms. So on the Mac,

**00:24:01** I use the quick entry function.

**00:24:03** Oh, good. Okay.

**00:24:05** Which you told me to do. And that's definitely the way to add tasks on the Mac.

**00:24:08** Going into the app and selecting new tasks. It's too many clicks for me to get something added.

**00:24:14** Yeah, it's quick entry or bust on the Mac for sure.

**00:24:17** And then I created a shortcut to do this on iOS. I basically created my own quick entry,

**00:24:24** which I really like that shortcut. It works really, really well for me.

**00:24:27** So all it does is it says, like, what's the name of the task? When is it due?

**00:24:32** What tags do you want to assign? And that's it. And it's really quick. And with the way that

**00:24:38** shortcuts works with this kinds of stuff now on my iPhone, it's nice and quick to do. And on my iPad,

**00:24:43** I can do it all just from spotlight and it never leaves the app that I'm in. So that really works

**00:24:50** for me. So I would say that I'm mostly happy with OmniFocus. But at the same time, Todoist has been

**00:24:59** getting really good. What does really good mean? Like what have they added? They've been adding

**00:25:04** lots of features. Their widgets are amazing. They've created a lot of really clever widgets.

**00:25:09** Like, for example, there's one widget that you can configure that you tap it,

**00:25:14** and it will open to the task entry with a bunch of preset things filled in for you.

**00:25:20** Hmm. So like you could say like you had a widget that was for Cortex tasks or whatever,

**00:25:26** you could tap it and it will pre-fill projects and tags and all that kind of stuff all pre-filled.

**00:25:31** They've also created their Kanban system now that's in the application. So being able to see

**00:25:38** your projects is in a Kanban view. So Todoist is doing a lot of things. So I don't know.

**00:25:45** I would be surprised if I get through all of 2021 without trying out Todoist again.

**00:25:52** But at the moment, I feel pretty comfortable with my OmniFocus usage.

**00:26:00** Yeah, it's interesting about adding a Kanban view because that is one thing I usually do

**00:26:05** it on the Mac app, but rearranging a bunch of projects is always a little bit. It's not that

**00:26:12** it's clunky on OmniFocus, but there's something about just seeing the list of things where it

**00:26:19** doesn't quite work mentally for me sometimes. And I'm trying to think about like, which of these

**00:26:23** projects am I focusing on? And it is the thing where sometimes I think like the writing app I

**00:26:28** talked about last year that I switched away from Scrivener has this feature where it's like, oh,

**00:26:32** you can have a list of things or you can see them as a bunch of cards and you can rearrange the

**00:26:37** cards. And when you're done rearranging the cards, the list will show the way that it's

**00:26:42** been rearranged. I imagine that's the kind of thing that Todoist is doing. You can have a list

**00:26:47** and then you can rearrange it in a Kanban system and then still see it back as a list.

**00:26:53** As dumb as it sounds, what's the difference between looking at a list versus looking at

**00:26:58** a bunch of squares with the same names as the things on the list? It's like, I don't know,

**00:27:02** it's just different in my brain. And that is one thing that I do wish sometimes with OmniFocus.

**00:27:07** I just like to rearrange these things in a different way. So I think that does sound like

**00:27:11** a pretty good feature for Todoist to add. I still use things for some large projects like

**00:27:17** posting cortex. It's still what I use things for. Right. And I'm never going to give you up.

**00:27:24** Ever. I'm never going to give it up. Never going to let it down. Never going to rhyme around.

**00:27:29** And then we're going to desert it. When expecting that way.

**00:27:37** No, no, that wasn't. I don't think I could have gotten the rest of the lyrics off the top of my

**00:27:41** head like that. So I could get it started. That's all I could do. Yeah. You know, for the things

**00:27:45** that I used you for, you know, like take your pills, call your mom, like they're just the types

**00:27:52** of things that there's such low level tasks and the way that I want to be alerted about them.

**00:27:59** Is so different to any other task in my life. That idea of tell me and they keep telling me until

**00:28:06** I mark it complete. Yeah. It's perfect. And the application is just nice and it's updated enough.

**00:28:13** And, you know, I'm never going to find something I think that's going to do what I want for me in

**00:28:18** that way better, because sometimes you get to a certain point of an application where you and the

**00:28:24** app. You are completely in sync with what's going on. So you have a thing you want to do.

**00:28:32** You find an app for it. And then as the app is updated over time, the way that you're doing that

**00:28:38** work just goes hand in hand with the way that the app is evolving. Right. So at a certain point,

**00:28:44** so many things have to happen for a competitor to want to move you away.

**00:28:48** It has to one completely match your current system. And then two, offer you something that

**00:28:54** you didn't know you wanted. And that's really difficult. And so application like due, which is

**00:29:00** in essence, so simple, but that can be the difficult thing of trying to move you away

**00:29:05** because there's something super simple. Its feature set is just pure, right? And it's not

**00:29:12** a complex task. So you don't really feel the need to want to move away. And that's where I am with

**00:29:17** you at this point. I just don't think anything's ever going to shake me for that for the tasks

**00:29:21** that I use that for. It's very simple stuff. Yeah. I know that totally makes sense. And that's

**00:29:25** the same split that I have, you know, again, still using OmniFocus for basically everything.

**00:29:31** Do is great for the harassment reminder stuff. I don't use things for a separate big project.

**00:29:38** Every once in a while, if I want to kind of like, I don't know, brainstorm a little bit about a

**00:29:44** project, I'll, I'll boot up things as like a clear piece of paper in a way, but I don't really use it

**00:29:49** as an, as an actual app. Again, I think maybe the thing that's different this year, as compared to

**00:29:54** last year is that with the redesign of reminders on iOS, that my default recommendation for people

**00:30:02** would be to use that. Like if I don't know anything about a person, I think I'd say like, oh,

**00:30:07** go with reminders, use that as the default app and you will or won't very quickly run into

**00:30:12** limitations. And then based on what you feel are the limitations of that, you can figure out what

**00:30:17** to do app would work best for you. But yeah, I think like for most people looking to try a

**00:30:23** task management kind of app, I would say like, just start with the inbuilt reminders. It's

**00:30:28** much better now and is probably a good solution for at least 50% of people.

**00:30:35** So when it comes to note taking, I feel like I gotta ask you first.

**00:30:41** No.

**00:30:43** And, and again, it's like, having gone through what we've been through over the last few months,

**00:30:47** I can't believe that note taking has been a thing that we've spoken about multiple times

**00:30:52** in state of the apps and you had your answers for it. But I still, I still didn't know

**00:30:59** your note taking secret.

**00:31:02** No, there was no note taking secret. This, this again is just human communication is hard.

**00:31:07** Yeah.

**00:31:08** And when I was listening to last year's episode, having gone through the T-Coy incident this year,

**00:31:14** and then having had our discussion about notes, what even are they? It was also clear a number

**00:31:22** of times in that conversation where it's like, Mike is not hearing what I'm intending to be

**00:31:29** saying with this sentence. And so it's just funny to listen to that and think.

**00:31:33** You know, they can't go the other way that you weren't hearing what I was saying either.

**00:31:38** You know, it's not just on.

**00:31:39** No, no, no, no, no, no. I don't mean that it's on you. What I mean is like,

**00:31:42** we'll get to it later, but in particular, when I'm talking about Ulysses in that, it's like,

**00:31:46** oh, I'm clearly just talking in my mind about the way that notes are weird for me,

**00:31:52** but none of this is being communicated to Mike.

**00:31:55** Right.

**00:31:55** Right. Like that, that's what I mean by that. Not like you're failing to understand.

**00:32:00** The conversation is actually almost completely absent the concept of notes as people think of

**00:32:07** them. But there were still times where I was like discussing this and I know now like, oh,

**00:32:13** I see where this got totally messed up. Okay. So the note, the note taking

**00:32:19** saga quest situation situation. Yeah. Oh, it's going well then.

**00:32:26** No, no. I just assumed that you would go first and then I could try to like plan this, plan this

**00:32:32** better, but okay. So I've been using obsidian, which I've mentioned on the show a few times.

**00:32:40** And again, I really love it. I really, really do. And I'll say again, I am, I am not in the

**00:32:49** business of giving app of the year awards. That's something, that's something you do.

**00:32:54** That's something the upgradeees do. Like I just, this is not a category that really exists for me,

**00:32:59** but if I was giving an app of the year award, 100% it would go to obsidian. No, no question about it.

**00:33:07** Like I think it's what are you laughing at there, Mike?

**00:33:11** I have no doubt that it is a good app. I know not only do you love it. A friend,

**00:33:17** David Spox loves it as well. But when I look at it, I can't conceive of it.

**00:33:27** Well, I mean this again is we're, we're brushing up another like human communication is hard and

**00:33:34** brains are different situation because again, this is an app that is based entirely on words

**00:33:39** and writing, like, like endless, just words and writing. This is the only thing that the interface

**00:33:44** even is is like, do you like words? Great. We got a lot of them over here at obsidian. Like that's

**00:33:50** all this is is just a bunch of words. There's a bigger question here, which is a bit like

**00:33:57** what is the note system that I have? I don't yet have a good notes system in the way that people

**00:34:08** mean this. Okay. Right. I can't say like, Oh, here's how I make my notes. But still the reason

**00:34:13** that I love obsidian is for all of the projects since the T-Coi incident, I've been using it to

**00:34:23** try and write notes on those topics. And obsidian again allows incredibly free form

**00:34:33** writing where again, in my head, I think it makes sense to think of it as just like

**00:34:38** the closest you can get digitally to sitting at a table with a bunch of index cards and just

**00:34:44** writing on those index cards in whatever order and rearranging them like the user interface

**00:34:49** is fantastic for allowing you to just rearrange a bunch of these cards and to make it trivially

**00:34:55** simple to make new cards and also to make little connections between the cards. I think many people

**00:35:01** who use the app get totally derailed by the connections and focus on that part of it too much,

**00:35:08** but the connections are still useful for being like, Oh yeah, this thing goes to here and that

**00:35:13** thing goes to there. So I still don't have a clear system for the notes, but one of the ways

**00:35:22** that obsidian has proved really useful to me is as the app which can help prime the pump of writing.

**00:35:33** And so, you know, often the hard part with writing is getting started with it. And so this is like one

**00:35:42** of the tricks that I use for myself is it's one of the reasons why I talk stuff out loud a lot

**00:35:47** is because it can be hard to sit down at a computer and just open up a script and be like,

**00:35:53** Okay, I'm going to work on this script. Well, where exactly? What am I going to, you can get

**00:35:59** derailed by these little details, but if you tell yourself, just start reading it out loud from the

**00:36:03** top within seconds, you're going to find things that you're like, Oh, this needs to be changed.

**00:36:07** This needs to be smoother, whatever. But in order to do that, you have to have a relatively

**00:36:12** coherent script to be able to read it out loud. It takes a while to get to the point where there's

**00:36:18** like readable paragraphs. So before that stage, obsidian is really useful because I can use it in

**00:36:26** the similar situation where I sit down and I go, I don't have to write a script. What I am going to

**00:36:32** do is I'm just going to add some information on this little pile of index cards that I have

**00:36:40** that's related to whatever this topic is. And so that is, that is extremely useful to me to be

**00:36:47** able to say like, okay, I'm working on project Rosalyn. Here's the five index cards that I have

**00:36:54** on it. Just open them up and add stuff to this or like there's a way in obsidian where you can mark

**00:37:02** little like to do boxes. And so sometimes I'll add like a little to do, which says, you know,

**00:37:08** find more information about this or like, here's this document that you need to read.

**00:37:13** So it's a useful way to start quote, like writing a project without the intimidation of I am working

**00:37:23** on the script. And then very frequently what happens is within an hour of doing this, I tend

**00:37:31** to naturally then transition into writing the actual script because it's a bit like, okay, I've

**00:37:35** been booting up all this information in my brain and there's some things that I want to start

**00:37:40** writing that are going to be the actual script. So this is why obsidian has proved tremendously

**00:37:47** useful to me, even without having yet settled on what are like the formal rules for how this is

**00:37:57** supposed to work within my system relating to notes. So that is why I absolutely love it. And

**00:38:03** it is also why in some sense, the note taking quest is still a failure. I haven't accomplished

**00:38:09** that part, but I'm still in a much more useful place than I was before.

**00:38:14** I think fundamentally, I still don't understand what you consider quote, a note to be.

**00:38:19** Okay. So I guess what I would say here is that the distinction for what goes in obsidian is they

**00:38:34** are much more purely factual statements. Right. Okay. But yeah, so this is what I

**00:38:42** need to understand. I think we're going back to atomic notes again, which is fine, but I still

**00:38:48** just want to get it. Right. So when I call something a note, right. So like I have a note

**00:38:55** called cortex follow up, right. And in that note goes links, thoughts, bullet points, lists,

**00:39:04** all kinds of stuff. Right. But it is related to anything to do with follow up for the show. And

**00:39:12** then when I sit down to start prepping the show and putting things into our Google doc,

**00:39:18** I refer to the cortex follow up note that I have in Apple notes. And that's kind of where I get all

**00:39:25** my information from. But it kind of sounds like that's not what a quote note is for you. Like it's

**00:39:36** something different. Yeah. So what you're saying, like the word I would use to describe that is I

**00:39:41** would say that's a list. Like that's a running list of things. But it can also be paragraphs of

**00:39:46** text though. Yeah. No, I, I understand that, but when I look at our show notes, right, which we

**00:39:51** call show notes, that, that in my brain is much more like, here's a list of things. Right. And

**00:39:58** like we may discuss some of these things we may not, but they're all like headers for jumping off

**00:40:04** points of conversation. Right. But my notes app also includes things that don't look like that,

**00:40:10** but I still consider them notes. So I might have like larger pieces of text, which are relating to

**00:40:16** a project that I'm working on. Like it's, it's quite different. Hmm. Yeah. So when I'm talking

**00:40:24** about notes in the context of writing a script, what I mean is, is really here are all of the

**00:40:35** factual building blocks out of which a piece of writing can be constructed on top of.

**00:40:42** Like that's, that's the distinction. Right. Okay. And you see though, it's still not there.

**00:40:48** What is the minimum amount of text that you would consider to be a quote, a note?

**00:40:57** I mean, a single sentence could be a note. Right. This again is why, okay. Why would you create

**00:41:04** a single note for just one piece of text? Why would it not go with something else?

**00:41:11** So the reason for that is because you don't know ahead of time, which index cards are going to

**00:41:17** have lots of stuff on them and which aren't. Sure. This also goes back to the whole concept of

**00:41:23** talking about writing in terms of outlines where it always seemed ridiculous to me like,

**00:41:26** Oh, you just outlined the project before you write it. It was like, yeah, great. Thanks. That helps me.

**00:41:31** Not at all. Because all I need to do is know the structure in advance of the thing that I'm

**00:41:36** trying to create, which is the hard part. And so it's, it's the same way with notes where

**00:41:41** I don't know in advance, which of these notes are going to end up being bigger and which are going

**00:41:48** to be smaller. And lots of them end up being just a single sentence or two, but that's just through

**00:41:54** pure happenstance. Your, every note that you create has the possibility to be more,

**00:42:00** but it's just this note just ends up being this one thing. So a note could be, for example,

**00:42:06** this statue or this treaty, but it turns out you only needed one thing on that. But you thought

**00:42:13** when you set it up, maybe there's more to this. Yes, exactly. So like, I'm just, I'm clicking

**00:42:17** through my obsidian thing right now. And it's like, I have a note, which is titled the Senate

**00:42:22** nuclear option. And then the entire piece of information on here is a procedural move to

**00:42:28** reduce the number of votes needed from a super majority to a simple majority, the end, right? And

**00:42:33** the re like the reason that never got expanded is because I realized very quickly, Oh God, this is

**00:42:40** awful and so boring and so complicated that I do not wish to put any more information about this,

**00:42:48** like in a script that I'm going to end up writing. It's like, if this thing gets mentioned,

**00:42:54** this is about the level of detail that I actually care to ever mention it. And in the final video

**00:43:01** that I did on this topic, I don't have, I never even mentioned this level of detail, which is

**00:43:06** my note on what the Senate nuclear option is. I just reference it in passing and move on, but

**00:43:14** I don't know in advance that I'm only going to want this one sentence, right? This could end up

**00:43:19** being like a multi-paragraph thing. So that's why they can end up being small. And it seems sort of

**00:43:25** ridiculous to have a bunch of things that are a single sentence, but again, this is where Obsidian

**00:43:29** is really good where, you know, like on a full screen iMac, I can open up the app and I can

**00:43:35** easily have 16 of these little index cards all open at the same time and see them all quite easily.

**00:43:43** And that is one of the really nice features of this. And it's why I keep saying it's like having

**00:43:48** a bunch of index cards. And so when I'm like priming the pump, I can open up Obsidian, have

**00:43:56** a bunch of these little notes around and very naturally feel like, let me expand on this one,

**00:44:03** or let me look into this one a bit more and start adding some information to it or not. And like,

**00:44:09** that's the way to like prime the pump for writing of getting started of like,

**00:44:14** oh, maybe this one does need me to investigate it a bit more, or, you know, maybe this one I can

**00:44:19** see I left a task for future me to fill in a detail about this. So I'm starting to get this more now.

**00:44:26** The difference between the two of us, it's not fundamental, it is organizational. So if I was

**00:44:34** doing what you were doing, right? If I was right doing a video script or whatever, I would have

**00:44:41** a note and a bunch of headers in that note. And I would add information to the headers.

**00:44:48** That's just how I would work. Previously, I've struggled to understand what you even

**00:44:54** kind of meant about recording the information. I feel like I can get that more now. And I can see

**00:44:59** that we will be recording typically similar types of information, we would just store them

**00:45:04** differently. Where like, it would be madness for me personally, to have so many quote notes

**00:45:10** related to one thing, where I would have one note, not one note, I would have a singular note

**00:45:19** where I would keep all of the information in it and would move it around.

**00:45:23** Yeah, you're totally right. And I think this is this also gets to the thing we were talking about

**00:45:29** last time with notes about this concept of oh, there's different apps for different people and

**00:45:34** a huge amount of what they're about is how they structure things. And so the way you're talking

**00:45:40** about it sounds to me much more like you are creating a thing that would be more like a

**00:45:46** traditional outline, but you're just growing it in a more organic way. And then that feels like,

**00:45:51** yes, if you're doing that, then Rome or Notion might be more the tools that you would want to

**00:45:56** use that they sort of in their interface are biased more in that direction than something

**00:46:02** like Obsidian is. Okay. What's that?

**00:46:06** Well, in theory, yeah, but they won't get out of my way.

**00:46:10** Yeah. I mean, forget that part of it, but like what you're talking about for this sort of thing,

**00:46:16** you could reproduce on a single piece of a four paper, like you're writing headings and subheadings.

**00:46:22** Yeah.

**00:46:22** Right. Whereas when I'm working on it, if someone gave me that a four paper, I'd immediately want

**00:46:28** to cut it up into lots of smaller segments and move it around and be like, I don't need this

**00:46:33** whole piece of paper. In fact, I don't want the restriction of the whole piece of paper. I want

**00:46:38** lots of little pieces of paper that are each going to contain smaller bits of information that I can

**00:46:44** move around or group together over here or group together over there.

**00:46:48** Which I think puts you weirdly more in this new school of quote content blocks than me.

**00:46:56** Yeah, for sure. For sure it does. And the other thing that's just different here,

**00:47:00** which again is a new addition to the workflow since the T-CoI incident,

**00:47:06** is the process of explicitly creating a bunch of these little notes as an intermediate step

**00:47:14** between the primary sources and the script. That's part of what's new here and why I think of this as

**00:47:21** priming the pump.

**00:47:22** Yeah. Because you are taking the information and putting it into your system

**00:47:25** rather than when you write the script trying to rely on remembering something from the original

**00:47:30** document.

**00:47:31** Yeah. Or like, yeah, like I used to have Evernote is open next to my writing app and it's like,

**00:47:35** okay, I'm just skimming through or I'm looking at the highlights or whatever. So that's why

**00:47:39** Obsidian is existing as this layer between primary source and scripts. And it's also why,

**00:47:47** like I don't have a system because I'm also treating it quite fluidly. Like I'm just,

**00:47:53** I'm not bothering with a lot of the heavy burdensome stuff about like, let me link every

**00:48:01** note to the exact primary source and put it in a taxonomy of higher. It's like, I don't

**00:48:06** need to do that. And also that's too heavy weight when I haven't really decided what the system is.

**00:48:14** So again, that's why this is just like a virtual stack of index cards that I'm rearranging and

**00:48:18** writing sentences on. And where are those sentences coming from? They're coming from me

**00:48:23** reading the primary sources and then immediately adding something to an index card. And that's

**00:48:29** also why the index cards have variable sizes because I don't know in advance which are going

**00:48:35** to be big ones and which are going to be small ones.

**00:48:37** Is the text only entered into Obsidian or do you put text in another way and organize it in Obsidian?

**00:48:44** I'm writing directly into Obsidian. Again, it's a Mac only app. I'm just having it open on my Mac

**00:48:48** and I'm entering the text in there directly. That's the way this happens.

**00:48:51** But how does that work with the quote research iPad?

**00:48:55** Yeah. Okay. So the...

**00:48:59** All right. So there is an additional app here, which is on my list, which is a,

**00:49:04** I feel like an oldie but goodie, which is One Writer, which is a Markdown app for iOS. And

**00:49:12** just by happenstance, the way One Writer happens to work with Dropbox and Markdown files

**00:49:20** lines up perfectly with Obsidian so that if I need to add something to a note that is in my

**00:49:29** Obsidian database, which really is just a bunch of Dropbox files that are all Markdown files,

**00:49:34** and I am on my iPad, I can use One Writer to add to any existing index card that's there.

**00:49:42** Right. That makes sense.

**00:49:43** I don't do that a lot, but every once in a while I do that. And it's nice to be able to have as an

**00:49:49** option. Yeah. I know I would really be adverse to a note taking tool, which is an idea tool

**00:49:56** sometimes as well as research tool that I could only access from one of my machines.

**00:50:01** Yeah. And again, it is the biggest frustration by far, but it shows like how much I like this app

**00:50:07** that I'm willing to put up with it. When I say my... So when I say research iPad, I do mean this

**00:50:15** in a slightly different sense, which is just that maybe like investigation iPad might be a better

**00:50:22** word for this, but I use that a lot for the more exploratory phase of looking into projects or just

**00:50:31** trying to find stuff. And so I'll often have like a Safari window on that research iPad, which has

**00:50:40** 40 tabs open that are related to some video project, for example. Sure. And I try really hard

**00:50:50** to keep all of that, like whenever I'm investigating something to explicitly take the research iPad,

**00:50:57** like find the Safari window that's related to this project and like expand from there.

**00:51:02** And then there's another phase, which is when I'm priming the pump, kind of like going through those

**00:51:09** tabs, adding stuff into obsidian and trying to like close them down. So you have like expansion

**00:51:16** and contraction. There is one thing, I don't think this is possible, but I would love to know if

**00:51:21** anybody has figured out a way that you can not have like iCloud tabs, but is there any way to

**00:51:28** force Safari to maintain state across different devices? Like I would always want Safari on my

**00:51:36** Mac to be the same tabs and things as Safari on my Mac. That is a world you're never, I don't

**00:51:42** kind of imagine you're ever going to get that sounds wild. I know you say that, but I have this

**00:51:47** feeling in the back of my head of like, surely this is accomplishable with JavaScript or something.

**00:51:53** Like there's a way in which if I just run a script or a shortcut before I open, can I like force

**00:52:02** sync Safari to always be the same? I don't know if I can, but I feel like if that's possible,

**00:52:08** if anyone can figure out a way to do it, I am willing to run a shortcut or a script before

**00:52:14** I launch Safari on any device. If it can force state across all devices. All right. If you're

**00:52:21** willing to do that, I'm sure there's a way to do it. Yeah. See now, now it feels like it might be

**00:52:27** tantalizing. Well, cause I thought you were just talking about some like mirrored syncing system,

**00:52:32** you know, where it automatically does it for you. I don't expect this is something Apple's

**00:52:37** ever going to do when Apple would be the one who would need to do it. But I just, I just wonder,

**00:52:41** it's like, there's got to be a way with JavaScript that I can read the state of all of the tabs and

**00:52:45** like save them into a bookmark folder and have that folder opened up on another device or whatever.

**00:52:49** Like there's got to be a way to do that. That seems more possible. But so yes, there we go.

**00:52:54** Notes, Obsidian. Love it. It's great. It's great for priming the pump. If anyone out there is

**00:53:02** a writer, I feel like this is a sort of like a, just a new tool to look for in your own workflow,

**00:53:11** which is, which is not that you're writing, but that you're pre-writing tool. Like maybe that's

**00:53:16** just a thing to keep an eye out for. And, and I feel like Obsidian is this kind of thing

**00:53:21** that I didn't know could exist in the workflow and has proved extremely helpful. So app of the year,

**00:53:27** even though I don't give app of the year, I still use Apple notes, as I mentioned for

**00:53:32** basically all of my note taking. Now, Mike, what do you mean by a note?

**00:53:36** I already told you, you can try and make this joke already, but I have already told you.

**00:53:42** And somebody asked recently, I think it was on Reddit, how I organize my notes,

**00:53:47** because like Apple notes has folders and stuff. I don't do this. So I don't really have any

**00:53:52** organization structured to my notes. They're just like, they're just sorted by modification date,

**00:53:58** which most of the time is all I need. Like I am typically only really adding and removing from

**00:54:04** about six or seven notes at a time. Like there's what I'm going into most. So most of the time,

**00:54:09** I open notes and what I want is within view. But other than that, I just search to get what I need.

**00:54:16** Can you give me a couple examples of what you mean by the six or seven? Like what,

**00:54:19** what, what are your most frequent notes that you're willing to share?

**00:54:22** So right at the, I'll give, I'll actually give you a rundown now. So I have Cortex follow-up,

**00:54:28** 2021 yearly theme, upgrade follow-up, connected follow-up, streaming gear research, MacBook Pro

**00:54:36** thoughts, upgrade is 2020, panatic follow-up. Like that's my list as it's going down, right?

**00:54:42** And so in here are notes I use every single week, which is all of those follow-up notes that that's

**00:54:49** basic. But for me, that just means like it is where all the links go, all the additional thoughts go,

**00:54:54** where I write out some basic ideas for topics for shows every week. Then there's also in there,

**00:55:00** some like projects, right? So like looking into different gear for streaming and the MacBook Pro

**00:55:05** one is a good example of like, if I have a new product that I'm taking notes on to talk about

**00:55:10** on a show, I'll just create a note for that product, throw all of my stuff in there about that product,

**00:55:15** and then we'll massage it and take it out to put into a show document somewhere.

**00:55:21** Okay. Right. So that's kind of the typical way of like, it's from the top down is the stuff that

**00:55:29** I'm using frequently or the stuff that is important for right now. But if I need something later,

**00:55:36** I'll just search for it because it's very easy for me to find what I'm looking for by search

**00:55:42** because I label things in a way that I need and or just be like, oh, I'm sure I made a note about

**00:55:51** X. I would just search for that thing and I'll find it. So I don't use folders or any kind of

**00:55:56** structure like that because for notes, for me, it's just not a thing that I need.

**00:56:01** Yeah. I mean, it doesn't sound like you have enough notes that it makes sense to start to

**00:56:05** subcategorize them. Well, I mean, I have like the best part of eight or nine hundred

**00:56:10** notes in my notes archive, but they're not all being used frequently enough,

**00:56:14** but they're all there in case I need them. Okay. The number is two orders of magnitude larger

**00:56:20** than I was expecting. Okay. But, but search does the job for you. Like I have notes going all the

**00:56:27** way back to 2015 in here. I have 11th of October, 2015 notes from lunch with gray.

**00:56:35** E-Myth revisited. He's in there. So you told me to read that back in October of 2015.

**00:56:45** Okay. All right. You know, it's all in there. So if I searched, you know, if I've ever wanted to be

**00:56:49** like, Oh, what was that book gray recommended? I would find it. Right. Okay. Continuing to use

**00:56:55** notion for a few things that I want to separate out. So everything cortex brand related

**00:57:02** goes into notion. Um, and there's a little more organization to it because that's what notion

**00:57:07** demands. Right. So everything is a little bit more organized there into like categories and

**00:57:13** in notes inside of those categories. And also for some like mechanical keyboard related stuff,

**00:57:18** I've started to use notion, but notion isn't the app that I want to use for this.

**00:57:23** Can I just ask, are you using it like a database? Is that the, for the keyboard stuff? Yeah. So it's

**00:57:28** just, you're using it as like a record of here's the a hundred keyboards that I own and the

**00:57:32** components that went into them. I have inventory in there now. And my ultimate thought is to try

**00:57:38** and have information related to the products saved inside of there. But I haven't really

**00:57:43** started to do that yet because notion just still just doesn't feel like what I'm looking for.

**00:57:48** The app that I want to use is an app called craft. Okay. I haven't heard of this. This is a new

**00:57:54** entrant on the scene. It's like all of these other things that you've seen and that it's new and it's

**00:58:01** got backlinks and it does stuff by content blocks and all that kind of stuff. Everybody's thinking

**00:58:08** about notes because I'm thinking about no, it's not, that's not the reason, but okay. But craft,

**00:58:14** it is the reason for iOS and Mac OS is actually a native application. Ah, okay. Which imagine if,

**00:58:22** imagine such a thing when it comes to notes in 2020. That is a big advantage right away. It's

**00:58:28** designed really nicely. It has collaboration. This is one of the applications that I was trying out

**00:58:34** in my real time collaboration quest, but it still didn't do the thing. No, it wouldn't be instant,

**00:58:40** but this has like split view and multi windows support and all that kind of stuff on the iPad.

**00:58:46** The only thing craft is missing for me right now is the ability to create a table. You cannot create

**00:58:53** tables in craft. I understand they are working on it. Once they add this feature, I'm, I'm most

**00:59:00** likely going to move my keyboard stuff over to craft. So I'm keeping my eye on it. It's a really

**00:59:06** nice looking application. It's quite promising. Um, and who knows? Like I might move more and more

**00:59:12** over to it. It's got some really nice features and it does stuff in a way that I think makes a lot

**00:59:16** of sense for how I work and it's nicely designed and it's got a lot of modern iPad and iOS features

**00:59:24** in it, which I think is really cool and rare for applications in this space. Honestly. Yeah. It

**00:59:30** looks, it looks really nice. Just looking at the screenshots of it, but they've got a lot of the

**00:59:33** features that people want these days, you know? So like it's got backlinking and all that kind of

**00:59:38** stuff. It's got collaboration, you know, you can share stuff on the web as well as just using it

**00:59:44** in the app. So there's a lot of cool stuff in there, but it's just, it's missing something,

**00:59:49** which is pretty important for me for the use that I want because, you know, I want to start

**00:59:55** this keyboard to kind of note taking thing with, I have two tables, a inventory and a

**01:00:02** outstanding products, like, you know, stuff I've bought, but hasn't arrived yet. Like that's where

**01:00:07** it's beginning. And then from there, I want to be able to be like, all right, so this is all the

**01:00:11** information I have about this keyboard and this type of key switch and all that kind of stuff. So,

**01:00:18** but yeah, so that's why I'm keeping my eye on. I hope that come 2020 Tuesday at the apps,

**01:00:22** I will have more to say on craft, but I've not really been able to give it the full-on test yet

**01:00:27** because I keep falling down a pretty early hurdle for me. Right. Okay. Yeah. That looks like one to

**01:00:33** keep an eye on. Yeah. It also gave me a slight heart attack when you say 2022 state of the apps,

**01:00:39** but then I remembered that. Yes. It's like, like cars, it's numbered for the year ahead,

**01:00:44** not the, not the year that we're currently in. Yeah. And that was your choosing, not mine.

**01:00:48** Yes. No, I know. Yes. Yes. I would much prefer to call this the 2020 state of the apps because

**01:00:53** that makes more sense to me. Yeah. No, but my whole, my whole reasoning is like, no, but you have to

**01:00:59** people then when they find it, they're going to think it's a year old. Right. And so you sort of

**01:01:03** sneak it in like, Oh, this is state of the apps for 2021. This is current. It's just got posted

**01:01:08** yesterday, guys. This episode is brought to you by hover. One of the longest running sponsors on

**01:02:50** Email the wheel. So last year, your answer was I'm not doing it.

**01:02:57** No, that wasn't it. No, it basically was great. Okay. Well, okay. Yes and no. The thing that I

**01:03:04** found charming listening to last year's episode was the part where I said, Oh, I'm going to,

**01:03:09** for next year, the 2020 that is passed now for next year, I've got some, some thoughts and some,

**01:03:16** some big plans for email. And there's a way that I'm going to be using email a lot more. And that

**01:03:21** was contingent on a couple of projects that would have involved a bunch of people and travel and

**01:03:28** none of that happened. So the number of times I've seriously opened my email app in the past

**01:03:35** year might be under a dozen. So email is a thing that I continue to do my absolute best to ignore.

**01:03:43** And I just use the default mail app and I have, I have nothing interesting to contribute on this

**01:03:48** topic. But that is not the world you live in. I was expecting you were going to be like,

**01:03:53** Oh, I'm on top of my email. Did I have a fever dream where you told me you were on top of your

**01:03:58** email then? Why did I think that was the case? I think it might've been a fever dream, or maybe

**01:04:04** one of the times this year I got down to inbox zero. I just dedicated a day to it. Who knows?

**01:04:10** Maybe you then said like, I got it. I'm on, I'm on it now. And then I just assumed that you were

**01:04:15** back any email. Yeah. Like this is my quarterly email review. My word, Gray. I'm still using Spark.

**01:04:26** Okay. It's going to take, you know, I was talking earlier about like how

**01:04:32** workflow shift of application. It's like a lot to get me away from Spark now because of the sharing.

**01:04:38** Right. The commenting on emails with team members thing. Yeah. The team, team sharing features,

**01:04:44** like robust team sharing features are now table stakes for me. And also for me to now want to

**01:04:51** move email application, I have to convince somebody else to move email app as well.

**01:04:56** Yes. Yes. Now it's a decision for the two of you, not just the one of you.

**01:05:02** I have to be able to make a real good case to suggest that me and Kerry move email apps. So

**01:05:11** I don't think that that's likely the only thing that I have my eye on and I have just one,

**01:05:18** one eye on it. And it's not, you know, it's just glancing is an app called Hey,

**01:05:22** Mm-hmm.

**01:05:24** Which is like a new take on email, which I kind of don't like. Um, I also don't like that. It's

**01:05:30** just their service and that's the only email that you can have in that service. So you either go

**01:05:35** all in or you don't. Right. Because I have one email app that has my personal email and my

**01:05:42** business email. And I have like two business email addresses and they all go into the one app,

**01:05:48** which is spark, but with Hey, all of those have to be either at Hey.com email addresses,

**01:05:54** or they're, they're enabling domain kind of email soon. So you could have like mic at relay.fm,

**01:06:00** right? I could have that in there, but it would be instead of a Google email address,

**01:06:05** it would be a Hey maintained email address. Apprehensive.

**01:06:11** Yeah. I think you have every right to be apprehensive over that. That that's, that's a

**01:06:15** problem because I'm very confident Gmail is going to exist forever. Right. Like I know Google have

**01:06:21** a pretty bad reputation of killing products, but I think there were three that are going to stick

**01:06:26** around Google search Gmail, YouTube. Yeah. I feel confident in those three. So yeah, I don't know.

**01:06:35** I don't know. I know people that have gone all in on Hey and they love it and they keep telling me

**01:06:41** how great it is and how it's changed their approach to email. But I just, I don't know.

**01:06:48** Yeah. The longevity worry is, is a very legitimate worry for something like email.

**01:06:54** And also just like a big disruption. This is a big disruption. Like you are going in and saying,

**01:07:02** I am moving my domain now. Yeah. And you've got to hope that goes well,

**01:07:08** because if email gets lost, it's gone. Right. Yeah. And I just, I just, yeah,

**01:07:14** it's going to take a lot for me to want to do that communication applications.

**01:07:19** There's Slack. There's just the Slack, right? Mike,

**01:07:23** Slack is, uh, it is Slack now and there's kind of no way they can get away from it. This is what they

**01:07:31** are. Slack, you know, it was supposed to be the cool thing that got rid of email. And do you know

**01:07:38** what? It did do that, but it just replaced it with Slack though. That's the problem. And

**01:07:43** so many years in it is a fantastic tool, but that fantastic tool has just filled the same hole.

**01:07:54** Yeah. Yeah. With, without a doubt, Slack, Slack feels like a giant lumbering blob of a business

**01:08:02** monster in a way that many of these tools do. And their cutesy sound effects can't cover that

**01:08:08** up anymore. It just doesn't work. And you know what? Like it's totally fine. Right. Like it's

**01:08:14** doing its job. It's the business communication tool. And that's perfectly fine. But this idea

**01:08:19** that we all had the Slack was going to save us from a thing we didn't like was just has not held

**01:08:26** out. And it's just, this is where the business communication happens. Like this communication,

**01:08:30** which is much easier to manage because instant messaging is better than email. Just fundamentally

**01:08:38** for the low barrier to entry and the speed at which communication can occur. It's all so much

**01:08:44** better than email, but you know, it's just the new way that we communicate in business settings

**01:08:52** is Slack or teams, right? You can just like find and replace here for Slack or teams, right? Like

**01:08:58** whichever one you're using, it's the same thing because they're by and large the same products.

**01:09:02** Yeah. Yeah. I mean, the thing years on for me that Slack has done is that yes, in some sense,

**01:09:08** it has replaced email, but the real value is the, the siloing for things, you know, this,

**01:09:16** that is always the problem with email of like email can be everything, right? It can be from anyone

**01:09:22** and you can have spam and all the rest of it. At least with Slack, as you say, when I go into

**01:09:28** the company, A, B, or C Slack, all I'm going to get is stuff related to what's happening inside

**01:09:34** of those companies. Yeah. And that's a, it's a huge advantage. And it is mind blowing to me.

**01:09:41** Like, how did I ever run my business in some ways before Slack? Like, I mean, I remember having on

**01:09:48** iOS, like I used to use those thread alert notifications all the time for design feedback

**01:09:56** and like working with people for like, Oh yes, here I'm basically having an instant

**01:10:01** message conversation about, you know, custom artwork that I'm having made in the form of an

**01:10:07** email thread. And it was like, that was awful. So like, yes, Slack, you know, it is, it is what it

**01:10:13** is. I'm very glad to have it. And it has siloed all of that work communication into one area where

**01:10:20** it can just exist. And it is all better, but it's also, it's also not fun because work isn't always

**01:10:28** fun. And that's fine. That's the way it is. Discord, baby. Let's all move to Discord.

**01:10:35** Discord will be fun. That's where the phone communications happen in. Yeah. Discord is for

**01:10:39** the cool kids. I am very aware of this. The fact that I really like Discord. I like it for a bunch

**01:10:43** of social things. And I'd have had this thought recently that if I was starting a new project,

**01:10:49** like a professional project, I would use Discord. Yeah. I feel the same way. I do feel the same way.

**01:10:54** It has a different set of tools. Some of the things are easier. Some of the things are harder,

**01:11:00** but I just, I really like the overall application. I like the way it works. I like how easy it is to

**01:11:06** jump from Discord to Discord. I like that I don't have to create a new login every time I want to

**01:11:11** join a new Discord or create one. I like how, I like the moderation tools that it has, not even

**01:11:18** just from a community management perspective, but like even a small group perspective, like that

**01:11:23** things can be managed quite easily. I love the bots and how many bots there are for Discord and

**01:11:28** how open that is and how you can have it do weird and wonderful things. I actually, you know,

**01:11:33** depending on your, your outlook, the fact that it doesn't have threaded messages can be a good thing

**01:11:38** or a bad thing. I don't really like Slack's threads, honestly. So I'm fine with that, but,

**01:11:43** you know, your mileage may vary. Discord is the new chat app, but honestly, that just might mean

**01:11:50** that in a year, I would hate it, but Discord is where I would go now. Yeah. Well, again, this is

**01:11:59** the thing with Slack is going to save us from all the emails. Like yes, yes. It doesn't save you

**01:12:04** from the work though. Right. Like the work still needs to happen. Maybe Discord saves us from Slack

**01:12:09** though, you know, and then, but that's, that's the feeling is like, I think when people say this,

**01:12:13** there's, there's sort of an implied, it'll save me from the work, right? And so you're like, oh,

**01:12:19** I'll use Discord. It's more fun and there'll be less work. It's like, you still have to get the

**01:12:23** same amount of things done. But, but I do think Discord has the advantage of having come along

**01:12:30** after Slack, making design decisions, seeing how Slack works. So yeah, there's, there's a lot of

**01:12:36** stuff that is hard to pin down, but Discord does feel smoother and less heavyweight in a lot of

**01:12:44** ways. And that's also the same reason that I feel like if I was starting from scratch today,

**01:12:50** I would probably do all of my company communications on a, on a Discord rather than on a Slack.

**01:12:56** I actually think over the next couple of years, there's going to be another boom in these tools

**01:13:03** for so many reasons. Like one, of course, there's a market for it now because of remote working,

**01:13:09** but two, because of the change in remote working, everyone's going to come up with their,

**01:13:15** we're better than Slack. And this is why tool. So this was a thing that was around a few years ago,

**01:13:21** because Slack was gaining prominence. So people were like, we can build a better Slack,

**01:13:25** but I don't think there was a lot of take up for it because everyone was like, we use Slack,

**01:13:28** like what's the problem? But now I think these tools are so important that one, more people are

**01:13:35** using them. So there'll be more new takes on it. And two is investment. Yeah, that's, that's a

**01:13:40** really good point. I think you're right. Yeah. That it's obviously, it takes a while for this

**01:13:44** stuff to get off the ground, but there's probably a non-trivial number of remote teams who are

**01:13:49** remotely working together on their replacement for Slack right now, for sure. Listening to this very

**01:13:55** podcast in the background, right? Like 100%. That's the thing that's happening.

**01:14:00** It is 2020. So I've added a new communication app to this list. Zoom.

**01:14:08** I mean, I've used Zoom for years. Have you? But just not to the level that I use it now.

**01:14:17** Can you explain something to me? Like I do not understand really why Zoom just completely

**01:14:25** exploded this year. And it feels like, guys, we've had these tools all along and I have just,

**01:14:32** I've had this real resistance to using Zoom and get into these weird conversations with people

**01:14:38** sometimes like, why can't you just FaceTime me? And they're like, no, let's do a Zoom call. I'm

**01:14:42** like, no, I don't want to. I just, I don't like her trust Zoom and I didn't like it from the moment

**01:14:49** I saw it, but it's like somehow this just instantly became the thing that everyone uses

**01:14:57** and talks about like video chat was invented the day Zoom showed up in March 2020.

**01:15:05** Well, Zoom's been around for a long time and it's been used in a lot of professional settings. And

**01:15:11** it does some interesting stuff for like large group podcasts, like Zoom can record, right? For you.

**01:15:18** So I've done it in those kinds of settings. That's how I have been aware of Zoom for a while,

**01:15:24** because it was like a, it has been a Skype replacement for some people that I work with.

**01:15:31** Zoom worked because it had the lowest barrier to entry for joining a call.

**01:15:40** It made it very easy to join calls. Like Zoom's real thing was that you could click a link and

**01:15:47** join a call and you didn't need an account and you didn't need to download an app necessarily.

**01:15:53** And like the way that it dealt with a lot of that stuff was much, much easier, I think,

**01:15:58** than a lot of its competitors. Now, unfortunately, this ended up being a slight fall from grace for

**01:16:07** Zoom, because some of the ways that they were doing things to make them easy were not necessarily

**01:16:12** secure. And they have tightened up some of that stuff. But at this point, it doesn't matter because

**01:16:22** Zoom made it so easy for so many people, they have become the tool, right? So now that they

**01:16:30** have actually done some work to make it harder to join a Zoom call, because it's now more correct

**01:16:37** than its security than it was before. It's now become the verb. So just matter now, Zoom is the

**01:16:44** verb. So to video call someone in 2020 and beyond is to Zoom them. And that's just that. So I use Zoom.

**01:16:53** The one thing I like about Zoom is that now everyone uses one application, because before

**01:17:00** I would have calls of people and I had to have WebEx accounts, Zoom accounts, Google Meet accounts,

**01:17:07** Cisco accounts, and they would want to set up a call and it would be like,

**01:17:13** join one of these 20,000 different services. At least now everyone has a Zoom account. So we can

**01:17:19** all agree on Zoom. Not me. I am the final holdout. Yeah, but you know, by and large,

**01:17:28** most people that work with you already have a thing. So like if somebody, if you're meeting

**01:17:34** with someone for the first time, what do you use then? The hierarchy here is FaceTime and then

**01:17:40** Skype. That's the hierarchy. Okay. Because again, the great thing about Zoom is it's available

**01:17:46** everywhere, right? Yeah, which FaceTime obviously isn't. But I feel like I haven't run into anyone

**01:17:52** yet who doesn't have one of those two. I guess way lower down, like one in a thousand is Google

**01:18:00** Meet, but that's incredibly rare. I hate that one. I don't know why though.

**01:18:08** I don't have enough experience with it, but I have that same feeling with Zoom. Like I don't

**01:18:13** have good reasons, but I just, I feel viscerally repelled by Zoom. And so yeah, I try not to use

**01:18:20** it if I possibly can. I mean, I like it for the stuff that I use it for in the sense of it has

**01:18:24** good features. It's easy for my family to all get on a call if we're doing something. It's easy to

**01:18:31** do group calls and they can be recorded in case somebody misses it and it's all done automatically.

**01:18:37** You know, like it does the job. I can see why it's worked for people. You know, like it's very

**01:18:43** specific set of features that it has worked very well for the pandemic and everybody else had to

**01:18:51** catch up if they caught up. You know, like Slack, I mean, geez, just doesn't have these features.

**01:19:00** And it's wild to me, which is one of the reasons why Teams has done so well for Microsoft.

**01:19:08** Because Teams has all this stuff built into it, which is also kind of funny because Microsoft

**01:19:13** on Skype. I always forget that. I forget that Microsoft on Skype now. I think Microsoft forgot

**01:19:20** because they built a whole new, like the calling in Teams is not based on Skype. It's not Skype.

**01:19:26** It's Teams chat. That's crazy. But I think my understanding is for what it needs to be is better

**01:19:34** than how Skype would deal with it. You know, is there anything I've missed out from communication

**01:19:40** for what's going on in your world? Yeah, I'll just add one more thing, which is a sort of

**01:19:44** follow up from last year. It sort of goes to your not liking threads on Slack. So again,

**01:19:51** within my own company, there's this little bit of a distinction between Slack is for communication,

**01:19:59** but there needs to be somewhere else for the actual like information or tasks or like what

**01:20:06** needs to be done. It's easy to just lose stuff in the stream of people talking for like, what

**01:20:11** were the actionable items or, you know, what's that piece of reference material? And so last year,

**01:20:16** I was using Dropbox paper as this auxiliary layer to Slack where like tasks and things would go in

**01:20:25** there. This is also one of these situations where you're working with someone else. So my assistant

**01:20:30** eventually said she wanted to transition away from paper to Notion for this layer.

**01:20:36** Because she's an architect, right?

**01:20:38** She is totally an architect and she is part of the Notion nation. And so she wanted to transition

**01:20:44** to Notion. And while there are things that I still don't love about Notion, it is obviously

**01:20:52** the vastly better tool for her, which makes it the vastly better tool for me as well. And so

**01:20:59** all of the like back end data for my company all exists in Notion when there are things that my

**01:21:08** assistant needs me to do, like that's in a task list in Notion. And it is really nice, like Notion's

**01:21:13** ability to say like, here's a task, you know, here's the document that you need to sign. It goes right

**01:21:19** here and to have some additional information about it. This is where Notion does stand strong with

**01:21:24** its ability to like create like an arbitrary database entry for almost anything. And so like

**01:21:30** that ability of being able to collaborate and communicate with tasks is really fantastic.

**01:21:36** And then that is also where again, I have transitioned to a lot of the communication

**01:21:42** between me and my animator is like, we will discuss things in Slack, but all of the actionable items

**01:21:51** like this needs to be changed or this needs to be bigger or smaller or like, you know, whatever,

**01:21:57** all of that exists in Notion as well. So it's like, boom, here's a list of tasks that we can

**01:22:04** collaborate on, like adding and checking off things. So I just find it really useful to try

**01:22:10** to keep that in mind when you're working with people than like where communication happens

**01:22:17** is a separate layer from information and task tracking and like, don't confuse those two. And

**01:22:25** if you do so, you do that at your peril. So I used to use paper for it and now I use Notion for it,

**01:22:32** which was not my decision, but was a very good decision. Fantastic. L3 is still my calendar app

**01:22:39** of choice. Well, the version three is the new version of Fantastic. That has come out in the

**01:22:44** last year. It's a great update. It gave me the two features that I wanted the most.

**01:22:49** The iPad version is basically the Mac version now, which looks, it just looks exactly the same. So I

**01:22:53** have all the functionality I want and calendar sets are also available now. So you can group

**01:22:59** together calendars and just check which ones you want to see at a specific time, which I really,

**01:23:04** really like. So, oh, the widgets are also fantastic. You know, I love Fantastic. I have

**01:23:08** done for years and it got, it got a lot better this year, which I'm really happy about.

**01:23:14** Yeah. I mean, there's nothing more to say than it's the best calendar app by a lot.

**01:23:18** It's, it's, it's fantastic. That calendar. Oh, wow. I wonder if that's why they called it that.

**01:23:26** I've also been using a tool called Doodle. I've included this pick in case you ask from looking

**01:23:32** at my home screen. Yeah. What's Doodle? It is a tool to get a bunch of people to agree on a time

**01:23:40** to have a call. Ah, okay. So as the person creating the Doodle, I say like, these are the days I am

**01:23:48** available and the times, and I would send it out to eight of my people and they can all go in and

**01:23:52** check what they want to do. Fantastic. How actually has this feature itself. Does it? I didn't know.

**01:23:58** Yeah. It's called proposed time. But I haven't really played around with that yet. And I have

**01:24:04** a friend who tried to use this recently to send a thing to me and he ended up not making the call.

**01:24:11** Because it didn't add it to his calendar the way that he was expecting. So, but Doodle was a thing

**01:24:15** that I, I use and also it's not presupposing that people use calendars the same way that I do.

**01:24:22** I can't, I don't even know if like the people I'm sending these to even use a calendar

**01:24:26** at all. Right. Like I'm not going to make that guess because people use their own tools differently.

**01:24:31** Right. Right. But this is just like, Hey, here's the thing. Now you can come to this meeting,

**01:24:37** however it is, you were reminded of such things, right? Okay. So, you know, cause it's like all

**01:24:42** you're doing is saying I'm also available to these times. And then when it's done, I then create

**01:24:47** an event. So like, all right, great. We're all going to meet at this time. So

**01:24:51** yeah, that's great. I'll take a look at it. I mean, again, this is one of these like mathematical

**01:24:55** things where you have two people, it's not hard to arrange time, but the moment you have three

**01:25:01** people, it's like it's exponentially harder. And then four people and five people, it just explodes

**01:25:06** so fast. And my issue is that the only thing I'm using this for is to arrange a monthly call

**01:25:12** between 10 people. Oh my God. So that's why I started using doodle. It's amazing. It's even

**01:25:19** possible to arrange a call between 10 people. Yeah, I agree. You remember when I said earlier

**01:25:26** about the fact that zoom does recording and that's good, because sometimes not all 10 people can

**01:25:32** agree. Right. Of course. So the fact that zoom can record those calls is great for the people

**01:25:36** that can't make it because it is actually impossible to arrange a call that 10 people can

**01:25:42** make when the creator of the call, that's me only gives three days that they're able to do it on.

**01:25:50** Yeah, that makes sense. I'll just add a quick, quick little thing here related to

**01:25:54** scheduling stuff, which is when we talking about widgets, David Smith's widget Smith has the time

**01:26:01** zone display on, uh, on your phone is what you were using it for to show you like, Oh, here's,

**01:26:06** here's the time zones in a bunch of different places. And you asked why I still had Cal zones

**01:26:12** and I hadn't thought about it at the time, but one thing I do still really like Cal zones for

**01:26:18** is that when you open up Cal zones, it lets you do this thing where you can slide the time zones

**01:26:24** around to see like, Oh, okay. When it's going to be 7 PM in London, you know, what time is it in

**01:26:31** LA or whatever. And so I still use Cal zones a lot for that. And I don't think it will work

**01:26:36** like just having the widget of what time is it now in another time zone is, is actually not very

**01:26:43** often the thing that I want. When I'm thinking about time zones, I'm off often trying to do that

**01:26:48** mental calculation of like plus six hours a week from now, when is that for someone else? And so

**01:26:54** I use Cal zones for that a bunch for meeting, scheduling and planning in the withersmith app.

**01:26:59** There's a section called tools and in tools is a thing called wild time. And in that has a version,

**01:27:07** a simpler version of what Cal zones does. So that that's what I do when I now want to work out

**01:27:12** of time. Can I get to that in one tap? No. Okay. Well, then I'm going to, I mean, look,

**01:27:18** they're both, they're both David Smith apps. So I'm going to keep using Cal zones. If it just

**01:27:24** takes me one tap to get to the thing, I just want to open it and see it. But if he eventually

**01:27:30** abandons that in favor of his new favorite child, then, you know, I'll use the new system.

**01:27:36** The new favorite child just got a pretty cool update, by the way, widget Smith.

**01:27:40** Oh yeah. I saw that roll into my updates. Yeah.

**01:27:42** There's like themes now, which is really great. Cause that's Dave leaning into what people are

**01:27:47** using the application for. Yeah. That's definitely a good decision.

**01:27:50** Which is to make their home screens look nice. And yeah. And so he's done more of that. And I

**01:27:55** really liked that update. This episode of cortex is brought to you by Raycon. Don't know about you,

**01:29:23** this show and all of relay FM. I wanted to include project management this year.

**01:29:30** Okay. What are you thinking with this?

**01:29:31** Well, I realized that I have a tool that I use for some stuff like this and also thinking

**01:29:37** maybe this is an area which I could use to some effect for other stuff.

**01:29:42** Okay. So Trello is the tool that I use for things that I would consider project management.

**01:29:50** And there is one annual project where I manage to Trello and then one which is more ongoing.

**01:29:54** So the annual project is the podcastathon. We arrange the podcastathon in Trello. So this is

**01:30:00** shared between a bunch of people. And effectively, we're throwing all of our ideas in there. And then

**01:30:06** we're moving them around from like column to column in the Kanban system of like how done they are

**01:30:14** from like idea stage to completion stage. And if somebody needs to add things to it,

**01:30:19** you can assign them to it. You know, Trello works pretty well for a project management in that kind

**01:30:23** of sense of like, you have an item and it needs to move through a process to completion. Yeah.

**01:30:29** Right. So we've, it's a great effect actually have used Trello for this. And then even for when it

**01:30:35** comes to actually doing the like run of show for the podcastathon event, we'll create our

**01:30:42** columns and then move these ideas into each hour.

**01:30:49** Okay. I see. Yes. It took me, but yes. Okay. That makes sense. Right. So each item, you know,

**01:30:55** a lot of the items end up being like pieces of content that we will produce during the podcast

**01:31:00** event. And so then eventually once all of the preparation for that content is complete,

**01:31:05** we can then move it into its hour column of when it will appear during the hour event.

**01:31:10** So that's a really interesting way to use a Kanban board. I hadn't hadn't thought about that,

**01:31:13** but that's a, that's a great idea. Yeah, I didn't. It wasn't, wasn't my idea. I think

**01:31:17** Steven set it up that way. It was very clever. But that's, that's something, you know, we use it for

**01:31:23** that. I mean, we also use Trello for like a few other things that relay a family. We use it for

**01:31:28** our annual company goals and projects that we want to achieve throughout a year. We put into Trello.

**01:31:34** If we're working on a high level project of some description, we might use Trello for that. And

**01:31:39** also me and Adina have been using it for setting up the studio, setting up mega studio from a high

**01:31:45** level perspective. I really like Trello for this kind of stuff because it's like, you know, you can

**01:31:50** step back and see how everything's moving through a process of completion. I really like that a lot.

**01:31:58** And, or if you have lots of mini projects inside of a larger project. So like when it comes to

**01:32:04** setting up the studio, the studio is kind of cordoned off into different areas, right? So like

**01:32:09** we have a lounge and then we have like three desks and each of those areas has lots of little things

**01:32:16** that need to be done for it to become complete that area. Right, right. So having a column for

**01:32:23** each of these areas and then all of the different tasks listed in each column, it works really nice.

**01:32:30** So, you know, I'm aware of the fact like this is like very basic project management. So I don't

**01:32:35** know if this is the thing that I need to or want to look into more, but for tasks, big tasks like

**01:32:42** these, I have value Trello this year for that. Yeah, that makes sense. That makes sense.

**01:32:49** I'm kind of surprised that you don't manage your videos of a tool like this because you are working

**01:32:56** with so many people now. Trello is one of those tools that I have visited many times over the years

**01:33:02** and I've always been interested in Kanban systems. I think there's something very nice about them.

**01:33:08** And it fits with your index card, love. Yeah, it seems like it should be right in the bullseye.

**01:33:13** I also think there's, you know, back when I was, you know, working in the glass cube

**01:33:18** in the before times, I think there's a reason that almost every company whose office I could peer

**01:33:23** into, they had like a Kanban board with a bunch of sticky notes that they were moving around. Like,

**01:33:29** it feels like it is the right tool for lots of things. I've just, for me, never personally found

**01:33:38** it to be actually useful in the sense of I've used it a number of times. Like I've tried using

**01:33:46** Kanban systems and Trello boards like for video production process, but it's the only time

**01:33:53** this tool has for me felt like I'm just playing with a task list. Like I'm not really doing the

**01:34:01** thing. I'm just moving these cards, but I'm moving the cards after the, like it just never felt

**01:34:06** useful. But with the increasing number of people who are involved in the video production and the

**01:34:15** increasing number of steps, particularly post-Ecoi incident, this has been a thing that I've been

**01:34:23** talking with people about. And I think it might make sense to even just have like a very high

**01:34:29** level Kanban board to show like what videos are in what stages. So this is something that I just

**01:34:37** feel is investigating and is maybe a tool that I need to think about in a different way where it's,

**01:34:43** it's not like this tool isn't for me. This tool is for creating clarity for the people that I work

**01:34:51** with. Like where are the videos? What looks like it's coming down the pike? And so maybe this is

**01:34:58** something that should exist in the future. The closest thing that I have to project management

**01:35:04** in that sense, which I think I've mentioned before, but as in Slack, like I make a different channel

**01:35:09** for each of the videos and then I explicitly number those channels so that everyone knows,

**01:35:16** like you should be working on things from, you know, one onward. If like I put tasks or things

**01:35:23** to be done in multiple channels, like you always know which one should happen first.

**01:35:28** Yeah. And that doesn't feel like the way to do it.

**01:35:30** Yeah. But so the thing is they're like, that is extremely high level, but it doesn't create the

**01:35:36** concept of where in the process is this individual video.

**01:35:42** Yeah. It feels like to me with that numbering thing, you have maybe started to naturally move

**01:35:51** into needing a system like this. Yeah. Like that, that some that you have now recognized that there

**01:35:58** needs to be this like ordering and or progress. Yeah. This is very normal, I think, for adding

**01:36:06** a new tool or system that you've started to outgrow the process a little bit, or it's you're starting

**01:36:12** to like shoehorn something in. Right. Or, you know, or the other part is what you're doing right here

**01:36:19** is you're using the tool in a way that it's not intended to be used. Like, so you're doing

**01:36:22** something to Slack, which that's not what slacks for, right? Which is what you were mentioning

**01:36:28** earlier about like tasks and Slack. Yes, exactly. And moving them out to Notion now. So yeah,

**01:36:35** it's maybe suggesting that, you know, like even Notion could be. Yeah. Well, I mean, Notion has

**01:36:40** everything inside of it, right? There's Kanban boards inside of Notion. So like that may, that

**01:36:44** may very well be the thing that happens is like, oh, there's a Kanban board that just lives on a

**01:36:48** page in Notion somewhere. Like maybe that's what happens. This is very influx. This is a thing that

**01:36:55** is also one of these areas where I need to think about it because the video production process is

**01:37:03** really fluid. And I'm always a bit cautious about over structuring the video production,

**01:37:10** like a factory, like assembly line is not really something that I want to do. Like I do want to be

**01:37:16** able to be free to drop or pause or delay projects and things like this. So yeah, it's just something

**01:37:23** I'm in the middle of investigating, but I think the way I have to think about it is, is like,

**01:37:27** it's a tool that is clarity for others. It's not a tool that's actually for me. We'll see. We'll

**01:37:33** see what happens in state of the apps 2022. All right. Writing and research. Obviously, these are

**01:37:40** two very different things for the two of us. Yes. But things that we both do in our own way. So

**01:37:46** for me, research this year has really solidified around RSS. It's stuck and I'm using reader five.

**01:37:54** Now I was using reader for last year as a new version of reader, which is not vastly different.

**01:37:59** It's just like really, really beautifully polished. The app added a bunch of features,

**01:38:04** but they're not features that I particularly want, but could be really useful for people in that you

**01:38:09** can now use reader as your RSS subscription tool via iCloud, which is very clever.

**01:38:16** What do you mean it shares the RSS feeds over iCloud or it syncs them?

**01:38:20** Yeah. So you can add them to reader and then reader syncs all of that to your other devices

**01:38:25** using iCloud. So you don't actually need to have another service. Ah, okay. Right. Right.

**01:38:30** So I use like feed bin or feedly. I don't even know what one I use, but I use one of these services.

**01:38:36** That's just syncs with reader. And it also like beefed up its read later support. So it has like

**01:38:41** read later function inside of reader as well. So you can, you don't need like an insta paper or

**01:38:45** something. How do you think it compares to insta paper? I don't, I don't know. You've never

**01:38:50** used it. Okay. I don't do that kind of thing. Like I don't like have this thing where I can

**01:38:56** come across articles and I'll like send them to a thing to read later because I don't use RSS for,

**01:39:03** this sounds weird. I don't use it for reading. I know that sounds really strange. You must be,

**01:39:09** you're skimming, right? Like you're, you're skimming, you're hunting, you're looking for things,

**01:39:13** right? That's what you're doing with RSS. Mostly I'm pulling stuff out and sending it to notes to

**01:39:18** read later for actual, when I sit down to do my research for a show, I will read the occasional

**01:39:26** thing in reader. Like there'll be an article that I'll see and would like, I'll read that,

**01:39:30** but I'm not really like as well known. I'm not like this reading person. So I kind of like

**01:39:35** come across an article and I'm like, Oh, I must save that to read later. Like I don't,

**01:39:40** this is not really a thing that I feel, you know, like, Oh, somebody shared this article on Twitter

**01:39:45** must make sure I sit down with my morning coffee tomorrow and read it. Like I know this is a very

**01:39:50** normal thing for many people, but it isn't for me. So reader is an absolutely excellent tool for me to,

**01:39:58** whenever I want to go in, see a bunch of headlines, maybe click through the occasional one to see if

**01:40:05** it's something I want to like, I'll skim it. Is this what I want to read more about? Yes. Then

**01:40:09** I will use the share extension to send that out to notes to add it to say upgrade follow up note.

**01:40:15** So then when I sit down to actually do my work for upgrade, I have all my links, I open them all,

**01:40:21** read what I need. Right. Right. So it's, it's mostly a triage tool, but it is the most effective

**01:40:28** way for me to ingest a vast amount of information in a short period of time. I'm really glad that

**01:40:34** the RSS move for you has worked out. I almost feel happy to know like RSS, it isn't dead yet. Like it

**01:40:41** can still be done, right? A professional can still rely on this protocol for what it was intended.

**01:40:47** Like the, the ability to survey websites and, and collate them all in one place. So I'm, I'm,

**01:40:52** I'm really glad to know that that worked out. Yeah. I'm very happy with it. When it comes to

**01:40:56** writing, I mean, the stuff that I write takes many different forms and none of it is even close to

**01:41:04** what you do. Right. And it's all very similar for me. So the most, the app that I've read the most

**01:41:09** in or the service I write the most in is Google docs, right? Right. The most writing I do on a

**01:41:15** weekly basis is outlines for podcasts. And so that is all in Google docs. Before Google docs,

**01:41:24** they live in notes, as I explained earlier, but if I needed to write a document, if I needed to write

**01:41:29** a blog post, or if I needed to write something long form, I'm still using bear for that just

**01:41:35** because it works and I've had bear for years and it's just a simple markdown app for me.

**01:41:43** I'm just curious when you say write something long form, like do you have any examples this

**01:41:48** year of the kind of stuff that you've written in bear? I'm just trying to imagine what that would

**01:41:52** even be. Sponsor copy is something that I would write. Ah, okay. That makes sense. And I don't do

**01:41:56** very much of that, but I do it occasionally. And if I'm going to do that, I will use bear for that.

**01:42:02** Okay. Yeah. That makes sense. That seems like a good use of that tool. Yeah. Cause it's like,

**01:42:05** you know, it's, it's not long. There's a few hundred words or whatever. And, and it's nice

**01:42:10** to have just a simple application that I can easily format because the tool that we put our

**01:42:16** copy into reads markdown. So it will be formatted for me to read or for whoever's going to read

**01:42:23** the ad in a way that is clear and makes sense. So, okay. Are you still on Ulysses?

**01:42:32** Oh, last year it was like, Ulysses is amazing. The developers do whatever I want. No, no. Okay. Okay.

**01:42:39** So the, so the, that's why is because yes, I am still on Ulysses and yes, by far it's the best

**01:42:50** tool for the kind of thing that I want to do. Okay. The science is because I feel like there must be a

**01:42:59** like an app design land. There must be a word or like a law for this sorts of phenomenon,

**01:43:06** but it's where you have an app and the app goes through a redesign and it always feels like

**01:43:16** the rule for app redesign always trends toward less information displayed or less options

**01:43:26** displayed at any particular point. So just, it feels like the first version of the app can show

**01:43:32** you lots of things. And then as time goes on, it's like the opposite of what you would expect

**01:43:37** that later versions of the app show you fewer things. And so I have this tremendous frustration

**01:43:44** with Ulysses right now, which is they did an app redesign a couple of months ago, where I was sort

**01:43:50** of horrified at something they changed. And I kept thinking like, well, any day now in the next point

**01:43:56** release, they're going to add the ability to change this around and like, and they just haven't and

**01:44:01** it's killing me. So the very short version of this is in Ulysses for anything that you're writing,

**01:44:09** again, like my constant obsession with index cards, I can have a script. It's displayed to me as a,

**01:44:15** as a single piece of writing, but I can subdivide it into little sections and each of those little

**01:44:22** sections, I can add things that are not part of the script in a sidebar. So I can add like an extra

**01:44:29** little comment to myself, or like here's a reference image, or here's a little reference

**01:44:34** document or whatever. There's like a little sidebar. And that sidebar would also show things like

**01:44:40** how many words are in the overall script that you're working on. How long will it take an average

**01:44:46** person to read this out loud, which is of course, very useful information for me. And this is always

**01:44:51** great, but Ulysses did this redesign where I cannot understand, I can't understand why,

**01:44:59** but what used to be a single panel on the right hand side, they decided to divide it up into little,

**01:45:08** like four little tabs at the top. So if you want to know the word count, you can click on one of

**01:45:15** the tabs. If you want to know how long it takes to read out loud, you can click on another tab to

**01:45:21** see that piece of information. Oh, that's weird. If you want to see the note, like the comment that

**01:45:27** you have on this section of the script, that's a fourth tab. If you have also included a picture

**01:45:36** that is related to this section of the script, that is a fifth tab. And so all of the things

**01:45:44** that I used to be able to see at once have now like pointlessly been divided into five different

**01:45:53** sections that you can't, there's no way to see all of them at once. And I find it totally baffling.

**01:46:00** Like I cannot conceive of who this redesign is for because in the old version, if you didn't

**01:46:07** want to see one of the sections, like you had an option where you could just uncheck it and be like,

**01:46:11** don't show me read out loud time. I don't care. And you know, you wouldn't have to deal with that.

**01:46:16** And that like, there's just, there's no ability to customize this sidebar. It's infuriating. And the

**01:46:22** thing that's really frustrating about it is like, you know, so right now I have a script in front of

**01:46:27** me where I'm writing about a thing and there is a reference photo for this particular section that

**01:46:32** I'm writing. So I have to click on the attached photo sections to see that photo. So say then I

**01:46:40** finished, like I'm looking at that image and I rewrite the little section. And then if I move

**01:46:45** onto the next section, the sidebar of course, stays on the show reference photo tab, which means that

**01:46:55** when I get to the next section, if I have written a comment on that section, the only way I can know

**01:47:02** is to manually click on the show me the comments section, right? Which is infuriating. And also

**01:47:12** keep in mind, one of the things I very frequently want to know is what's the word count, right? Or

**01:47:18** how long is this going to read out loud? So if I ever click to see that information, again, when

**01:47:25** I'm working on the script, I won't know if I've left a comment on any particular section until I

**01:47:33** manually click on the comment section. It is infuriating. Like, and I, I, I really cannot conceive

**01:47:41** of why was this change made or like who on earth requested this? It's, it's baffling to me. So

**01:47:50** my big sigh there is it's extremely hard for me to imagine switching from Ulysses for a bunch of

**01:47:58** the reasons, the way that it works. I really like it, but this redesign has been brutal. And I, and

**01:48:06** I was just so surprised. Like I kept waiting for the next version to come out that would adjust

**01:48:13** this behavior. And as far as I can tell, the app is like, no, this is great. This is totally the

**01:48:18** way it's supposed to work. So that is my real frustration right now with Ulysses. And it's,

**01:48:25** you were talking before about the beautiful synergy with the way you work with an app and,

**01:48:29** you know, the two of you, you're of one mind and you're getting things done.

**01:48:32** Yes. This was the part that I didn't mention about that.

**01:48:36** Yeah. And like, I felt this way with Ulysses and particularly last year, the big request I made

**01:48:44** was specifically for the ability to use all of these amazing sidebar features of adding notes

**01:48:50** and images and seeing information about what you're working on, like while you're working on it.

**01:48:55** And it's like, Oh, I had seven glorious months until this redesign, which just destroyed all of

**01:49:01** the value in the sidebar. So again, I'm, I'm really frustrated with that, but Ulysses still for me is

**01:49:10** the best. It's still the best because of the way that you can divide up text.

**01:49:14** It's the best because of the way it's really easy to rearrange things. They have very lightweight,

**01:49:20** but powerful ways to just say like the, all of these things go together and these things don't,

**01:49:26** you know, to mark different parts of a script to say, don't include this in the word count

**01:49:31** because this is like meta information. You know, there's just so many nice things about it.

**01:49:36** It's, it's very hard to move away, but it feels a little bit like I had a perfect tool

**01:49:44** and then it got pointlessly hobbled, which is just a frustrating experience. So Ulysses

**01:49:50** is still the app that I'm using to write my scripts. This episode of Cortex is brought to you by

**01:52:18** Lightning round time. Lightning round. You want to go first?

**01:52:23** Uh yeah, I was just trying to think of how to make a lightning. What I was trying to think there is

**01:52:27** yeah, but lightning sound effect that's not an upgrade laser sound effect, right?

**01:52:33** That's...

**01:52:33** That's not a sound effect.

**01:52:34** Yeah, I was like...

**01:52:36** Right? Like what's lightning sound like? I don't know. It's hard.

**01:52:39** Does lightning have a... Yeah, it does. Thunder is the sound lightning makes, right?

**01:52:44** Yeah, like it's like a crack.

**01:52:46** Yeah.

**01:52:46** Pow! Lightning.

**01:52:47** Crack pow!

**01:52:48** Whizbang!

**01:52:50** Does it whiz and bang?

**01:52:51** Zoom.

**01:52:51** I don't know. Look, it's hard. This is lightning sounds. Lightning round.

**01:52:59** Okay, do you want to alternate? Should we do it that way? Let's alternate with stuff really quick.

**01:53:02** Okay, I'm not going to talk about it right now because I talked about it so much last year,

**01:53:06** but lightning round. FitBOD is my exercise app, which I also believe is a sponsor of this episode.

**01:53:11** Correct.

**01:53:12** But I cannot possibly skip over it in a state of the apps without mentioning it.

**01:53:17** FitBOD is my exercise app of choice. I loved it last year. And boy, did I not know how important

**01:53:25** it was going to be this year in lockdown time. So without exaggeration, FitBOD is definitely

**01:53:31** the app that has made the biggest physical impact on my life this year. If you're looking for an

**01:53:38** exercise app, this is my number one recommendation to everyone. Love it.

**01:53:43** I'm not going to say anything about it.

**01:53:44** Because at this point, you have already said something about it.

**01:53:47** I've already said something about it. And I don't want to cross those streams.

**01:53:51** Right.

**01:53:52** Twitch. I'm going with. I've been watching lots of Twitch streams as I've been getting further and

**01:53:57** further into the mechanical keyboard hobby over the last few months. And the Twitch app on iOS is

**01:54:05** fantastic because it does everything you want it to do. And it also has really great picture in

**01:54:12** picture support, which is so needed for Twitch.

**01:54:15** Oh, yeah, that's really nice.

**01:54:17** Because Twitch streams are usually very long and usually for lots of lots and lots of stuff

**01:54:24** that you would watch a stream for. It's not like must focus viewing. Right. Like you

**01:54:31** can lots of a very normal way to use Twitch is in the background. And quote in the background

**01:54:37** of an iOS device is in picture in picture. Right. So you can still glance at it when you want to.

**01:54:42** But you can also be doing other things. And Twitch was one of the first apps that I used that

**01:54:48** took advantage of the iPhone picture in picture. And it works great for that too.

**01:54:53** So the app has everything you want it to have. And also really does a good job of integrating

**01:55:00** the things that it should to make it great. Looking at you, YouTube.

**01:55:07** It's crazy. YouTube doesn't do picture in picture support.

**01:55:09** I cannot believe at this point that they do not have it available on iOS. I believe on it is on

**01:55:14** Android. But even if it's just for premium, right. Because you can do background listening.

**01:55:21** I know.

**01:55:23** If you're a YouTube premium subscriber, you know, they have said that they were working on it,

**01:55:27** I believe a long time ago. But I can't believe they don't have it at this point.

**01:55:31** My assumption is the only reason they haven't done it is because the way that they serve their ads

**01:55:38** as separate video files, I can imagine might mess up what iOS wants to do.

**01:55:44** Right. But that's why just do it for premium then if you if this is your problem.

**01:55:47** Oh, yeah. No, I completely agree. I completely agree. But I think they're like, no, no, no,

**01:55:51** we're not going to do this until we can we can make sure that you see an ad picture in picture

**01:55:56** without us having to like swap out the files or whatever. So that's that's my guess. But it's

**01:56:00** infuriating. It's absolutely infuriating. Okay. Lightning round. I have first VR app

**01:56:08** recommendation for lightning round. Oh, we talked about VR. This is definitely my year of the VR.

**01:56:14** You know, there's the classics like Beat Saber, which everyone will love. You got to play Beat

**01:56:19** Saber. If you play Beat Saber, I don't have asked you this. If you played the Beat Saber

**01:56:24** in like 360 degrees. Yeah. Yeah. I played it. I played it. Super good. If you've not tried that

**01:56:30** and you have a quest and maybe you you play Beat Saber a long time ago on a different system or

**01:56:35** whatever in 180 and 360 degrees, it's a totally different game and it's fantastic.

**01:56:41** Yeah, it is fun. I also recommend it. It seems like you people might not like it,

**01:56:45** but I've also really enjoyed the one handed mode sometimes like some of the songs. I feel like it's

**01:56:51** it's a fun, slightly different experience doing it with just one saber instead of two sabers. But

**01:56:58** anyway, Beat Saber is not my lightning round recommendation, even though it's played a

**01:57:02** surprisingly important important role in my life. If it's not your pick, it's not my pick.

**01:57:08** We just make it a pick. No, it's not. It's not the pick. We just got a we got a side of the

**01:57:13** my actual pick for this lightning round is a VR game called In Death. And it is amazing. It is

**01:57:25** a game where you are an archer and you are traveling through this weird infinite church

**01:57:33** in heaven trying to clear it out from monsters and bad guys. Okay. It's just an incredible VR

**01:57:40** experience. Like they just they've designed everything really well. I have rarely met a game

**01:57:46** that gets the difficulty ramp so perfect where every time it feels like a challenge and the game

**01:57:53** just slightly cranks up the difficulty with enemies. Whatever team did the like graphic

**01:58:01** design memory constraints should deserve some kind of award because it's like they do not

**01:58:07** waste a single pixel or a single polygon. Like it's the graphic quality is shockingly good

**01:58:16** given the limitations of the quest and like the number of enemies that they can have on screen at

**01:58:20** once. I've just rarely seen anything handle it so well. And it is just super fun to be an archer

**01:58:28** who can teleport around. Like the only downside is you learn how physically difficult it is to be

**01:58:35** an archer but that's also an upside. Is it scary? I mean I don't think it's scary. You might find it

**01:58:42** a little scary Mike but I can say that if you just avoid what are obviously portals to hell

**01:58:50** then you can avoid most of the scary stuff. Okay. You can still play it with like some enemies.

**01:58:55** All right I'll try it out then. I really mean it. It's just a very enjoyable VR experience

**01:59:02** by far my favorite game on the quest that I've tried and I've tried like everything on that store.

**01:59:09** I have to mention it because otherwise it wouldn't be a state of the apps. Time-ery for time tracking.

**01:59:16** Yeah of course. What can we say? We've used it for years. It's amazing. I just really want it to be

**01:59:21** on the Mac now. Oh yeah I guess I didn't even think about that but of course it can be on the Mac.

**01:59:27** As of right now it is not on the Mac. Yeah but I said it can be. It can be. But it isn't yet.

**01:59:36** With timing stuff I'll quickly mention the timer that I found last year which I really like and

**01:59:41** have integrated much more into shortcut stuff is Just Timers. It is an app that is just timers with

**01:59:48** good shortcut supports and I've built this into just a ton of my own time tracking shortcuts to

**01:59:54** like start a 120 minute timer or you know start a seven minute timer when I also start tracking

**02:00:02** this time. I really like it and I find it's a great companion for time tracking. Air Table. So

**02:00:10** I've moved away from the old favorite pipe drive sales management tool. Oh my goodness. We moved

**02:00:15** everything to air table now. I'm shocked. So you know how. What about your tactile feedback? Well

**02:00:22** okay. Paul went out for the great tactile feedback of pipe drive and it's button pressing.

**02:00:28** I'm genuinely sad for you here. You know how your assistant said I would like to use Notion now?

**02:00:34** Yes. So my sales manager Carrie decided that she had used air table enough that everything needed

**02:00:42** to live in air table and strongly recommended that we move the final part of our sales management

**02:00:48** flow to air table away from pipe drive. Basically it ended up being worthwhile to have just one

**02:00:53** database of all of our clients that can be displayed in the many different ways the air

**02:00:58** table can display a database depending on what information you need to see which is really great

**02:01:03** except their iOS app is terrible. I hate it. I hate it so much. I hate it. So I use the website.

**02:01:11** The reason I hate is air tables whole thing is like give us a bunch of information and our thing

**02:01:16** is you can view it in many different ways. So you can view it as a spreadsheet. You can view it as a

**02:01:21** database. You can view it as a like lots of filters. You can view it as a Kanban our favorite word of

**02:01:26** the show. Yeah. But on iOS none of these things work and they've always said like we're working

**02:01:32** on bringing them over for years and they've never done it. So one of the great things about iPadOS

**02:01:39** is that you can use these complex websites now. And so it's just a tab in Safari for me on iPadOS.

**02:01:48** So it makes me so mad because what makes me mad is in the app right. I'm going to open the app now

**02:01:54** because I need to read exactly what it says just for the sake of it. OK. This view can't be displayed

**02:01:59** in the iOS app yet. Please use air table dot com in a desktop browser to display and edit it yet.

**02:02:07** How many years has yet been a thing at a table yet is always true. Just don't make an app.

**02:02:14** If you're not going to bother adding the features to it that make your service a thing that people

**02:02:19** want to use. I don't use it on my iPhone or basically it's just on my iPad and on my Max. But

**02:02:28** this is one of those things where for her is such a great tool and the things that Kerry has done

**02:02:35** with it make it my frustration not important because we do really have so much information

**02:02:44** all in one place now that is worthwhile. Yeah. But I hate the app.

**02:02:54** OK. I'm going to lightning round a little app called Home Design 3D. Now it has it has a yellow

**02:03:02** icon. The reason I'm mentioning this is because I'm going to find the exact link for you because

**02:03:08** the app store is littered with absolutely garbage home design apps for like oh how am I going to

**02:03:14** lay out this room. All right. There's a million of them and most of them are terrible. They're

**02:03:20** absolutely terrible. But when I was planning what my new home office would be I realized at some

**02:03:27** point like I need to think about this with an actual app that can lay out desks and arrangements

**02:03:32** and I can see it in 3D and everything was terrible until I found this one in particular. So if anyone

**02:03:38** is trying to design a room in their house or their whole house let me save you a bunch of effort and

**02:03:44** just tell you which app to use. It's called Home Design 3D but they're all called Home Design. So

**02:03:50** I'll give the actual link to Mike so he can put it in the show notes. OK. I'm looking now and I

**02:03:55** don't think I can find it. So I'm definitely going to need your help. Oh I guarantee you if

**02:04:00** you search for home design you're not going to find it. Like that's why I'll give you the link.

**02:04:05** Deliveries is one of the all time great iOS apps for parcel tracking and it got a really nice visual

**02:04:11** update this year. This has been an application I have really gotten a lot of use out of in 2020

**02:04:18** because I have to get everything delivered now because I don't go out to buy things anymore.

**02:04:23** Is Amazon an app? Can I pick Amazon? If you wanna.

**02:04:31** I'll tell you I've opened the Amazon app more this year than the past five years.

**02:04:35** Deliveroo is my next pick. Deliveroo. For sure. Yeah. Deliveries is a really,

**02:04:42** really fantastic iOS app. Other quick little one is an app called Double Take. This was demoed on

**02:04:50** stage at Apple last year, the year before as one of their cool new things that you can do with

**02:04:56** the new operating system. It took a long time to actually come out but it's the app that lets you

**02:05:02** shoot video on two of the cameras at once on the iPhone. Oh Double Take by Filmic. OK. Yes Double

**02:05:10** Take by Filmic. Did they never add this to the Filmic Pro app then? So as far as I can tell it

**02:05:15** is still not part of the Filmic Pro app. Something bad happened there didn't it?

**02:05:20** That's what it feels like. Because this was supposed to be a feature coming to Filmic Pro

**02:05:25** and I guess it just never did that. This is also partly why I'm mentioning now is I feel like it

**02:05:30** just got spun off into its own thing and many people might have forgotten this is even a thing

**02:05:36** that you could do because it just never seemed to appear where it was supposed to. But it does

**02:05:41** exist as an app and obviously this is a really edge case niche use but if you want to record

**02:05:49** from two cameras at once you can do it and sometimes that's a really useful thing to be

**02:05:54** able to do. So Double Take, lightning round. I'm a simple man. I have simple needs. When it comes

**02:06:00** to Reddit I use an app called Novel. Right. It's super simple and that's what I like about it and

**02:06:07** everyone says use Apollo and like use Apollo. Every time I download Apollo I feel like I

**02:06:13** it's more than I want from Reddit because every time I download it I'm like okay

**02:06:19** this doesn't look like what I want it to look like and I know I can get it to look like what

**02:06:24** I want it to look like but at that point I've just recreated Narwhal again. So I go back to Narwhal

**02:06:31** every time. It's really nice. It's really simple. I don't use Reddit very much. I don't look at any

**02:06:39** of the popular subreddits. Right. Like I'm not I don't like the front page or anything like that.

**02:06:45** I just subscribe to a couple of subreddits and that's it. And so Narwhal is all I ever need.

**02:06:53** Okay my next pick is going to be an app called Zero and Zero is maybe one of the simplest apps

**02:07:01** I've ever used. It is just a timer that is specifically designed for fasting. Many years

**02:07:10** ago I successfully won the war on breakfast and breakfast was no more in my life and I've been

**02:07:17** experimenting with expanding that battlefront to the war on lunch which we can all agree is the worst

**02:07:24** deal. You're just planning one meal a day now? What are you doing? Look, maybe, right? But if

**02:07:31** you are interested in fasting for whatever reason and you want a little timer to keep track of it

**02:07:38** it's a dead simple app but it's just nicely designed and so Zero is a fasting tracking timer.

**02:07:46** It doesn't if I'm looking at the right one it doesn't look that simple. It's like a lot of

**02:07:50** stuff in it like coaching and... No, like yeah all the you don't need any of that stuff right?

**02:07:55** Okay all right ignore that stuff. That's the oh you want to give us money? Great now we can provide you

**02:08:00** with things that you almost certainly don't need. Like you can you just use the app without any of

**02:08:03** the in-app purchase stuff. It's just a very nice little timer and it has a nice little widget to

**02:08:08** go along with it. PCalc. What I am picking specifically about my favorite calculator app

**02:08:15** is the most recent version of PCalc on the Mac has added something I didn't know I wanted until

**02:08:22** it existed which is a menu bar widget. Oh. So I want that. In Big Sur the old widget for PCalc

**02:08:32** can't exist anymore because Big Sur widgets are the same as iOS widgets are written in SwiftUI

**02:08:39** basically. So James Thompson, developer of PCalc, took the old widget and made it a menu bar item.

**02:08:48** So now with a keyboard command I can bring down a calculator whenever I want on my Mac and I love it.

**02:08:56** Awesome. I didn't know that was new. I need to add this. Yeah it's super good. Show widget in menu bar.

**02:09:03** Check. There you go. Sweet. Oh that's great. It's a great little feature because then you know like I do

**02:09:10** command option C for Fantastic Cal and now command option P for PCalc. You know like these are just

**02:09:16** like two little apps I bring down whenever I need them and it works super good and you can also have

**02:09:22** it where the widget and the calculator can stay in sync. So if you're like oh no I need to do

**02:09:28** something a bit more complicated here you can just open the full application and it will work. I just

**02:09:33** think it's a nice little feature and like it's just like a really great way that James has turned a

**02:09:40** negative into a positive. Oh yeah this is great. This is fantastic. Super good right. I need to use this a lot.

**02:09:45** Very into that. Very into that. Okay my final pick for the lightning round is barely an app. Okay.

**02:09:52** It's an app called Dark Mode on iOS and it is an app that installs but what it really is is it's

**02:10:01** one of those extension actions in Safari and it can force a sort of fake dark mode on a web page

**02:10:12** in the Safari browser on iOS. Wait is this the same thing as the dark mode? No dark reader okay.

**02:10:19** No but you're thinking of the thing on your Mac right which you install and just makes everything

**02:10:24** a dark mode all the time. By the way just as a bit of follow-up. Yeah. Many people wrote in to tell me

**02:10:31** if you click the settings button in that dark reader app you can uncheck enable on all websites

**02:10:37** which is what I wanted so you can opt in to things being dark mode rather than opt out.

**02:10:43** Oh cool I didn't know that. Yeah this it's not very clear I mean honestly I didn't even know

**02:10:48** there was a settings button until until people told me there was one. I think I've never thought

**02:10:52** about it. It's got the word settings there at the bottom but for some reason I completely missed it.

**02:10:57** So yeah I would miss that too because I would just be looking for a little gear and it wouldn't

**02:11:01** matter. It could say settings right here. There's a gear right next to it but the gear is not very

**02:11:05** clear it's not a clear gear. Okay that's good to know. As far as I can tell you can't replicate

**02:11:10** that sort of app on iOS but this little dark mode app if there's ever a website like on my iPad where

**02:11:17** I know I'm going to be reading a bunch of this and the Apple reader mode doesn't properly parse the

**02:11:25** page this is always my little fallback where you can hit the share square and there's the dark mode

**02:11:32** extension button that you can press and I don't know how on earth it does it but then it turns

**02:11:37** just that web page into a dark mode. So I really like that like I said barely an app but boy do I

**02:11:44** love it when I need it. I think you're gonna need to to send me that one because this is not easy to

**02:11:49** find. Yes this is another one where searching for the words is almost certainly not going to be

**02:11:55** helpful so I will provide you with the direct link to this little applet. I have two last picks for

**02:12:00** the landing round. One is Carrot Weather because like Timery I feel like I have to mention it

**02:12:04** Carrot Weather is just one of the best iOS apps ever made continues to get better if you want

**02:12:09** a weather app this is the one to get and Alfred for the Mac. Yeah yeah Alfred's nice. It's one

**02:12:17** of these applications that I use so much that I don't think about it and so I thought I would

**02:12:25** mention it. It's so many things it's a replacement for Spotlight and I've been using Alfred I think

**02:12:32** before Spotlight existed so it's got that for me but it also does so much stuff like and one of

**02:12:38** the things that I really value is it's my clipboard manager as well so it keeps my clipboard history

**02:12:45** when I'm on my Mac. So I can copy and paste multiple things and then go to other fields and

**02:12:50** just bring up what I need and just drop them all in but yeah Alfred is one of these applications

**02:12:54** it's like a Swiss army knife. Yeah I forget that it's even a clipboard manager like it does so many

**02:13:00** things. So much stuff. One of my main reasons for using it over Spotlight is just a simple feature

**02:13:05** which I don't know if it's the it's like I just have the keyboard commands in my default memory

**02:13:10** but it's like if I'm in Finder and I have a file selected with just a couple of keyboard commands

**02:13:17** I can say oh open this file in Alfred and then Alfred gives you a bunch of options of like hey

**02:13:25** what do you want to do with this file? Yeah. And I can say move it over here. File actions they're

**02:13:30** called in. Yes file actions it's so great to be able to like act on a file that you have selected

**02:13:38** in the Finder and just I almost exclusively use it to move things like when I'm just going through

**02:13:44** all the files on my desktop to be able to say like okay this goes over here this goes over here this

**02:13:49** goes over here like it's just so nice to be able to do that without having to open up the folder

**02:13:54** and like drag and drop stuff over. I use that a lot Alfred is great. It's got so much stuff like

**02:13:58** another thing that I use it for all the time is if I need somebody's address or contact information

**02:14:04** you can view their contact and copy it really easily from Alfred but it's one of those apps

**02:14:10** that you spend 20 minutes 30 minutes in the preferences for the application and you will

**02:14:15** find three things that you didn't know that it did that can make your time on your Mac even more

**02:14:20** valuable. So that is state of the apps for 2021. Next time yearly themes. Get thinking about those

**02:14:30** themes people. 2021 yearly themes is coming. See you then.
