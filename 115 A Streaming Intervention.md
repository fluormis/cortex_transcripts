# Cortex - 115: A Streaming Intervention
**00:00:00** I have a question for you.

**00:00:01** Have you ever had a hangover?

**00:00:02** Why, why do you, why, what do you mean

**00:00:03** have you ever had a hangover?

**00:00:05** It's a think it's a valid question.

**00:00:06** Not everybody's had a hangover in their life, you know?

**00:00:08** I mean, I guess, I guess it is true.

**00:00:10** Not everyone has had a hangover.

**00:00:12** Obviously everyone who is underage

**00:00:14** has yet to experience a hangover.

**00:00:16** There may be other reasons why you've never had a hangover.

**00:00:19** I haven't had a lot, but I've had them.

**00:00:22** Why do you ask, are you hungover for this recording?

**00:00:24** No, have you ever experienced that feeling from working?

**00:00:31** Oh, okay.

**00:00:32** Because this happened to me yesterday.

**00:00:35** You had a work hangover.

**00:00:36** I had a work hangover, I think, for the first time.

**00:00:39** And it's not something that I knew existed.

**00:00:42** I don't know if it does exist, but yesterday,

**00:00:45** I felt horrifically hungover and I had no alcohol the day before.

**00:00:49** And the only thing that I can attest it to

**00:00:52** is the fact that I was working until, I don't know,

**00:00:56** like one in the morning and still trying to stay awake

**00:01:00** with caffeine and food a time

**00:01:04** when I should have definitely been sleeping.

**00:01:06** Right.

**00:01:07** You've been spending all your cortisol and adrenaline

**00:01:09** on getting things done.

**00:01:11** Yeah.

**00:01:12** And then you are tapped out, my friend.

**00:01:16** Yeah, no, work hangover, I think that's a real thing

**00:01:18** if you've really been going for a whole bunch.

**00:01:20** Work hangovers, yes, you know, regular hangovers, not so much.

**00:01:23** But I'm sorry to hear that you had a work hangover,

**00:01:25** though it is completely understandable

**00:01:28** because it is Apple events time,

**00:01:29** which I totally knew about before you messaged me about it

**00:01:34** and saw it in the show notes.

**00:01:35** It's a busy week for you.

**00:01:40** Yeah, so Tuesday was when the event was,

**00:01:42** and they're obviously later in time anyway, right?

**00:01:45** So if I'm recording, which I am, I recorded with Jason,

**00:01:48** we do our kind of like post event analysis.

**00:01:51** I can't start that until it ended.

**00:01:53** And then I also had some meetings

**00:01:56** to get some more information about the product.

**00:01:59** So all of that just kept pushing the day on and on and on.

**00:02:02** And I think adrenaline is one of the things

**00:02:04** that I can assume was a big factor for how I was feeling

**00:02:09** because I had like a weird feeling after I was finished.

**00:02:11** Like it was kind of like one in the morning,

**00:02:13** I was super hungry and I was like, incredibly sweaty.

**00:02:16** And so like I can assume it, lovely, right?

**00:02:19** I can assume it must have been adrenaline based.

**00:02:22** And I think that set me up for a bad Wednesday.

**00:02:27** I was bad, it was so bad.

**00:02:30** I still had a bunch of stuff to do.

**00:02:32** We did an interview for next week's upgrade

**00:02:35** and again, I'm trying to like get through it.

**00:02:37** And I just, I felt like I was,

**00:02:39** I don't know, like 22 again or something.

**00:02:41** Yeah, I can see in my head, Mike, with the sunglasses

**00:02:45** as you're recording a podcast and drinking coffee.

**00:02:49** From underneath my desk, you know, in the fetal position.

**00:02:53** It reminded me of when like, so, you know,

**00:02:56** I used to work in retail banking

**00:02:59** and my very first jobs in that field was actually working

**00:03:02** in the bank branches, opening bank accounts

**00:03:05** and that kind of stuff.

**00:03:07** And I remember what it was like to work Saturdays,

**00:03:09** having gone out on Fridays.

**00:03:11** That they have a rough times, man.

**00:03:13** And that's what I felt like yesterday.

**00:03:16** I'm so sorry.

**00:03:18** I like, because that's the worst thing

**00:03:20** than the hangover is having to do something, right?

**00:03:24** Working through a hangover is one of the most excruciating

**00:03:27** things a person can go through.

**00:03:29** It's so bad.

**00:03:30** Like if you have to sit in a meeting, you know.

**00:03:32** The universe feels unjust in those moments.

**00:03:38** So I've discovered that it's possible now,

**00:03:42** maybe this is in my advancing age

**00:03:44** that now I can just work too hard and get a hangover,

**00:03:46** which is not a thing that I knew I had to consider.

**00:03:50** But I guess that's kind of where I am in my mid thirties now.

**00:03:53** Happy birthday.

**00:03:54** Here's a new problem for you.

**00:03:58** Oh, I'm so sorry, Mike.

**00:04:00** I'm so sorry that this is now a thing

**00:04:02** that can be part of your annual life.

**00:04:04** Yeah, maybe.

**00:04:06** I made a decision though, which was a pretty good one.

**00:04:09** We had like a positive thinking kind of moment,

**00:04:11** you know, like a positive mental attitude kind of moment.

**00:04:14** I was looking at my calendar and these weeks they were just like,

**00:04:17** it's like dropping a nuclear bomb into my calendar

**00:04:19** because there is a moment on the Tuesday

**00:04:21** that is where like the bomb hits.

**00:04:23** And then the shockwave hits out across the rest of the calendar

**00:04:27** as all of my shows will start getting moved around.

**00:04:30** It's kind of an incredible thing.

**00:04:31** It's like this event occurs and then this has to move

**00:04:35** and this has to move and then having moved

**00:04:36** that means I need to move this and you know,

**00:04:38** and it's just like this.

**00:04:40** I've heard it described a silly season

**00:04:42** and my girlfriend, Merlin, calls it silly season,

**00:04:44** which is like if one person who's in a podcast goes on vacation,

**00:04:47** the effect of that person going on vacation

**00:04:50** can be felt across like four different podcasts, right?

**00:04:53** So I was looking at all of this and I was assessing the amount of work

**00:04:56** that I had to do and all these extra things

**00:04:58** and all my editing projects that I'm going to have to do.

**00:05:01** And I made the decision in that moment to not look at this as,

**00:05:07** oh man, this is so much to do,

**00:05:10** but to choose to feel grateful for it because this is what I wanted

**00:05:15** and it is what I wanted, right?

**00:05:16** This is what I signed up for all of this stuff.

**00:05:18** Like when I set out on this path to try and attain the career that I have,

**00:05:22** it was to get these moments.

**00:05:25** So this week, especially, I am appreciating the work more

**00:05:31** than thinking, oh man, this is going to be hard to get done.

**00:05:35** I'm just choosing to feel grateful for it instead of tired about it.

**00:05:39** I think that's really good because I think about the Mike who I first met

**00:05:45** and he would be thrilled to hear how busy your week is

**00:05:50** because of the things that you're able to do.

**00:05:52** Yeah, the opportunities and that kind of stuff.

**00:05:54** You really work towards this over the years.

**00:05:57** And this is a good example of where trying to reframe something really can work.

**00:06:02** It's like with the journals and if you use them for gratitude journaling,

**00:06:05** like I always say, it's frustratingly effective.

**00:06:07** But this is one of the reasons why that stuff kind of works is you can,

**00:06:12** to a limited extent, reframe things under the right circumstances

**00:06:16** and choosing to be grateful for all of the stuff that you get to do this week

**00:06:22** is like, I'm glad to hear that you did that after hearing that you had to go

**00:06:26** through your work, hang over while also working with your sunglasses on

**00:06:30** and drinking your coffee and the electrolytes.

**00:06:33** I was I was blown up on electrolytes yesterday.

**00:06:35** Is I going to get those in?

**00:06:37** Yeah, electrolytes and bone broth all to be perky on a podcast.

**00:06:44** Not a fan of bone broth.

**00:06:45** I don't like the words.

**00:06:46** I never really thought about it.

**00:06:48** Look, you just like you just grind up a bunch of bones,

**00:06:51** you broth them and then you drink them.

**00:06:53** How does one broth something?

**00:06:56** Look, I don't know.

**00:06:57** I'm not a witch with a cauldron, you know, mixing these things together.

**00:07:01** Toil, toil, bubble and trouble or whatever.

**00:07:03** I have new and all that stuff.

**00:08:33** exercise types of them, body weight only stuff.

**00:08:36** I got some resistance bands and I had a bunch of exercises available to me there as well.

**00:08:40** And I love that as I'm trying out new things,

**00:08:43** there are all these great little videos and instructions with every single exercise

**00:09:06** A thanks to FitBod for their support of this show and Relay FM.

**00:09:10** I opened our document a couple of days ago

**00:09:13** and was met with something that I couldn't conceive of.

**00:09:18** Oh, oh, this is the thing I forgot about.

**00:09:20** Is this the Slack notification flow chart? Yes.

**00:09:24** So I'm going to put a link in the show notes to what I ended up finding,

**00:09:29** which is a blog post from Slack's engineering team where they show off this flow chart.

**00:09:34** And we can talk about what this is in a minute and why it's here.

**00:09:37** But when I first saw this, I thought you had made this.

**00:09:41** Oh, no.

**00:09:41** And this was something that you were trying to, I don't know, tell me how I should be

**00:09:46** sending notifications to you in our Slack or something.

**00:09:48** I was like, oh, God,

**00:09:50** I could just imagine you and your assistant coming up with this system of like,

**00:09:55** when can Gray be notified?

**00:09:57** And that's what I originally thought this was.

**00:09:59** I actually kind of like that as an idea, like the when and how to approach Gray,

**00:10:04** the flow chart. I like that.

**00:10:05** Maybe I should make that.

**00:10:06** I mean, honestly, I would like that because then I would know when I can alert you or

**00:10:10** not. Right. Like what are the types of messages which warrant the at Gray and

**00:10:15** where that they go? Because I will say, since we created the Cortex brand Slack,

**00:10:19** our communication has gotten much more complicated.

**00:10:22** Yes. Because now we have three places and I never really know now where to put things.

**00:10:29** Again, I think we need to have a meeting about this because it's

**00:10:33** everything's gotten more complicated again.

**00:10:36** Yeah, it definitely has gotten more complicated.

**00:10:38** And also, in all fairness to you, this is where I am completely unhelpful with the

**00:10:43** show notes because I was sent this diagram as like, oh, my God, look at how

**00:10:47** complicated Slack notifications are.

**00:10:49** And I thought, oh, I'm going to forget about this.

**00:10:51** Let me just quickly drop it into the show notes with no context, right?

**00:10:55** Not a sentence or anything.

**00:10:57** I just dropped it in as an image.

**00:10:58** And then, of course, promptly forgot that I had ever put it in there.

**00:11:02** So you're presented with this how to run a nuclear power station level flow chart

**00:11:08** that is as absolutely nothing surrounding it.

**00:11:10** I just wanted this as as a little bit of like follow up to our conversations where I

**00:11:15** sometimes express frustration about notifications.

**00:11:18** And we've talked about Slack a whole bunch.

**00:11:21** And even to this day still find it really endlessly frustrating about what do I or

**00:11:27** do not get notified about in Slack.

**00:11:30** And Slack is one of these these weird cases where it tends to be the reverse of I

**00:11:35** actually want more notifications from this system.

**00:11:38** But I sometimes find it hard to get the ones that I'm looking for.

**00:11:41** But anyway, so this flow chart, I just put it in here

**00:11:45** to visually show how it is actually incredibly complicated about does or does

**00:11:52** not Slack notify you when a message takes place.

**00:11:56** And I was really relieved to see this to think, OK, it is not just me.

**00:12:01** This flow chart must have what?

**00:12:04** Two dozen boxes on it, all with yes, no options of, you know, is it here?

**00:12:10** Is it there? Is it under this circumstance?

**00:12:12** What's the global state?

**00:12:13** You know, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

**00:12:15** And so that's why I put it here.

**00:12:16** This this to me is like vindication flow chart.

**00:12:19** Slack notifications are super complicated.

**00:12:22** It's also an incredible example of how you add complication by adding new features.

**00:12:29** Yes, me and I do know we're talking about this yesterday.

**00:12:31** She started selling some prints of the comics that she's been doing.

**00:12:36** She had wanted to test it out and she wanted to set up Instagram shopping.

**00:12:41** Right. Because you can buy things in Instagram.

**00:12:43** Oh, I didn't know that. OK.

**00:12:44** Yeah, it integrates with Shopify, I think.

**00:12:47** And you can just sell stuff.

**00:12:48** Physical prints of the artwork.

**00:12:50** Yeah, she had some postcards made.

**00:12:52** It's like a test of a thing that she wants to try and do more of.

**00:12:55** And she's also doing this as a test for us, for Cortex brand.

**00:12:59** Right. Right.

**00:13:00** Why don't you do this and tell me how it goes?

**00:13:03** See if this is the thing we want to do in the future.

**00:13:04** I don't know. Right.

**00:13:05** It's great to have tasks have two purposes.

**00:13:08** Yeah, exactly. Two purposes is one purposes.

**00:13:10** So, yeah, that's great.

**00:13:11** And so to do it, she had to set up a Facebook page for her Instagram account

**00:13:18** and link them to do a lot of stuff on Instagram.

**00:13:21** You have to have a Facebook page attached to it to do ads and stuff like that.

**00:13:24** So she created the Facebook page, but now it refuses to link them.

**00:13:29** But she's hit some bug and she found a bunch of Reddit threads where people have

**00:13:33** been having this bug for months and we were talking about it last night.

**00:13:36** And it was like, this is an example of you start with a product

**00:13:41** and then you have a bunch of other features and you keep adding like 20 layers on top

**00:13:46** because it doesn't make any sense why to make ads on Instagram.

**00:13:50** You need a Facebook page other than the fact, which is this is the only way they

**00:13:54** could do it without having to remake their system every time.

**00:13:57** So you just keep adding more and more dependencies on top of everything else.

**00:14:01** And like that's this thing with Slack of like because they added threads in.

**00:14:06** It added like 20 more boxes on this flow chart.

**00:14:10** Yeah. Right.

**00:14:11** You can see the word thread message in question marks all over the place.

**00:14:14** Yeah. Because they added this feature in.

**00:14:16** This is like a perfect example of how you can make things more complicated

**00:14:21** for yourself because you try to do them in the most expedient way,

**00:14:25** which is to just add a feature on top rather than trying to fully integrate it.

**00:14:29** And like this is not a criticism on any

**00:14:31** of these companies because it's they all do this right.

**00:14:34** Like this is just you can't every time you have an idea remake all of Facebook.

**00:14:38** You can't, you know, it's like, oh, we've had this great idea.

**00:14:41** Great. We need to start again with Facebook so we can like properly integrate this.

**00:14:45** It doesn't work like that.

**00:14:46** But this is how you end up building these

**00:14:48** like layers upon layers of complexities in such that to send a notification.

**00:14:53** There is one of the most complicated flow charts I've ever seen.

**00:14:57** Yeah, it's great.

**00:14:57** And then and then you think this also then interacts with if you're me,

**00:15:02** your notification system on the phone, right?

**00:15:05** All of this is like before the notification even gets into Apple's system.

**00:15:10** Right.

**00:15:10** Which is, you know, so it's like, oh, great.

**00:15:12** All of these complicated flow charts are

**00:15:14** interacting with other complicated flow charts.

**00:15:16** So anyway, it just I wanted to throw it in here as like, oh, God, it's incredible

**00:15:22** how complicated software can be.

**00:15:25** And this is one of the few cases where I feel like

**00:15:28** I dramatically underestimated what the scope of the problem really is.

**00:15:33** It's like, oh, I thought I was managing five things, but I didn't realize, oh,

**00:15:37** there's 10 things here.

**00:15:38** This is why I can never quite get Slack to work the way that I want to.

**00:15:43** And I even I even learned new things from this flow chart of like, oh,

**00:15:48** there's the difference between at channel, at everyone and at here.

**00:15:53** Right. Which in my head, I just sort of mushed them all together.

**00:15:57** But it's amazing to see this where it's like, oh, okay, this is a mention.

**00:16:01** It's an at here mention.

**00:16:03** Is the user active?

**00:16:05** Like, are they in Slack right now?

**00:16:06** You know, no, then they won't get notified.

**00:16:09** It's like, oh, but if you're using at everyone, it's like, yes, they will get

**00:16:12** notified unless the channel mentions are suppressed.

**00:16:16** Then they won't.

**00:16:17** Right. It's like it's incredible how complicated this is.

**00:16:20** To go to your point, you can easily see how someone at some point says,

**00:16:25** you know, you don't always want to mention everyone in a channel.

**00:16:29** You literally want to know who is here right now.

**00:16:32** And you go, oh, yeah, that's that's a good idea.

**00:16:34** That's a useful feature.

**00:16:35** But then fast forward to onboarding new users a year later.

**00:16:41** And since they haven't seen each of the

**00:16:43** pieces come in and like read the change logs as they get added,

**00:16:47** you just go, oh, at here and everywhere.

**00:16:50** Yeah. All of this is like, how do I talk to everyone in the channel thing?

**00:16:54** It's a very hard design problem.

**00:16:55** Like I do not envy.

**00:16:57** Just to be clear, this is not me being like, oh, Slack is ridiculous.

**00:17:01** This is why I just don't envy the engineers who have to work on it.

**00:17:05** And for a tool that is attempting to manage,

**00:17:09** how does everyone in a company communicate with everyone else?

**00:17:14** It's a really, really hard problem to solve.

**00:17:16** We get to do that thing that we really do,

**00:17:18** where there's some kind of like breaking news that we can bring into the show.

**00:17:23** Because before we started recording today, the WWDC rumors started.

**00:17:27** Right. Oh, I want to read you a paragraph from a Bloomberg report from Markham,

**00:17:31** because I think you might like this.

**00:17:33** OK, I know you hate the rumors when I'm telling you anyway.

**00:17:35** Yeah. I'm like, why are you telling me rumors?

**00:17:37** This is particularly exciting for you.

**00:17:39** Yeah, but they're nonsense.

**00:17:40** It's just no, it's not. It's just a rumor.

**00:17:41** It's just it's not real.

**00:17:42** Company is planning a new feature that will allow users to set different

**00:17:46** notification preferences, such as if the phone makes a sound or not,

**00:17:50** depending on their current status.

**00:17:52** The enhancement will come in the form of a new menu that lets users select if they

**00:17:55** are driving, working, sleeping or custom categories that they're choosing.

**00:17:59** The menu will be shown on the updated lock screen and in control center.

**00:18:02** So basically you may be able to with iOS 15 say, hey, I'm working now.

**00:18:09** And then your phone will send you a very

**00:18:11** limited set of notifications that you can customize.

**00:18:14** Imagine that life.

**00:18:15** Yeah. OK, so this is why I don't like rumors,

**00:18:17** because now you put me in a terrible position.

**00:18:19** I know. I like to do this to you.

**00:18:20** Because now you're like, oh, no, I want it because now you think it might be out

**00:18:23** there. This is very fun for me.

**00:18:24** Right. So yeah, if this doesn't happen, I will be disappointed.

**00:18:28** If it does happen, I will also take credit for the existence of this feature.

**00:18:33** Just assume this is without a shadow of a doubt.

**00:18:35** This only exists because people that make iOS listen to you complain.

**00:18:39** It's like, look, look, Apple engineers.

**00:18:40** I know you're there. I know you can hear me now.

**00:18:43** So so I am I am going to completely take credit if this feature exists.

**00:18:48** But then that only serves to redouble my disappointment if it doesn't happen.

**00:18:52** So thanks a lot, Mike.

**00:18:53** This is like the many years of dark mode.

**00:18:55** Right. Yeah.

**00:18:56** No, this is this is great.

**00:18:58** Breaking news in Cortex.

**00:19:00** I give it two thumbs down.

**00:19:01** Do not want do not repeat.

**00:19:03** Do not notify, please.

**00:19:06** We have a new product that I'm very excited about.

**00:19:08** The subtle notebook.

**00:19:10** The subtle notebook.

**00:19:10** Love it.

**00:19:11** So we obviously have worked very hard on creating the theme system journal.

**00:19:15** And we've had a lot of great feedback about it

**00:19:17** because people just really like to use the theme system journal.

**00:19:20** So we decided to take all of the work that we have done in creating a fantastic

**00:19:25** paper product that is really nice to use and turn it into just a regular notebook.

**00:19:31** So if you love your theme system journal,

**00:19:33** now you can write all of your notes in a book made just like it.

**00:19:36** Or if for some reason you've been wondering, hey, what's all this fuss about?

**00:19:39** But you don't want to be a journal person, which I don't understand.

**00:19:42** If you don't, I think everybody should get a theme system journal.

**00:19:44** But nevertheless, now we have a product for you.

**00:19:47** So it's made exactly the same with the same materials.

**00:19:50** It has a different cover, which is a wonderful kind of slightly

**00:19:53** metallic blue with a more subtle logo, but otherwise is constructed

**00:19:57** identically to the theme system journal as dot grid number pages corner

**00:20:02** perforation so you can keep your place and a lay flat design.

**00:20:05** It's on sale now at cortexmerch.com.

**00:20:08** Yeah, I've got mine right here, right next to me.

**00:20:10** Obviously Mike designed.

**00:20:12** It's beautiful.

**00:20:13** And if you are looking for a high quality notebook, it is obviously we recommend it.

**00:20:20** It's great.

**00:20:21** I love it.

**00:20:21** And it's taken all of the work that you've done for the theme

**00:20:25** system and notebookified it.

**00:20:27** And I also just really love that when you pitch this to me the first time, it was

**00:20:33** we want to take the subtle shirt and turn it into a notebook.

**00:20:37** And that's exactly what has happened.

**00:20:38** I 100 percent love that it matches the shirt so well, like with a nice

**00:20:42** subtle logo on the side.

**00:20:44** It's love it.

**00:20:45** It's so good.

**00:20:46** It is a notebook version of a T-shirt.

**00:20:50** Yes.

**00:20:50** That's what we've made.

**00:20:51** Yeah.

**00:20:52** You're listening to Cortex right now.

**00:20:54** What more do you need to know?

**00:20:56** Cortexmerch.com.

**00:20:59** We need to talk about live streaming.

**00:21:01** Do we?

**00:21:02** Why?

**00:21:02** Why do we need to talk about live streaming?

**00:21:04** I think for a couple of reasons.

**00:21:05** One, I have been live streaming weekly for six months now.

**00:21:09** So I wanted to check in on how that's been going for me.

**00:21:13** But also because you're a live streaming machine who can't be stopped.

**00:21:16** No, I don't.

**00:21:17** I don't know if that's true.

**00:21:18** What?

**00:21:19** Okay.

**00:21:20** If we're going to talk about live streaming, what this actually needs to be is I need

**00:21:24** to learn from your experience of live streaming.

**00:21:28** Gray, that's partly why we're having this conversation.

**00:21:31** Okay.

**00:21:31** Is this like a streaming intervention that's actually occurring?

**00:21:35** Hey, we need to talk about your streaming.

**00:21:37** There's some stuff that we need to talk about, but there's other parts that I'm

**00:21:40** just intrigued about.

**00:21:41** So to kind of give everybody a refresher, I have been streaming weekly at

**00:21:46** Mike.live with keyboard related content.

**00:21:49** This is my new hobby and I've really been enjoying it.

**00:21:52** And every Friday I've been doing a stream for an hour or two where I might be

**00:21:57** building something or looking at some upcoming products.

**00:22:00** This is kind of called like group buyer reviews.

**00:22:02** We look at stuff that's coming down the line and I give my thoughts

**00:22:04** and opinions on the designs.

**00:22:06** And now that I'm back in the studio more, I'm thinking about maybe doing more

**00:22:10** streams and I've actually been wanting to do some game stuff as well.

**00:22:14** And I can maybe do that on different days in the week.

**00:22:16** So I've really been enjoying it.

**00:22:18** And I want to talk a little bit about some of the changes that I've gone through,

**00:22:22** especially from an equipment perspective.

**00:22:24** And also talk about some of the stuff that I've learned from having

**00:22:27** done this for another, like six months.

**00:22:29** So that's where I am right now.

**00:22:31** But now I want to kind of get everybody up to speed and where you are too.

**00:22:34** So in the past, you've been doing some directors commentary live streams, right?

**00:22:38** That's something you've been doing for a while when you post a big video.

**00:22:41** Yeah.

**00:22:42** I feel like I feel like it's been about a year, I guess, that I've been doing that.

**00:22:46** I think since the tumbleweeds video, that was yes.

**00:22:48** Yeah.

**00:22:48** And so, you know, my understanding is they're like, that's like a perk for

**00:22:52** Patreon to where they get like the video and stuff you're direct supports, get the

**00:22:55** videos and you've done some occasional game streams, mostly Mario Kart, if memory

**00:22:59** says, right, but in the past week or so, you've been playing an absolute ton of

**00:23:05** Minecraft and so I'm, I'm keen to understand what triggered this.

**00:23:13** I don't know.

**00:23:14** Okay.

**00:23:14** That's, that's a perfectly fine reason.

**00:23:16** Like saying, I just wanted to do it.

**00:23:18** It's like, great.

**00:23:19** Like, okay.

**00:23:21** Well, no, it's, it's, it's one of these, it's like, um, it's been a weird series

**00:23:26** of escalations combined with just a bunch of timing stuff, but

**00:23:35** okay, so if, if I'm trying to reconstruct it, so there's the background thing,

**00:23:39** which is, which is going on here.

**00:23:42** When I switched my business to be much more direct support and I gave up doing

**00:23:46** embedded sponsorships in the videos, one of the things that had been on my list

**00:23:50** for a really long time is I wanted to have a second place that people could

**00:23:55** sign up to support the channel because sometimes for whatever reason, like

**00:23:59** people don't want to use Patreon.

**00:24:00** They want like a second option was a frequent request.

**00:24:03** And I've been kind of looking at stuff for a while and eventually with the

**00:24:08** timing of it, it's like YouTube has just been rolling out their members program.

**00:24:13** And I got an invitation to be one of the early trial people for this.

**00:24:17** And I thought, okay, let me give this a shot.

**00:24:20** And so I've been trialing that out for, I don't know, maybe six months or so.

**00:24:25** It seems like from the outside, basically they took Patreon and

**00:24:30** Twitch and mushed them together.

**00:24:31** Yeah.

**00:24:32** I mean, I don't know very much about Twitch, so that's hard for me to comment on,

**00:24:35** but I think it is very fair to say that this is YouTube's answer to Patreon

**00:24:41** in a large number of ways anyway.

**00:24:43** So I wanted to just have an answer when people email me and they're like, Hey,

**00:24:47** I want a different option.

**00:24:49** So I've been trying it out and with this actually just goes right into the,

**00:24:54** the like flow chart that we were talking about before was like, as you keep adding

**00:24:59** things, each individual thing makes everything much more complicated.

**00:25:04** There's like a non-linear amount of complication that occurs.

**00:25:08** And so I've been working a lot on trying to make sure that people who sign up to

**00:25:14** become members or patrons, that for the primary two levels that people use,

**00:25:20** everything is as the same as it can be.

**00:25:22** I don't think that the content experience should be different.

**00:25:25** Yeah.

**00:25:25** And that ends up being a lot more work and a lot more difficult than you expect.

**00:25:28** You've got to double the work now.

**00:25:30** Yeah.

**00:25:30** So there's, there is double the work.

**00:25:32** Like, so that, that is the boring business background all to get to the

**00:25:36** sentence of, so what I was trying to figure out how to do and completely failed

**00:25:41** in doing was how can I stream the director's commentaries to both groups of people?

**00:25:51** And normally the way that I've done it is since the director's commentaries are

**00:25:55** for the supporters of the channel, like it's been a private thing.

**00:25:58** Then I was thinking, okay, but how can I stream this to both groups?

**00:26:02** And it's like, Oh God, this is a technical challenge.

**00:26:05** And also a graze internet is not fast enough and not reliable enough challenge

**00:26:11** as well.

**00:26:12** And I basically gave up with, what was it?

**00:26:15** I guess it was the metric paper video.

**00:26:17** I gave up even attempting to do that and just did the director's commentary live

**00:26:23** on the channel instead of having it behind a paywall because I couldn't figure

**00:26:28** out how to do the thing.

**00:26:29** And I was like, well, I don't want to favor one group over the other.

**00:26:32** So, uh, everybody can watch when it's live, I guess now.

**00:26:36** Yeah.

**00:26:36** But then you can do, which I think you have been doing, which I think is, I

**00:26:39** think is a really fair way to do it is then the replay is only available

**00:26:44** for members or page terms, right?

**00:26:46** Yeah.

**00:26:47** Yeah.

**00:26:47** That's what I've, that's what I've done for now.

**00:26:48** This is, um, this is also one of these things where simply because of

**00:26:53** the language issue as well, I've never really had a name for the group of

**00:26:57** people who support the channel, but now that there's two system, it's like, I

**00:27:00** need a way to refer to both of them.

**00:27:02** And so I can come up with the Bonnie B brigade as like an outgrowth of the

**00:27:07** Bonnie B that I've used on the channel for a long time, but again, it's, it's

**00:27:11** one of these things of, I've always avoided any kind of collective name.

**00:27:16** That's fine until you have two systems and now you need one name.

**00:27:21** First, you can just adopt what that system calls their customers, right?

**00:27:26** So like your patrons of Patreon.

**00:27:29** Like I used to just say crowd funders or patrons or whatever.

**00:27:32** Yeah.

**00:27:32** And, and I've used crowd funders a little bit in the past year, but I just

**00:27:36** really hate it as a word.

**00:27:37** I think it's an ugly word.

**00:27:38** That word doesn't mean anymore.

**00:27:40** I think what it used to mean now, like crowdfunding is Kickstarter.

**00:27:44** Yes, exactly.

**00:27:45** It there's, there's like a legacy term way that I'm using it, which is slipping.

**00:27:49** Like you don't, you don't want to get stuck on the old term for forever.

**00:27:52** So I don't know.

**00:27:53** It's just, it's been, it's been this weird time where I've been trying to solve a

**00:27:57** bunch of these weird background technical issues, like the, you know, the direct

**00:28:02** support is totally what the channel relies on and just trying to make this

**00:28:07** work by what I thought was, Oh, I'll just flip a switch and give it a try and see

**00:28:12** how it works.

**00:28:13** I didn't realize, Oh, this is actually going to introduce a much larger

**00:28:17** number of problems than I thought at first.

**00:28:20** But so anyway, I gave up trying to solve one problem.

**00:28:22** I just did the director's commentary live.

**00:28:24** Then I was trying to solve the problem again and accidentally streamed live on

**00:28:30** the channel when I didn't mean to.

**00:28:31** Right.

**00:28:32** And basically just said, okay, F it let's roll with this and I'll just do some

**00:28:37** Mario Kart on the mainstream.

**00:28:39** And then that just opened the flood doors of, Oh, I guess I can just stream on the

**00:28:46** main channel and it's okay.

**00:28:50** Dot, dot, dot.

**00:28:50** Question mark.

**00:28:51** Like I'm not a hundred percent sure.

**00:28:54** It's very early in doing this, which is probably why it's a good time for your

**00:28:58** intervention.

**00:28:59** If you're going to try to direct me here, this is like a very inflection point kind

**00:29:03** of thing.

**00:29:04** Yeah.

**00:29:04** So anyway, it's, it's a combination of, so I sort of opened this door accidentally

**00:29:10** and then, I mean, this is like a whole other side thing, but it's just worked out

**00:29:15** that some of my videos are in a really frustrating stage of development.

**00:29:20** Like I feel really stuck on two of them in these really annoying ways.

**00:29:25** And so I've ended up having a bunch of days work wise that are just kind of

**00:29:30** frustrating after the morning.

**00:29:31** And I feel like I just haven't really accomplished much.

**00:29:35** And so that has totally pushed me to just try to play around with streaming a bit

**00:29:41** more and figure out what's here and what works.

**00:29:45** It originally started with, I can't remember how, but I think someone mentioned

**00:29:49** when I did that Mario Kart stream about Myst, which is a game that I really love.

**00:29:54** Yes, you have my Myst.

**00:29:55** Yeah.

**00:29:55** And just haven't played in literally over 20 years.

**00:29:59** It's very old.

**00:30:00** And I just thought, Oh, that might be just kind of fun to try out on the channel.

**00:30:05** Like I've referenced Myst several times in my vlogs because it had a really big

**00:30:08** aesthetic impact on me.

**00:30:10** And so, yeah, I gave that a try and I don't know.

**00:30:13** It's, I was really happy to just experience the game again.

**00:30:18** Like it was an interesting experience.

**00:30:20** And also, you know, I could use help getting through it because I wasn't going to

**00:30:23** remember all the puzzles.

**00:30:25** Like, you know, it was much harder than I remembered it.

**00:30:28** I thought like, Oh, I'll blast through this.

**00:30:29** No problem.

**00:30:30** It's like, no, it's still quite a hard puzzle game even after 20 years.

**00:30:34** When I was doing that, someone mentioned Minecraft, which I didn't realize was

**00:30:38** still credibly popular.

**00:30:40** Like I just kind of assumed that it had faded away a little bit.

**00:30:43** I mean, I don't know if it's still now, but there was a time in the last year

**00:30:48** where it was again, the most popular video game in the world.

**00:30:51** Yeah.

**00:30:51** I mean, it's, it's has amazing staying power and yeah.

**00:30:55** So again, I just, I had a, some really frustrating days with trying to work on

**00:31:00** some videos and the Minecraft thing was just really nice.

**00:31:03** Like, Oh, I feel like I've done something in the day after a frustrating morning.

**00:31:09** And it's also just genuinely quite fun to play.

**00:31:13** So it's been this weird combination of one, like we've talked about streaming

**00:31:19** for years and years now, and it's, I think to anyone who's been with us, it

**00:31:22** has always been clear that I'm the one who has a much harder time with this and

**00:31:26** I don't get it.

**00:31:26** And I feel like I've never really figured it out and this is much more of me making

**00:31:33** a concerted effort to try to figure it out because it's just happened to work out

**00:31:38** that I have a couple of good games that I wanted to try anyway and a like bumpier

**00:31:45** period in the main script time.

**00:31:49** So yeah, so it's really just been a bunch of messing around is the long answer to

**00:31:54** why has this happened?

**00:31:56** It's just been like one thing on top of another.

**00:31:58** That's why it's happened.

**00:33:52** I mean, I can say from a business perspective, this is a good idea.

**00:33:56** Your numbers are incredible.

**00:33:58** I didn't realize you've been spying on me.

**00:33:59** I've been spying on you.

**00:34:00** Yeah.

**00:34:01** I mean, YouTube actively tells me when it's happening, like you can't get away

**00:34:05** from it, which is really interesting.

**00:34:08** Oh, it's good.

**00:34:08** This is good.

**00:34:09** Right.

**00:34:09** I think that, okay.

**00:34:11** Cause here's the, like, when I first saw it, I was like, why would you stream on

**00:34:14** YouTube like Twitch is the place, right?

**00:34:16** For streaming.

**00:34:17** It's just about a platform for it because it's built around it, right?

**00:34:20** Like that's what Twitch is.

**00:34:22** YouTube's like trying to make fetch happen, you know, like that they are

**00:34:26** really trying with live streaming, but people go to Twitch because it's kind of

**00:34:30** the expectation now is that's where you live stream, but you have this in-built

**00:34:36** audience there already subscribed.

**00:34:40** YouTube wants to tell them, like every time you're streaming, you are the top

**00:34:45** video in my subscriptions list, no matter what's coming in, they put you right up

**00:34:50** there and you're like live.

**00:34:52** So like for you, I think it makes perfect sense to stream on YouTube rather than

**00:34:57** cause then, I mean, honestly, like if you did on Twitch, you would then be having

**00:35:00** a third option, right?

**00:35:03** Right.

**00:35:04** Of like now you have these subscribers and where do they go?

**00:35:08** There is something to be said about the diversification of that, which is

**00:35:12** intriguing, but I feel like would add so much on top that probably makes it more

**00:35:20** complicated.

**00:35:21** And also just from watching, like it seems like it is a really great way to

**00:35:26** encourage people to subscribe because when you're streaming live, if you are a

**00:35:31** person who watches live streams, you're very used to the idea of this will

**00:35:37** encourage people to subscribe.

**00:35:39** And then at least with the YouTube stuff, they get additional benefits that

**00:35:42** don't really count on Twitch, right?

**00:35:43** Like Twitch is just kind of like, I support this creator now.

**00:35:46** I don't see ads and I get some emotes.

**00:35:49** But at least with the YouTube stuff, I assume from what I could glean, if

**00:35:53** somebody supports you by like subbing while you're live, they also get all of

**00:35:58** the benefits that you would get as a patron slash regular subscriber.

**00:36:04** So there is definitely something to be said for someone like you using YouTube

**00:36:09** as your live streaming platform rather than trying to start something new on

**00:36:13** Twitch.

**00:36:14** And I've also found it like intriguing to watch some of these streams because

**00:36:20** it's so different content wise to the stuff that you normally make, right?

**00:36:24** Because it's live, which is not a thing that you really do.

**00:36:30** And I was kind of intrigued as to how that makes you feel to be creating live.

**00:36:37** Yeah.

**00:36:37** I mean, when, well, you know, when you pitched me on Cortex years ago, I

**00:36:41** remember one of my main points was like, just so you understand, this will

**00:36:46** never be live, right?

**00:36:47** Yeah.

**00:36:47** Cause you were, you were doing other shows live.

**00:36:49** Most of my other shows, especially my weekly shows, we stream them live.

**00:36:55** People can listen in our members discord.

**00:36:56** They can listen on the web.

**00:36:58** It's just a thing that I've always done.

**00:37:01** So it's just a thing that I do.

**00:37:03** I don't particularly feel like that there is a reason, like this other shows

**00:37:07** that I do that I don't stream live, it adds, and it also makes some things

**00:37:11** more tricky at the same time for the shows that are like quite news

**00:37:14** focus and information heavy.

**00:37:16** It can be useful because the live stream actually provides information.

**00:37:20** Right.

**00:37:21** But say for a show like ours, the one we're doing right now, I don't think

**00:37:25** streaming live would help.

**00:37:26** It would actually make the show harder to make.

**00:37:28** Oh yeah.

**00:37:28** Yeah.

**00:37:29** Yeah.

**00:37:29** I just back in the day, like you, you would have wanted it to be live.

**00:37:34** And I think I was very firm on not live.

**00:37:38** Please know.

**00:37:39** Yeah.

**00:37:39** Yes.

**00:37:40** And it's for the best for this show.

**00:37:42** I mean, there has been one live appearance ever, right?

**00:37:45** When you came to San Francisco and we did a segment.

**00:37:48** Right.

**00:37:48** But so I just find it very interesting to watch you creating live.

**00:37:54** Yeah.

**00:37:54** I mean, there's so much in what you've just already said is, and this is, this

**00:37:57** is where I really feel like I'm, I'm trying to figure it out.

**00:38:01** I am concerned about the notification issue.

**00:38:06** I don't think it's a problem, but I just don't know.

**00:38:10** And it's not a problem.

**00:38:11** It's early days.

**00:38:12** It's not a problem.

**00:38:13** I mean, well, okay.

**00:38:15** It will maybe become a problem if you streamed a lot and then people turn off

**00:38:19** notifications and they don't get notifications for the videos anymore.

**00:38:22** But that's not a thing that you can work out.

**00:38:25** And as well, it's like, if you start relying on the notifications to tell people

**00:38:29** when you're streaming live, you are then at the whim of YouTube again, as to when

**00:38:33** they may or may not send that notification that you expect.

**00:38:37** Yeah.

**00:38:37** And also like how, how much sense this makes to do long-term.

**00:38:41** Like I just don't know.

**00:38:43** You know, I suspect that a lot of this might just be a kind of novelty

**00:38:47** effect at the moment, like it's, it's novel for me, which is what makes it

**00:38:50** interesting, but, and it can also just be novel for some people to watch it.

**00:38:54** Yeah.

**00:38:54** There's, there's always a novelty to stuff like this.

**00:38:56** Yeah.

**00:38:57** I think one of the other big things about having direct support be the main

**00:39:01** thing that supports the channel that, you know, now that I've been doing this

**00:39:06** for a while is I've realized like I have to have a visible reminder that this is

**00:39:14** a thing that people can do now that like the business and the people that I work

**00:39:19** with depend on this as an income source, because what happens over time with any

**00:39:24** of these kinds of things is like, okay, if I make a video that says, you know,

**00:39:28** please support me on Patreon or whatever over time, the number of people who are

**00:39:33** there decay just as like credit cards expire or people like lose interest or whatever.

**00:39:39** There's always a certain amount of churn.

**00:39:42** And like, it's a thing that I've, if the business depends on this, I have to

**00:39:47** promote it in some way, but I am just, I'm deeply uncomfortable with the direct ask.

**00:39:56** Like I've, I've done it, you know, two or three times in 10 years, which is not

**00:40:03** enough if the business actually needs to depend on this as the primary source of income.

**00:40:08** So one of the things that I've been doing with this is just to have a visible reminder

**00:40:14** to people that like, Oh, you can support the channel.

**00:40:17** And if you do, there are perks and it is one of the things that's quite interesting

**00:40:22** about YouTube members to me is it does make it very visually and immediately obvious

**00:40:31** to people, Hey, there's more content here.

**00:40:34** Like I always find it quite interesting with the creators that I support on

**00:40:37** Patreon that I almost never consume their additional contents.

**00:40:43** It's a pain.

**00:40:44** Is this there?

**00:40:44** It's a pain.

**00:40:45** Yeah.

**00:40:45** And if something is old, it's very hard to go back and to find it.

**00:40:51** I have a couple of people that I support on Patreon.

**00:40:53** And one of the things that they'll do is you get the video early, right?

**00:40:58** So they send me an email and then I have to open the email and then I want to save the

**00:41:05** video to my watch later queue, which means I didn't have to sign into YouTube again, even

**00:41:10** though I'm already signed in another tab, right?

**00:41:12** And then open the video and then press the button.

**00:41:15** It's a pain.

**00:41:16** It doesn't just show up where I want it to be.

**00:41:20** So for like, for more text, people subscribe and it's in their feed.

**00:41:24** It's like if every time we were like, we sent people an email every month, which had

**00:41:28** an MP3 attached to it, which had the additional content and it's like, you can go

**00:41:34** listen to this now, right?

**00:41:36** Like it's like, it doesn't, it's not meeting people where they are.

**00:41:41** And I think that's the interesting part of you leaning into what YouTube's offering

**00:41:47** as well as what Patreon's offering, because it really is leaning into where your

**00:41:53** customers are already, which is YouTube.

**00:41:57** So yeah, so I mean, part of the experience that I had, which also made me consider

**00:42:01** this is I signed up for a couple of people's memberships on YouTube myself and found,

**00:42:08** Oh, I'm actually watching the additional stuff that they create.

**00:42:13** I mean, it may be literally true a thousand percent more because I would

**00:42:17** basically never watch it on Patreon.

**00:42:19** And I've caught myself thinking, Oh, there's some channels like I wish they

**00:42:23** would put their stuff on YouTube.

**00:42:25** So I don't know that it's, it's interesting.

**00:42:27** And the, you know, the, the program is still in beta.

**00:42:29** So I'm a little bit limited about what I can say about it.

**00:42:32** But what I can say is it presents this real split where, you know, when someone

**00:42:38** is supporting the channel, it works much better for me.

**00:42:45** If they do that on Patreon, like all things being equal, I would much prefer

**00:42:51** someone to sign up on Patreon by a big margin, but I know as a user, it's way

**00:43:00** more convenient if it's right there on YouTube.

**00:43:04** So it's an interesting split.

**00:43:06** And I think, well, if I was a supporter of me, I would prefer to sign up on YouTube.

**00:43:15** And so that's one of the reasons why I'm just kind of giving it a try

**00:43:19** and seeing how things go.

**00:43:22** You know, it's, it's funny cause like, obviously I had the 10 year thing that

**00:43:25** we talked about last time or the time before.

**00:43:28** And so obviously I've been thinking a lot about the next 10 years of the business.

**00:43:32** Yeah.

**00:43:33** And, you know, again, I really want to lean on direct support quite a lot through,

**00:43:38** you know, memberships and through merchandise, you know, weird stuff like

**00:43:42** the stamp or whatever, but one of the things that sort of dawned on me is that

**00:43:46** I think I've been doing my career in a little bit of a reverse way from the way

**00:43:53** a lot of content creator production facilities go, where my early stuff was

**00:44:00** also much less personal and over the last 10 years, I think there has been a

**00:44:08** trend towards more personal and I've also trended away from advertising.

**00:44:17** And like both of those are very in the opposite direction of the way most

**00:44:21** things go, that as a channel gets bigger, often one of the things that people want

**00:44:26** to do is they want to try to more formalize like what's the system?

**00:44:30** How does this work?

**00:44:31** How do we make this more reproducible?

**00:44:33** And like, that's how you, you make a bigger business, but I've realized I'm,

**00:44:37** I'm very happy to lean into the channel actually becoming just more personal

**00:44:43** over time, which is why like, Oh, the vlogs have gone up.

**00:44:47** And that's also why I feel comfortable experimenting with the live streaming

**00:44:53** stuff, because that then feels incredibly personal on the spectrum.

**00:44:57** It's, it's like, Oh, I'm here right now.

**00:45:00** You're listening to me talk and I'm just kind of playing a video game.

**00:45:05** And so there's something incredibly unserious and hang outy about it.

**00:45:12** I'm pleased you said that, uh, cause I wanted to say this, you probably won't

**00:45:17** like it, but I'm going to say it anyway.

**00:45:19** So like in watching you play the game, I, I see more of who I know because

**00:45:29** you're, there is more like silliness because you're playing a video game.

**00:45:35** And so like, it's funny and you're doing silly things.

**00:45:37** And I know that side of you more and it's not the side of you that comes

**00:45:42** out in your videos, especially like most of the time, right?

**00:45:46** Like most of the times you are presenting something and it's serious, right?

**00:45:49** And that is what people see from you.

**00:45:52** But in the live streaming stuff, because it's happening live, your natural

**00:45:58** reaction to things is coming out more.

**00:46:02** Right?

**00:46:03** Like I was watching you build a train track and I think at one moment you

**00:46:07** pressed a button and the train can't flew away and you know, you're

**00:46:11** just like giggling up a storm.

**00:46:14** Trains are fun.

**00:46:15** Yeah.

**00:46:15** And it's like, it's, there's a spectrum.

**00:46:17** I think that people would see you on, right?

**00:46:18** So people that watch the YouTube videos see one side of you, people who listen

**00:46:23** to the podcasts get a little bit more of that, right?

**00:46:25** Like a little bit more of you as the full person, but content where it's live.

**00:46:33** Just naturally you will give more of you, like the whole you, because it's not

**00:46:39** written, it's not planned in advance.

**00:46:41** It's not being presented.

**00:46:43** You're just playing the game and being yourself.

**00:46:46** So all of this is to say, if the goal is to give more of your personal side,

**00:46:53** because that is the way that the business continues with a direct support model.

**00:46:57** Things like live streaming, I think are a very good thing to continue and to add

**00:47:02** in because it does open you up a little bit more as a person and as a creator.

**00:47:10** Because people get to see more of who you are.

**00:47:13** And I think that that is why, you know, like I'm watching, I've seen lots

**00:47:17** of people was subscribing and that's kind of the way that I see the popular

**00:47:21** Twitch creators that I watch.

**00:47:23** You know, the more you watch the more you're like, Oh, subscribe because I enjoy.

**00:47:27** I just, I'm having fun here over a period of time.

**00:47:31** You know, so like, I think if that is your goal, I think that this

**00:47:36** helps continue to further that.

**00:47:38** Yeah.

**00:47:39** I would, I would say less as like, it's the goal, but more like it's okay.

**00:47:45** Right.

**00:47:45** Like it's okay to have more personal stuff.

**00:47:49** And this, this again is where I was really worried about having two vlogs in a row.

**00:47:53** And like, Oh, it turned out fine.

**00:47:56** And I think this is, this is a side effect of audience expectations.

**00:48:00** Again, people know what the deal is.

**00:48:02** You know, again, I'm slightly worried because the YouTube streams are

**00:48:06** subscriber net negative if I look in the, in the backend, but they're not very net

**00:48:12** negative.

**00:48:12** What does that, what do you mean?

**00:48:13** What does that mean?

**00:48:14** So I mean, like if I do a stream, I lose subscribers on that stream.

**00:48:19** Oh, you mean overall, so this is where, okay.

**00:48:22** This is where naming is difficult because subscribers, the people that pay you money.

**00:48:28** Uh, I know.

**00:48:29** I know.

**00:48:29** It's like this, this, this is one of the like sidebar.

**00:48:33** I'm always harping on this.

**00:48:35** Like I think YouTube should just ditch the whole concept of subscribers, but they

**00:48:39** can't because they built their dumb awards around it.

**00:48:41** But I've thought forever, like they need to get rid of this.

**00:48:44** Well, I saw a change in now, like, so we're recording this just as Apple's

**00:48:47** launched their Apple podcast subscriptions thing, which obviously there is a

**00:48:51** parallel to that conversation, but it's too early for me to even have formed a

**00:48:56** full opinion on this program, but Apple and Apple podcasts now has follow and

**00:49:02** subscribe and follow.

**00:49:04** Oh, that's way better.

**00:49:05** Follow is the, what people do for our show right now, right?

**00:49:09** Like the vast majority of our listeners, they are now like, if they use Apple

**00:49:13** podcasts, following us, they've just, and what we would always have always called

**00:49:17** subscribe to the show, right?

**00:49:19** Right.

**00:49:19** Yes.

**00:49:20** But then you have the membership and the paid stuff and that is now a subscription.

**00:49:25** I mean, I'm just old school, so I'm used to it, but I wouldn't mind if this naming

**00:49:29** actually just changed and just standardized because now I'm used to with

**00:49:32** Twitch subscriptions is where the money occurs.

**00:49:36** That's where there's an exchange of whatever.

**00:49:38** I now want just please standardize this language across the platforms.

**00:49:44** Right.

**00:49:44** Yeah.

**00:49:45** No, I didn't know Apple changed the language and I'm a hundred percent behind

**00:49:50** that.

**00:49:50** I think subscribe has, it's an anachronistic word.

**00:49:52** It doesn't make sense.

**00:49:53** It's confusing.

**00:49:54** It's confusing even between right now and this moment, two professionals talking

**00:49:58** about what's going on.

**00:49:59** And I was like, Oh, I'm net negative on subscribers.

**00:50:01** You go, wow, that was like, Oh, I don't think it's a big deal at all.

**00:50:08** Whereas, whereas it's like, Oh, if my direct supporters were abandoning me in

**00:50:12** mass when I streamed is like, I would stop streaming real fast.

**00:50:16** Like, you know, so it's, it's, they're all refunds.

**00:50:22** Yeah.

**00:50:22** It's, it's hard to talk about, but I guess what I was trying to say there is I'm

**00:50:26** worried about the notifications thing.

**00:50:28** I know that the people who follow me on YouTube with the subscription button,

**00:50:33** that number goes negative when I stream, but not by a lot.

**00:50:37** And I also easily expect that's hugely disproportionate to people who like just

**00:50:43** signed up on the last main video.

**00:50:45** Like I would bet 80% of those unsubscribes are people who just subscribed

**00:50:50** when they found metric paper.

**00:50:51** And then they're like, Oh, this is a.

**00:50:53** Nostalgia streaming channel.

**00:50:55** I didn't know that.

**00:50:56** Like unsubscribe.

**00:50:57** Or it is the far less engaged person who is now annoyed that this is happening,

**00:51:04** but they were not going to particularly watch every video or ever sign up.

**00:51:10** Yeah.

**00:51:10** Yeah.

**00:51:10** Anyway.

**00:51:11** And this, this is also where one of the things related to the whole concept

**00:51:16** of YouTube subscriptions is I'm trying to just psychologically let go of, you know,

**00:51:23** it's a bit like the serenity prayer and you know, Hey, you know what you have

**00:51:25** to say the serenity prayer about when does YouTube notify people about your

**00:51:29** videos and it's like, well, you know, don't spend a lot of time and energy

**00:51:33** on the things you can't control and you don't know about.

**00:51:36** So it's like, I don't have any idea when YouTube notifies people about the

**00:51:41** main videos or the streams, it's incredibly difficult to even try to get

**00:51:45** any kind of idea of when that happens.

**00:51:47** So it's like, you know what, whatever I'm going to just give up and let YouTube

**00:51:53** sort it out and I don't know, maybe YouTube will figure out at some point

**00:51:57** which people do or don't want game streams and which people want the main videos.

**00:52:02** Like, but that's also where I'm not as confident as that, like, Oh, I'm not

**00:52:06** going to worry thing, you know, as that sounds like, well, you know, we'll see

**00:52:09** how this pans out in the future, but yeah, I guess the original idea here about like

**00:52:13** just being more personal is also trying to eliminate the complexities is it makes

**00:52:20** more sense to just consolidate everything onto the main YouTube channel.

**00:52:27** So it's like, I used to have that's the secondary channel for streaming games,

**00:52:31** but that doesn't make sense anymore.

**00:52:33** Once there's the members program, like this is where, Oh, that just kind of has

**00:52:38** to go because I don't want three places where people try to sign up and they

**00:52:43** don't work with each other and it's confusing.

**00:52:45** And you have enough control where it doesn't mess up the video

**00:52:50** list and stuff like that.

**00:52:51** Yes.

**00:52:52** Yeah.

**00:52:52** You don't get all these game videos intermixed.

**00:52:55** Like you're able to kind of like split them out.

**00:52:58** Yeah.

**00:52:58** I think it's clear that YouTube is interested in this as an important

**00:53:04** future part of their platform.

**00:53:05** And I don't know if they're going to continue doing this, but it is a big deal

**00:53:09** to me that, yeah, this kind of stuff doesn't show up as main video stuff.

**00:53:15** It's very clearly separated from the main videos.

**00:53:19** This allows me to have it be much more obvious.

**00:53:22** Like, Hey guys, this is bonus, not serious stuff.

**00:53:26** This isn't what the channel is.

**00:53:29** It's just like these extra things.

**00:53:30** So it does allow me to consolidate this stuff.

**00:53:33** But I think thinking about the channel long-term, it's helped me also realize

**00:53:38** it makes sense and it's fine to consolidate all of these things.

**00:53:43** My audience, I think after 10 years gets it that there's going to be random

**00:53:47** things all the time on the channel.

**00:53:49** It's not advice that I would generally give, this is what I mean by like, it's

**00:53:54** the reverse of how I see most YouTube channels go that I think many people

**00:54:01** as their channels grow, it makes way more sense to do spin-off and secondary channels.

**00:54:07** And I think for almost any creator, if they're asking me, Oh, they want to do

**00:54:12** a very different kind of thing.

**00:54:13** It's like, you should have a separate channel, but that's also dependent on

**00:54:18** the whole business model of like embedded sponsorships are very important

**00:54:22** for most content creators.

**00:54:23** So it's just a very different position that I find myself in.

**00:54:27** I do think that we're on a bit of an inflection point with this type of stuff, though.

**00:54:32** What do you mean?

**00:54:33** So I think that the pandemic has forced a lot of creators to consider

**00:54:37** their revenue streams differently.

**00:54:39** And so there is a lot more trend in towards asking people to, you know, if

**00:54:44** you like the content, support the content, and we'll try and give you

**00:54:48** something extra for that, right?

**00:54:51** And so I expect there to be a lot more of people doing the type of thing that

**00:54:56** you are attempting to do right now of leaning into the main source, providing

**00:55:03** some kind of incentive to build a larger support base and rely less on

**00:55:09** advertising.

**00:55:10** I'm not confident about that as a general statement, but I don't know.

**00:55:14** Maybe, maybe.

**00:55:15** I think that 2020 has highlighted the fragility of advertising based support

**00:55:22** models.

**00:55:24** So I can imagine a lot more people thinking, okay, there is a market for

**00:55:31** people to want to support, whether it's once or on an ongoing basis.

**00:55:37** And as long as creators continue to find a good balance, right?

**00:55:42** Like it's not going to work for people, in my opinion, who are like, all right,

**00:55:46** I'm just going to say my content is now all behind a paywall.

**00:55:50** That's not the way to do it.

**00:55:51** Right.

**00:55:52** If you can provide a value proposition, then they will give you their money.

**00:55:56** Like I know this because it's working for us.

**00:55:58** I know this is me as a consumer of content.

**00:56:02** Like I want to give money to people that I like and to get something out of it.

**00:56:08** So, I mean, this is more of just like, I agree with what you're saying about

**00:56:12** you're doing things kind of in reverse to the typical creator.

**00:56:15** Cause typically a creator begins and they have a small audience.

**00:56:18** They ask that audience for help.

**00:56:19** It helps them grow.

**00:56:20** They get numbers, they get advertising and they grow from there.

**00:56:24** And you have kind of gone in the reverse a little bit.

**00:56:27** I mean, there is a thing of like, when you started, there wasn't really a lot of

**00:56:30** options for direct support though.

**00:56:31** So, you know, it's that it is a slight inaccuracy in that thinking, right?

**00:56:36** Like Patreon didn't exist.

**00:56:38** You know, none of these things existed.

**00:56:40** But the point that I'm making is I do think that larger creators now are

**00:56:45** considering direct support more than they would have say in 2019.

**00:56:52** Yeah.

**00:56:52** I think, I think that's totally fair.

**00:56:54** But they're not doing what you're doing, which is them all saying, Hey, I'm not

**00:56:57** doing ads anymore on the YouTube channel.

**00:57:00** Well, like most creators, like say me as well, like with the membership stuff that

**00:57:05** we're doing, we still do ads, but we also have direct support as well.

**00:57:10** But you've gone an extra step in saying, Hey, I'm taking this leap now.

**00:57:16** Please help.

**00:57:17** Right?

**00:57:17** Like that's the difference.

**00:57:19** It's like it was a bigger step that you took, which does put you on the, on the

**00:57:23** news, but anyway, we have gone way into the reservation now.

**00:57:26** I want to bring us right back into live streaming.

**00:57:29** One of the things that I found, it was funny to me is hearing you do the live

**00:57:35** streaming thing, which is the convention of live streaming.

**00:57:38** When someone subscribes or becomes a member, whatever the word is, you say like,

**00:57:45** thanks, Jane, you know, like that's what you need to do.

**00:57:49** And when I turned on, like I turned on, she was like, is he going to do that?

**00:57:52** Cause I just wasn't sure.

**00:57:54** Right.

**00:57:54** Cause this is new for you.

**00:57:55** I remember when I first ever started streaming, I didn't know you needed to

**00:57:59** do those things and people were like, why are you not interacting with us?

**00:58:03** And like, I was like, I did.

**00:58:04** I didn't know I had to write the kit.

**00:58:06** So when it's very strange, when you start, but you were doing it, you know, you're

**00:58:10** like, thanks, Billy Bob for the, for joining or whatever the words are.

**00:58:14** Yeah.

**00:58:14** All my words are still very complicated.

**00:58:17** It takes a while.

**00:58:18** Like it really takes a while.

**00:58:19** Cause again, like Twitch is much more complicated too, because there are like

**00:58:25** follows subs, bits gifted, like it's a much broader.

**00:58:29** Oh, great.

**00:58:30** Sign me up for Twitch.

**00:58:31** This sounds like what I need.

**00:58:33** I mean, I will say as a creator and as a consumer, I think Twitch is better at

**00:58:36** this stuff, but again, it's not the right option for you.

**00:58:39** The right option for you is to stream on YouTube because it just makes so much sense.

**00:58:44** There is like this whole vernacular that you need to use.

**00:58:47** And it was like, cause I could feel you were trying to like, you're trying to find

**00:58:51** it, right?

**00:58:52** Like, cause it is, it's very, again, it's super different to all of the other types

**00:58:56** of content that you make in that way.

**00:58:59** Yeah.

**00:58:59** I'm totally inexperienced with this.

**00:59:01** And also I have the additional problem, which is because there are two ways

**00:59:06** that people can sign up.

**00:59:07** I have two chat rooms that I'm managing, which is very like, Oh God, where am I

**00:59:13** looking?

**00:59:13** Like it's very, it's, it's, it is surprisingly hard.

**00:59:17** So then it was like, Oh, great streaming.

**00:59:19** And then she was watching.

**00:59:20** I don't understand the chat.

**00:59:21** And I was like, okay, so he's kind of got these two, he's got the discord and the

**00:59:25** YouTube chat, but why are they both there?

**00:59:27** I said, yeah, cause they just have to be right.

**00:59:29** Like, so now I, so this is one of the things that I want to give you feedback on.

**00:59:34** What tool are you using?

**00:59:35** What software are you using?

**00:59:36** Uh, stream labs, OBS.

**00:59:38** That's what I'm using.

**00:59:39** Cause I think one of the ways that you can benefit from this is some visual

**00:59:43** design to the stream.

**00:59:46** What do you mean?

**00:59:47** My streams are beautiful.

**00:59:48** Gorgeous, like really amazing.

**00:59:50** Uh, there are, you know, like there are visual tricks that you can play for

**00:59:55** putting things in boxes and stuff like that.

**00:59:57** And, and you know, you will see this with the stream.

**01:00:01** You know, you, you kind of have a layout.

**01:00:03** I don't remember the exact name of it now, but you can kind of set up a layout and

**01:00:06** I just think your layout could do with some refinement to make things a bit clearer.

**01:00:11** I have refined it quite a lot.

**01:00:13** Actually, it's great.

**01:00:15** Yeah.

**01:00:16** I mean, I mean, in all seriousness, this is just, this is just the problem of like

**01:00:19** the complication versus just getting it done issue.

**01:00:23** And I don't know, like stream labs, you recommended it to me and I do quite like

**01:00:29** it, but I, I constantly run into just tons of technical problems with all of the

**01:00:35** streaming software, technical problems that are completely baffling, you know,

**01:00:39** the kind of thing where you're following through someone's tutorial and then step

**01:00:42** six just doesn't work or like, Oh, that button doesn't exist.

**01:00:46** All right.

**01:00:46** Okay.

**01:00:47** So now we need to actually get into the real meat of this.

**01:00:50** Okay.

**01:00:51** If you're going to do this, you need a PC.

**01:00:54** I'm sorry.

**01:00:54** You don't want to hear it, but this is it because so many of the problems that you're

**01:01:00** having would be solved by using a PC.

**01:01:03** Cause when you say the button isn't there, you know where the button isn't

**01:01:05** there because it's in the windows version.

**01:01:08** It's not in the Mac version.

**01:01:09** And that's so many of the technical issues that you find yourself in because

**01:01:14** the Mac is not good at this.

**01:01:16** Right.

**01:01:16** No, I understand the Mac's not good at this, but I'm not, I'm not getting a whole

**01:01:20** other computer for that.

**01:01:21** Like this is you talk about now, like introducing more complexity.

**01:01:26** Every, every operating system is literally a universe unto itself.

**01:01:31** No, I know.

**01:01:32** Right.

**01:01:32** And you're like, okay, you can't get subscriber names to pop up nice on the

**01:01:36** screen.

**01:01:36** Well, don't worry, just pop over into this parallel universe where all the

**01:01:40** physics are different and you can solve this problem.

**01:01:42** It's like, guess what?

**01:01:43** I don't need to solve the problem that badly.

**01:01:46** Like it's fine.

**01:01:48** What I'm saying to you is for what you're doing right now, right?

**01:01:53** Right now is fine.

**01:01:55** But if this is a thing that you will want to continue.

**01:02:02** It is my strong recommendation that you make your life easier for yourself

**01:02:07** ultimately in having a small form factor PC.

**01:02:11** Yeah.

**01:02:11** But you're, you're, you're presuming that it will make my life easier.

**01:02:14** I know.

**01:02:15** I know.

**01:02:15** I don't think that it will.

**01:02:17** Like I really don't think that it will.

**01:02:18** I have been on this journey.

**01:02:20** I know how much easier it can be.

**01:02:23** But my PC is just set now.

**01:02:27** I do two things on it.

**01:02:28** Nothing ever changes.

**01:02:30** It works great.

**01:02:32** Of course I get the occasional issue, which is solved by unplugging and

**01:02:35** re-plugging a USB device, but that is like the majority of the issues that I

**01:02:40** have is just that if that, right?

**01:02:42** It's like once you set it up and you get it fixed in the way that you want,

**01:02:47** as long as you don't do anything else to the PC, which I don't, cause I only

**01:02:49** use it for this, it's fine.

**01:02:51** Yeah.

**01:02:52** But look, Mike, what are you trying to sell me here?

**01:02:54** All I have right now is, oh, cool.

**01:02:56** There's Minecraft on the right and there's discord chat on the left.

**01:03:01** Great.

**01:03:01** Like it's, I'm good.

**01:03:03** Like that's fine.

**01:03:05** It works fine.

**01:03:06** Well, all I'm saying is I agree with you for right now, but again, if this is

**01:03:10** something that like it becomes a thing in your portfolio that you do frequently.

**01:03:18** My recommendation is you make your life easier and the stream more professional

**01:03:23** looking by enhancing some things.

**01:03:25** So you get some scenes made for yourself, right?

**01:03:28** So like you end up with a more visual design to the stream where things are

**01:03:32** broken up and laid out a bit better.

**01:03:35** And then you also have a PC that can render Minecraft draw distances and also

**01:03:41** stream at the same time for you putting this out there to you.

**01:03:46** It's just like, just like, no, but this is like this, I don't know, to be

**01:03:49** like, this is, this is like antithetical to what I'm actually doing here.

**01:03:53** Like number one, I'm not actually going to be a daily streamer.

**01:03:57** Oh, of course you're not.

**01:03:58** Yeah, I've been doing it a bunch, you know, because there's been a confluence

**01:04:02** of events that have made it happen more frequently.

**01:04:05** Like I think I would like to be able to do this somewhat frequently

**01:04:08** going forward into the future.

**01:04:10** I don't really know what that means, but I wouldn't expect that

**01:04:12** it is as frequent as it has been.

**01:04:14** I have a question for you.

**01:04:15** Yeah.

**01:04:16** Why do you have a writing computer?

**01:04:21** No, Mike, now you're just trying to start a fight here.

**01:04:23** I'm not trying to start a fight.

**01:04:24** I'm just asking, I'm just a question that I have for you is why

**01:04:28** do you have a writing computer?

**01:04:32** The purpose of the writing computer is to try to physically separate the work.

**01:04:37** I know where you're going with this.

**01:04:38** Where I don't know where I'm not going anywhere.

**01:04:40** I just, I just couldn't remember.

**01:04:44** Look, the writing computer is very simple.

**01:04:46** It's for writing.

**01:04:48** It's for podcasting.

**01:04:50** It's also a server.

**01:04:52** It's also a server for all of my video files and it's a Hazel machine that

**01:04:58** automatically categorizes and sorts all of the video footage that I shoot.

**01:05:02** It's my fastest computer.

**01:05:04** So it's also with my rendering computer when I'm short on time.

**01:05:07** And it's also my video game streaming computer now.

**01:05:10** So that that's what the writing computer does.

**01:05:13** Right.

**01:05:14** Okay.

**01:05:17** I mean, but just, just to, just to finish the point, like I, I do

**01:05:23** I know what you're saying about, you know, getting a PC and trying

**01:05:28** to make things more professional.

**01:05:29** I do get it.

**01:05:29** Like, even though I'm giving you a hard time about that, I under, I understand

**01:05:32** your point, but part of this for me is like, but I am not a professional streamer.

**01:05:40** No, I'm not recommending like you're doing this anytime soon.

**01:05:44** Yeah.

**01:05:45** If it doesn't feel like I'm actually just playing this game and I'm enjoying this,

**01:05:50** I'm not going to do it.

**01:05:51** Like it doesn't really make sense for me to do as a business.

**01:05:56** Like it makes sense for me to do as a fun bonus thing for people who support

**01:06:02** the channel and it also makes sense.

**01:06:04** If it's a fun thing for me to do in the afternoon, when I wouldn't be

**01:06:09** doing anything else anyway, like I'd just be sitting around.

**01:06:12** So this is why it all makes sense.

**01:06:14** And like, you have to be careful about how much you professionalize some things.

**01:06:19** And I feel cautious about this.

**01:06:22** Nobody understands this more than me, right?

**01:06:25** Because like, this is exactly where I am.

**01:06:27** Right?

**01:06:27** Like I stream every week, but it's my fun thing that I do.

**01:06:30** I look forward to it.

**01:06:31** And I don't want to think of it as part of my like job so much because it

**01:06:37** would take some of the fun away.

**01:06:38** Like it's my hobby and it, but as a hobby, I get to share it with people and

**01:06:43** it's just something that I really enjoy.

**01:06:45** But it has become way less frustrating for me once I had the equipment in place

**01:06:53** to properly manage what I was trying to do.

**01:06:57** Because what I found was when I was trying to stream everything from my laptop,

**01:07:02** it worked most of the time because the laptop couldn't handle it.

**01:07:05** And it was like random where sometimes just like I would be at like seven

**01:07:10** frames per second, right?

**01:07:11** Just like, as I said before, I think it was like a people were joking and calling

**01:07:15** it like a PowerPoint presentation that made it less fun.

**01:07:20** Yeah.

**01:07:21** And when it made it less fun, it made it feel like work.

**01:07:24** So when I ended up investing, I built a new PC.

**01:07:27** I love my new PC.

**01:07:29** I have a parts list that I'll put in the show notes.

**01:07:31** People want to check it out.

**01:07:32** Now it's even more fun again because everything just runs so smoothly.

**01:07:37** I just turn everything on and I'm ready to go.

**01:07:39** It's just a joy.

**01:07:41** All I'm saying is I'm not recommending this for now because you don't know if

**01:07:45** this is even something you're going to be doing in six weeks time, right?

**01:07:47** Yeah.

**01:07:48** My suggestion is if you decide this is something that you want to do for fun,

**01:07:54** but also as a like community building exercise, my recommendation to you is

**01:08:00** to really strongly consider some things that will make the experience smoother.

**01:08:08** Recommendation noted, Mike.

**01:08:09** Yeah.

**01:08:10** Week.

**01:08:11** And again, like I just want to get this in your head, right?

**01:08:13** And like, but just keep doing what you're doing for now, right?

**01:08:16** It's only come up because you mentioned about the two chats, right?

**01:08:20** And like, that's what led me down this whole little round.

**01:08:23** Right.

**01:08:23** But your PC isn't going to solve the problem that there's, you know,

**01:08:26** there's two separate systems.

**01:08:27** No, there were two parts of this, right?

**01:08:29** Like the first part was having somebody create a more visual scene.

**01:08:34** It's going to call it scenes for you.

**01:08:36** Okay.

**01:08:36** Which could help highlight things.

**01:08:39** You could, you know, there could be some labeling as to like,

**01:08:40** why these things are both here.

**01:08:42** But then the other part of it was while I'm talking about this, let me also

**01:08:47** mention to you how much your life would be made easier if you had a Windows PC to do

**01:08:52** this with.

**01:08:53** Right.

**01:08:54** So that's what this intervention was.

**01:08:56** Yeah.

**01:08:56** This was like the other thing that I wanted to mention.

**01:08:59** Okay.

**01:09:00** In watching your streams and knowing how much easier and smoother and better

**01:09:05** looking they would be if you had hardware that could actually handle it.

**01:09:09** Yeah.

**01:09:09** I do think my bottleneck is actually the internet connection.

**01:09:13** It's not the hardware at this point.

**01:09:14** I think there's a bit of both.

**01:09:15** I mean, cause like stuff like your draw distance in Minecraft is

**01:09:18** not affected by your internet.

**01:09:19** Yes, that's, that's true.

**01:09:21** That is true.

**01:09:21** I don't have to draw distance at maximum, but I do really think 80% of the problem

**01:09:27** is the internet connection.

**01:09:28** And also I don't know anything about PCs and don't want to learn an entire other

**01:09:32** universe.

**01:09:33** Yeah.

**01:09:34** Yeah.

**01:09:34** No, trust me, Phil, you I've been there.

**01:09:37** It's not as bad as it seems now, but it's the thing is you choose

**01:09:41** whether you want to give into it or not.

**01:09:45** And I'll just tell you my, my favorite little thing that's happened so far

**01:09:48** with the streaming, it just made me laugh is I try very hard on the streams.

**01:09:53** Not to curse because if it's live, there's no bleeping, right?

**01:09:58** And so sometimes I curse on this podcast and you bleep it.

**01:10:02** And that always makes it funnier.

**01:10:03** A sense of you.

**01:10:03** Yes, exactly.

**01:10:04** The reason I take curses out of the show is it's easier for people that don't want

**01:10:08** it and it's also easier for people that are listening mixed company.

**01:10:12** Yeah, exactly.

**01:10:13** You don't know your it's mixed company is there's going to be a grandma with

**01:10:17** pearls that she will clutch if you curse.

**01:10:19** And you don't want that to be the case.

**01:10:21** Also, like I suspect with streams, it's much more of a background activity, you

**01:10:27** know, so it just, I don't know, it's just everything about it feels like you

**01:10:30** probably shouldn't curse.

**01:10:32** So I try not to curse.

**01:10:34** Although, of course, when you're playing video games, surprising things happen.

**01:10:37** Especially Minecraft.

**01:10:38** Minecraft is a dangerous game for no cursing.

**01:10:42** It is.

**01:10:42** It is dangerous because it is.

**01:10:46** It is the perfect example of, oh, you've spent two hours doing a thing.

**01:10:49** And then in two seconds, one stupid thing happens and you've just lost two hours

**01:10:54** of your life that you're never getting back in all of my years, anytime I've ever

**01:10:58** streamed, I think I have been 100% successful about not cursing.

**01:11:03** But on the very last stream I did once because I was just too surprised.

**01:11:08** I like, I turned around and it was just very surprised and cursed out loud.

**01:11:11** And what I loved is before I had even finished the stream, YouTube was like,

**01:11:17** Oh, we've demonetized this video for like, wow.

**01:11:24** Yeah.

**01:11:24** I saw the little like ineligible limited monetization language.

**01:11:30** I was like, boy, look at this.

**01:11:32** These bots, they sure know how to look like they are watching you with sharp eyes.

**01:11:38** I thought that was amazing.

**01:11:41** And horrifying.

**01:11:43** Yeah.

**01:11:43** So anyway, YouTube, they're always watching.

**01:12:58** Something I wanted to do recently was to create a kind of landing page for all

**01:13:01** the different projects that I have.

**01:13:03** And I've had a website, Mike Hurley dot net on Squarespace for a while and I

**01:13:06** haven't really done much with it.

**01:13:08** So I just spent some time one day.

**01:13:10** I put in a little bio about myself, some imagery, and then some links out to all

**01:13:14** of the different projects that I'm up to today.

**01:13:16** It was so easy.

**01:13:17** They had a template that was perfect for it.

**01:13:18** It was really easy to do to drop in a gallery of images.

**01:13:21** So, so simple.

**01:13:22** I really love how Squarespace gives me all of the tools that I need to do this

**01:13:26** in a way that makes sense to me.

**01:13:48** A thanks to Squarespace for the continued support of cortex and all of RelayFM.

**01:13:52** Great.

**01:13:52** Let's do some hashtag ask cortex questions.

**01:13:55** So cortex has have questions.

**01:13:56** We have answers.

**01:13:57** Maybe.

**01:13:59** I was like, do we, do we have answers?

**01:14:00** I don't know the answer to that.

**01:14:01** Well, we have answers.

**01:14:04** Right.

**01:14:04** They might not always be the answers people want or expect, but we do have them.

**01:14:10** Jan asks, what kind of art do you have or want in your offices?

**01:14:16** Where do you choose form over function?

**01:14:19** Maybe in regards to furniture.

**01:14:21** I mean, we'll be surprised.

**01:14:22** I generally prefer function over form, particularly in a, in a work environment.

**01:14:28** I mean, I do think it is nice to have some kind of matching, you know, so like

**01:14:33** I have, uh, the two desks in my office, one for the regular computer,

**01:14:37** one for the writing computer.

**01:14:39** They're the same.

**01:14:40** And when I got a storage unit, it was important to try to like match the

**01:14:44** wood so that it does look nice in the room.

**01:14:46** But yeah, in general, I care a lot more about office stuff being functional.

**01:14:51** And to that end, I don't have any art in my office.

**01:14:56** Like I painted the walls blue, which I love, but I don't have any like paintings

**01:15:01** on the walls, you know, none of that is, is something that I would really want.

**01:15:06** There's a window in my office, but it is permanently closed forever.

**01:15:10** But I guess the thing that I would want as art, I guess, is always kind of stuck

**01:15:16** with me, but there are, there are companies that make these fake windows.

**01:15:20** I don't know if you've ever seen this, like I run across this on the

**01:15:22** internet every once in a while and it's, it's one of these, like, how much money

**01:15:26** do you want to spend kind of questions?

**01:15:28** But yeah, there are companies that will make these fake windows that try to

**01:15:32** create the appearance of sunlight coming through them.

**01:15:35** Oh my God, this is so weird.

**01:15:37** I'm looking at some now where they put like images.

**01:15:40** Yeah.

**01:15:41** And so some of the better ones try to solve the parallax problem because like

**01:15:45** with artwork, obviously it doesn't have any depth to it because it's just a flat

**01:15:49** image and so some of the better windows try to solve for the parallax problem by

**01:15:53** having just a little bit of layers that's offset in a way, which exaggerates parallax.

**01:15:59** So it gives it a bit of depth as you, as you're walking past it.

**01:16:02** I'm looking at these ones now that are curved.

**01:16:04** Yes.

**01:16:05** Like that kind of stuff.

**01:16:06** I hate this.

**01:16:07** No, I know some of these are great.

**01:16:08** Like, you know, for people who have underground prepper bunkers, like, you

**01:16:12** know, the real millionaire billionaire people who do this kind of stuff, I was

**01:16:16** like, Oh, I have, I have this underground nuclear bunker, but also this window

**01:16:21** that's always shows me what it looks like in Hong Kong now or whatever.

**01:16:25** Like that's the kind of thing if money was no object and I could build my office

**01:16:30** from scratch, I think I would, I wouldn't have art, but I would love to have like

**01:16:36** the best fake windows money can buy.

**01:16:39** That's what I would put in my office.

**01:16:41** For me, I like to try and display things that are achievements.

**01:16:49** I have my prints from PodCon.

**01:16:52** Remember those?

**01:16:52** Yeah.

**01:16:53** Yeah.

**01:16:53** Of course.

**01:16:53** Those framed, I have some like those fracture prints of like little moments.

**01:16:59** I actually have a fracture of the aforementioned time that we were on stage

**01:17:04** together in San Francisco.

**01:17:05** I want to do more of it for the studio because the studio is just big blank

**01:17:11** walls, like these large white walls.

**01:17:14** But again, it's like, I haven't had the time to really decorate.

**01:17:17** So it's like, I have a clock that I really like that is just been

**01:17:20** sitting in a box for 10 months.

**01:17:23** I like the idea of having things in a workspace to make it feel personalized,

**01:17:30** to kind of take the edge off a little bit.

**01:17:33** I mean, honestly, this is part of like the aesthetic desire for fun keyboards.

**01:17:37** Yeah.

**01:17:37** I think I imagine, especially just being in a bigger space, you would have more

**01:17:42** desire to decorate something on the walls.

**01:17:45** Especially because, I mean, it's not very soft feeling in this.

**01:17:50** It's just like white brick wall.

**01:17:53** The coziest of decorations, white brick wall.

**01:17:57** John asks, I know Mike edits and posts the podcast, but what is the quote

**01:18:02** final cut ownership like on an episode?

**01:18:04** Does Gray just listen for mistakes and note corrections to Mike or do you both

**01:18:08** of you listen and edit it equally?

**01:18:12** I like that.

**01:18:12** Oh, Mike, I'll just send you my list of mistakes and I'll let you do it.

**01:18:17** I think that's really funny.

**01:18:17** I have had editing relationships like that.

**01:18:21** I mean, I think it can make sense.

**01:18:23** I just, that strikes me as funny.

**01:18:24** I mean, honestly, in some ways it's more logical than what we do, which is

**01:18:29** literally pass a logic project backwards and forwards, which is, I can't believe

**01:18:35** we haven't had a problem that's occurred from that.

**01:18:38** Yeah.

**01:18:38** Yeah.

**01:18:38** I mean, I'll give, I'll give logic a lot of credit for, you know, never, never

**01:18:42** really choking on that.

**01:18:44** That's worked really well.

**01:18:45** But I think this is also the case of we are both logic editors.

**01:18:49** Like it's, it's no big deal for me to open up a logic file and edit a podcast.

**01:18:53** Like it's super easy.

**01:18:54** It's way easier than working in final cut and is super fast.

**01:18:59** So I think, you know, I think there's two things going on here.

**01:19:03** It's like, okay, well, when both of us know how to use the same editing program

**01:19:08** that reduces a lot of friction.

**01:19:10** And when one of us is incredibly picky about a bunch of details, like it also

**01:19:17** makes, like I would never send you a list of like, oh, Mike, here's the couple little

**01:19:21** things that I want you to change.

**01:19:24** I tend to make a lot of very small edits on the final one, but honestly, I think

**01:19:32** it's the two of us working on this.

**01:19:34** That is part of why I think Cortex sounds really good is a podcast is I always

**01:19:40** want to be clear, like Mike is putting in 90% of the work.

**01:19:44** I just view my edit as I always have picky stuff that I just want to

**01:19:51** change or tweak a little bit.

**01:19:52** I have a question for you.

**01:19:54** Do you edit yourself more or me more?

**01:19:58** It depends.

**01:19:59** I mean, I think probably on average I edit myself way more.

**01:20:02** You know, I think this is just the human thing of you're always going to be more

**01:20:07** annoyed by little things that you do wrong, or you're more aware of when you've

**01:20:14** said things in a weird way.

**01:20:15** Like that was not what I intended, but if I cut this, it sounds closer

**01:20:20** to what I, what I meant to say.

**01:20:22** I edit you more than me.

**01:20:25** Oh, okay.

**01:20:26** That's totally shocking to me.

**01:20:27** Why?

**01:20:28** Um, I'm going to edit you more now.

**01:20:30** Go for it.

**01:20:31** See if I can edit me out.

**01:20:35** This is really funny.

**01:20:36** Cause like, I've always kind of assumed, Oh, Mike is giving me this file.

**01:20:42** He must be 100% happy with the way he sounds about everything because I'm not

**01:20:49** going to pass back the file to him until I've listened to it and make sure that

**01:20:53** I'm happy with the way I sound.

**01:20:55** I edit myself a lot, right?

**01:20:57** Like I'm not relying on you to do it for me.

**01:20:59** The reason I edit you more is because I know how picky you are for yourself.

**01:21:05** So I try and just pick up a lot of that.

**01:21:08** Thank you.

**01:21:09** I really appreciate that.

**01:21:10** Well, this is my, it's part of my job here is to edit the show.

**01:21:12** And so like as well, you have, I think more fixable verbal ticks.

**01:21:19** Then I do right.

**01:21:22** Everybody has verbal ticks.

**01:21:24** Yeah.

**01:21:24** I am just lucky that yours are more repairable more frequently than mine.

**01:21:29** I can't get rid of a lot of mine.

**01:21:31** What are your unremovable verbal texts?

**01:21:33** Oh, I'm not saying them on the show.

**01:21:35** Okay.

**01:21:35** Well you can tell me later.

**01:21:37** Right.

**01:21:37** Because then everyone will hear them all the time and we'll lose their minds.

**01:21:43** But you're quite controlled with yours, which makes it easy.

**01:21:46** One of them is the exact opposite of a verbal tick, which is you take a long time.

**01:21:50** You pause.

**01:21:51** Yes.

**01:21:51** That, yes, that is true.

**01:21:53** And your other thing is you just restate stuff a lot.

**01:21:56** Yes.

**01:21:56** Well, this is also the magic of it's not live is, Oh, I start this sentence and then,

**01:22:02** Oh, it's a car crash.

**01:22:03** And then you just wait, start over, start over, try that again and try to speak like

**01:22:08** a person who could speak in full sentences.

**01:22:12** Yeah.

**01:22:12** No extemporaneous speech is not my strong point, which is one of the reasons why it's

**01:22:17** like, Mike, this podcast will never be live.

**01:22:19** Well, great.

**01:22:19** I'll tell you, it's nobody's strong point.

**01:22:22** It really isn't extemporaneous speaking is incredibly difficult.

**01:22:26** Most podcasts are not edited like ours.

**01:22:29** They're just not because it just takes too much work.

**01:22:31** You wouldn't do it.

**01:22:33** Right.

**01:22:33** And it's like when I talk to people, like, especially with the mentorship program

**01:22:37** that I've been doing, when we talk about editing, I tell them the different ways

**01:22:41** that I edit, I tell them how I edit this show and suggest nobody edit like this.

**01:22:46** Right.

**01:22:47** It's not necessary to produce a good podcast.

**01:22:50** We just do it because this is what we do.

**01:22:53** Yeah.

**01:22:54** Yeah.

**01:22:54** I don't recommend people do things like we do.

**01:22:57** You know, like if I say the word, you're twice in a sentence, right?

**01:23:02** So like you're, you're, because I'm just restating it.

**01:23:04** I'll cut one of those out.

**01:23:06** Nobody notices that stuff, but I just don't want it there.

**01:23:10** So really the final cut ownership, I mean, it's kind of mine because you give me the

**01:23:16** final, final cut, but I don't really change a lot after you give it back to me.

**01:23:21** Because I was just thinking, I don't even know now.

**01:23:24** I don't know.

**01:23:25** Like you do listen to it again after I've edited it or not.

**01:23:28** No, I never listened to it again.

**01:23:30** Oh, okay.

**01:23:31** Yeah.

**01:23:31** See, there you go.

**01:23:32** You didn't, I can't, I don't have the time for that.

**01:23:34** Mike, we need to do three passes on his podcast.

**01:23:38** If you want that, you've got to get it to me a day earlier, right?

**01:23:42** Like that's the thing.

**01:23:43** I can't listen to the show if you're giving me the show on the day of the shows

**01:23:46** being posted.

**01:23:47** Mike, I don't understand the show needs to be posted on Tuesday at 4pm and I got it

**01:23:52** to you at 3pm.

**01:23:53** Didn't you listen at double speed?

**01:23:55** I don't understand that.

**01:23:55** What's wrong with you?

**01:23:57** No, I don't, I don't listen back again.

**01:23:59** Something that I do do is I would sometimes check the edits that you make.

**01:24:03** Sometimes I want to just tidy up a little bit.

**01:24:05** Yeah.

**01:24:05** Yeah.

**01:24:06** And it's easy because we edit differently.

**01:24:08** You crossfade everything so I can see where your edits are.

**01:24:11** Yes.

**01:24:11** And this, this is where I crossfade everything because I am not as good of

**01:24:15** an editor as you are.

**01:24:16** And so it's like crossfades makes it much easier.

**01:24:21** I open up Mike's one is like, no crossfades here.

**01:24:23** No, Mike doesn't rely on that low level noob trash.

**01:24:27** Like he doesn't need to do it.

**01:24:29** Mike just has hard cuts.

**01:24:30** Oh, an artisanal editor, sir.

**01:24:32** I find the natural point between the two words and match that up.

**01:24:37** No, of course fade in here.

**01:24:39** In all seriousness, Mike's podcast edits look like, I don't know what

**01:24:43** professional sushi cuts look like.

**01:24:45** Just these perfectly straight lines.

**01:24:47** And it's like, wham, wham, wham.

**01:24:49** And my edits look like trash.

**01:24:52** I've done this a few times.

**01:24:54** I'll include a link in the show notes to what the logic project just looks like

**01:24:59** at the end, because it really is kind of incredible to see what is often

**01:25:04** thousands of cuts and it's quite a sight to see sometimes.

**01:25:09** Yeah.

**01:25:09** I think again, I'll just reemphasize here that yes, no one should edit a show

**01:25:14** this way, but this is the byproduct of I'm very picky, but I genuinely think

**01:25:21** that for this show, it does make it much better.

**01:25:25** And I also think that this show has above average, at least re-listenability.

**01:25:33** And so that is something that I often have in mind when I'm doing my pass is

**01:25:38** someone may listen to this, not just once, but they may listen to it several times.

**01:25:42** And then it kind of changes the calculus in my head of if an edit is worth it or

**01:25:50** if it's, if it's worth tightening up this little section.

**01:25:52** So this is why most podcasts are more ephemeral.

**01:25:57** And then that's why it doesn't necessarily make sense to do like two and a half passes of it.

**01:26:03** So yeah.

**01:26:04** Cause it's also content.

**01:26:05** That's the thing we didn't mention.

**01:26:06** We do take things out, remove things, move stuff around to make the content of it

**01:26:10** sound better as well as just the raw speech of it, right?

**01:26:15** And that is again, just a very different thing.

**01:26:17** The content editing, I do recommend for people, depending on the type of

**01:26:20** show that they're making.

**01:26:22** Yes.

**01:26:22** This isn't something that I do all the time.

**01:26:24** I think you can remove the need for content editing by planning a lot.

**01:26:28** And then also just by paying attention while you're recording, you know, cause

**01:26:31** this shows that I do where I don't edit as heavily, but we'll remove stuff from the

**01:26:35** final eddings.

**01:26:36** I just know it didn't work, but this show, we do listen through it in that way to make

**01:26:41** sure that it is re-listenable and replayable.

**01:26:45** And again, it's like there are considerations that we make, which is this weird chicken

**01:26:49** and egg scenario that because the show is successful and has a large listenership, you

**01:26:53** edit it more tightly.

**01:26:56** But is the show successful because it's edited?

**01:26:59** That we'll never know.

**01:27:01** But that's this chicken and egg that we're in that we're happy with.

**01:27:05** But it's also why the show happens every month and not every week.

**01:27:09** It's impossible to know if the show is more successful because of the way that we edit

**01:27:14** it. But I know for sure that the answer is yes.

**01:27:17** Okay.

**01:27:17** Even though I also know that this is not generally applicable to all podcasts.

**01:27:22** That is perfectly acceptable, I think, to say all of what you've just said.

**01:27:27** And I'm pretty sure I agree with all of it.

**01:27:29** Great. I'm glad it only took me three tries to get it right in that sentence.

**01:27:32** But nobody will ever know.
